Are these symptoms similar to your experience?	M/24 healthy with no conditions (as far as I’m aware), non smoker. 27th March - felt very slightly warm, didn’t think much more of it 28th March - felt slightly feverish and very slight chills 29th March - got my hands on a digital thermometer and read 37.6°C (99.68°F) oral (I left the thermometer in my mouth for several minutes for all readings to ensure accuracy). 30th March to today - same borderline fever temperature. I have had no other symptoms besides a loss of appetite which came back today after taking anxiety medication Diazepam, I occasionally feel as though it is hard to breathe but that goes away (I’m pinning that on stress/anxiety) The average temp reading for the last 6-7 days has been 37.5°C (99.5°F) I have been told I am not eligible for a test as I am low risk, I am both happy and sad about this, I am happy that the test will hopefully go to someone that really needs it but at the same time I really want to know.

How late into infection would one test positive?	So, my wife and I have both been sick for about two weeks, although mildly: She has had not sense of taste and smell, and I had a low-grade fever for 3 days and a cough that was really bad for 5 days and is now just lingering. Telemedicine doc we talked to two Saturdays ago said he thought we both have it, but there was no way to get tested. Now, my wife’s doctor says we can come into their office tomorrow to get tested. Does anyone know, or has anyone seen any info, as to how long after symptoms first manifest a test would come back positive? We’re still very mildly symptomatic, but I’ve also read that this thing only tends to run two weeks. My concern being, I guess, that we’d come back negative now, even though we did have it. Any insight here most welcome.	How late into infection would one test positive?

Possible mild case in February? Weird symptom	Just an interesting discovery after hearing others stories about this, in February i had about a week long period of a sudden onset of a metallic like taste in my mouth that would come and go when i would swallow or just drink water/eat and altered the way things tasted. The following weeks i had some GI issues that were spontaneous and would come and go. Two or so weeks after i had the metallic taste in my mouth my mom had a cold like illness as well as my boyfriend and his entire family. Its just weird to think that I could have had a mild case because it was so unexplainable as i wasnt taking any strange medications and I didnt have any teeth problems, i even asked my mom about it and she said she didnt know what could be causing it. so the taste was not explainable. Just something that I thought was notable- it could have been something or nothing its just very weird to think about.	Possible mild case in February?

Positive Test Today	As the title states I received my positive test results today. I started feeling clammy and a fever coming over me Tuesday evening. As the night progressed the fever got extremely high. I fought it through the night and forced myself to sweat it out in the morning. I went and got my test that same morning while holding a fever of 102 through that day, Wednesday. My fever broke down to 99 before going to sleep and has since stabilized. I have not had an elevated fever since that day. I feel fine all things considered besides mild congestion. I honestly just feel like I am coming off a cold. I had no breathing issues what so ever. I went to see a doctor as well to get a flu test which came back negative but she said my lungs sounded fine. Really all I want to know is what else can I expect from this? Have I had the worst or can this thing bounce back and make me ill again? What long term problems can I have? I am drinking a lot, taking vitamins, ibuprofen and resting.

Did I actually have COVID?	This might sound crazy, but I am not sure if I actually had corona. Yes, I had a positive test, but I never got any flu-like symptoms. The only symptoms that were corona related were my loss of smell and loss of some taste as well as respiratory symptoms. The thing that makes me question whether or not I had it is that I was in contact with 4 people very closely (sharing drinks and vape) and not one of them got it. They could have been asymptomatic but all of them? I also cried on my mom's shoulder and was a blubbering mess and she didn't get it. She has underlying health conditions and so does my dad. My dad said he could feel something trying to get him sick but barely. I am still recovering 19 weeks later. I am only 19 years old. I am obese but it hasn't affected my health at all so far. People with way worse underlying conditions than me and people way older have recovered in a very short amount of time. I am skeptical but I have no idea what else it could be.

Roommate is positive	My Roommate called me and told me he is positive and heading back to the apartment we live in (says he has no choice because his parents kicked him out after finding out), luckily I am out of town in a safe place and can stay here for a while, but he's put me in a very bad position. When will it be safe for me to enter the apartment again and what steps do I need to take now? Thank you.

15 m just tested positive for covid	Around Friday last week my mom started developing symptoms and isolated herself in her room. She got tested and was positive.a couple days ago I went to get tested and my results came back and I am positive. So far my only symptoms have been a stuffed nose, soar throat, and occasional headaches. I am very worried that my symptoms will worsen and that It could have a permanent effect on my lung. If someone has had a similar experience please tell me how it went.	15 m just tested positive for covid Around Friday last week my mom started developing symptoms and isolated herself in her room.

I have a Covid 19 question.	So my brother got a fever today and I hanged out with him yesterday. Now my mom is making come home from university and wait for my brothers results to come back. She's says I have to isolate myself in my and stuff which I'm fine with. However, she said that if my brother comes back positive I have to isolate myself for another 14 days. No testing for me or anything just isolation for 14 days. So basically my question is this necessary. Why don't I get tested too if my brother comes back positive and then isolate if my comes back positive. Idk, I just don't wanna miss out on my university experience and be away from everyone for another two weeks.	I have a Covid 19 question.

Mild case, but a long one, only discovered two days ago	Three weeks ago I got fever and went to covid center, PCR came negative and they let me go. Me, thinking I am certainly fine because they told me and my symptoms are just low grade fever (to 37.5) have treated it as common virus and my boyfriend came to see me. Terribly stupid, I know, but I was desperate. After two weeks of fever I went again, they scanned my lungs amd found pneumonia on the right. They gave me antibiotics but again let me go. As fever stays, I went and paid to do antibodies and so did my family. Turns out I have covid, and so does my brother who is completely asymptomatic. Dad is clear, mum is bordline with likeky climbing IgG, even though they live with my brother are are both chronic patients - the silver lining! It has been three weeks now, I still have fever up to 37.5. It goes by night but us very present during day. Plus I can't make myself a coffee without getting tired.

Covid 19 with no fever?	Hi everyone! I have been quarantined since 3/14 and I live in the greater Boston area. I work as an esthetician and one week ago (6/15) we had a back to work orientation where we went over guidelines and such. There was one woman who “doesn’t believe in wearing a mask” and had to asked to put one on and the kept repeatedly uncovering her nose. She was sat next to me, I was wearing a mask. On Saturday (6/20) in the evening I became extremely fatigued, lightheaded, body aches and having a hard time catching my breath. My thermometer was broken so not sure if I initially had a fever. I thought it was from the heat bc I’m very sensitive to hot temps. However all symptoms have continued including severe nausea, loss of appetite and now a small dry cough and some tightness feeling in my chest. The only symptom I don’t have is a fever (got a thermometer Monday 6/22). Has anyone been tested positive and didn’t have a fever at least at the beginning? I’m worried bc I’ll feel better for a couple hours and then it’ll hit me again and just wipe me out. My	Covid 19 with no fever? Hi everyone!

Was anyone else's cases like, super mild?	Hi all - sadly despite taking every precaution on earth, my girl and I contracted it.

Perhaps it's my age (34) but I'm just wondering how many of you had a similar progression.	Was anyone else's cases like, super mild?

I was laying in bed and my arm got tired holding up my phone. I took my tempature and it was 100.1 Thursday 7/2 - Slight stuffy nose and slight cough. Fever was gone.

Fiancé’s symptoms. So far anybody had a similar reaction? What can I expect next? At what point do I seek help?	Hello, I am taking care of my fiancé and she was tested and we are awaiting results. However I am 99% sure she will test positive. 27 year old female, not immunocimprimised but definitely has a weak immune system, she just seems to fight things slower than most people. She has felt fatigue and SOB throughout this whole thing. Day 1: woke up with fever and feeling achy with a headache. We got tested Day 2: Severe head pounding headaches that came in waves when her fever went up. Tylenol would help to decrease symptoms for a few hours but it would come back in another 4 to 5 hours. Day 3: Pretty similar to day 2 but the time between spikes was decreasing and fever was not as high. Day 4: Headaches are reducing further, but she still feels terrible overall. Then she starts to have achyness in her legs. Day 5: Woke up in the night with pretty severe aching in her legs. Keeps her from sleeping well. So that is where we are at right now.

Update on my dad. Almost 2 months on ventilator	My dad a covid patient has been on the ventilator for almost 2 months now. He got the tracheostomy about a month ago now and he still has not managed to get off the ventilator. He keeps having setbacks. Last night his lung partially collapsed and they had to stick a tube in. He will have that tube in him for at least 5 days I think. He is also over breathing the ventilator now, which I hear is very dangerous and can lead to more lung complications. He is negative for covid now, but it has done so much damage to him. The doctors don’t sound very concerned now, but to me it doesn’t look good. I just see him having more and more complications from here, but of course anything can happen and there is always some hope. I will keep praying. If he dies I know he had lived a good life, and he would want me to be strong.	Update on my dad.

A COVID-19 Infection Story for One, but Surprisingly not for a Few Others	"Hi all, I've been reading stories here for weeks now, and want to share a timeline story I find surprising, frustrating, and honestly hard to believe. &amp;#x200B; * July 4th: My roommates brother (I'll call him ""Vig"") was exposed to COVID-19 (We wouldn't learn this until later, but it's chronologically correct). * July 12: Vig hung out with me my roommate at our apartment. Vig, a server at a local restaurant, mentioned while he was at our apt that he was getting tested soon because he's been coughing a bit, and has slight loss of smell--which he attributed to smoking. (After hearing this I thought ""wtf"" why are you even over here then, but the three of us just hung out the rest of the night with no apprehensions). * July 12: It needs to be mentioned that Vig was in closer vicinity to my roommate and I than 6ft. I gave his some chips, which he took some and gave right back to me, he used my bathroom, and **we sat right next to one another on the couch for a two hour or so movie**. * July 13: My mother comes over to visit me, and spent the"	"A COVID-19 Infection Story for One, but Surprisingly not for a Few Others Hi all, I've been reading stories here for weeks now, and want to share a timeline story I find surprising, frustrating, and honestly hard to believe. &amp;#x200B; * July 4th: My roommates brother (I'll call him ""Vig"") was exposed to COVID-19 (We wouldn't learn this until later, but it's chronologically correct). * July 12: Vig hung out with me my roommate at our apartment.

So stupid	This is fucking stupid. Anyone who understands how viruses work and the 3 stages of it, will understand why self quarantine is stupid. Young people should literally be encouraged to go out and get the virus and then recover from it. Everyone thinks theyre a god damn scientist cause they watch the news. We need to start building immunity.	So stupid This is fucking stupid. Anyone who understands how viruses work and the 3 stages of it, will understand why self quarantine is stupid.

Two rapid negative tests but HORRIBLE Symptoms	"Hi everyone, My husband woke up Saturday morning feeling ""Hungover"" and couldn't finish his workout because he couldn't catch his breath. He decided to be proactive and get a rapid test which came out negative. That evening he started having horrible diarrhea and a low grade fever. He went to sleep and woke up at 1am with DRENCHED sheets, freezing, aches and a 103 fever. At 8am he woke up and went to another test place which AGAIN is negative. He is laying in bed with a high fever and headache now. He doesn't have diarrhea or shortness of breath anymore. &amp;#x200B; What gives??? Does he have COVID-19 or something else??"

Community Support, maybe a Discord?	Hello! I've been lurking on this server for a while, but I was wondering how many people would be interested in a Discord server? It might make it easier to share our stories, encourage each other, and have a support system. If there's enough interest I don't mind getting one started, just leave a message or DM me if this seems like something you'd be into. I feel strange saying this as a stranger, so I'd like to tell you all a bit about my experience. My mom was hospitalized for COVID on the 9th of April and she passed away on the 24th. It's been hell to come to terms with and I'm sure that a lot of you have similar stories. I tested positive on the 22nd but I'd been having symptoms develop around the same time that she did (we were quarantining and lived together.) It started off as a what felt like a sinus infection on the first day, slammed into me like a truck with breathing troubles and exhaustion. Lost my sense of smell, my sense of taste. Currently I'm feeling mostly alright, but occasionally I have days where I am just... **tired.** My breathing	Community Support, maybe a Discord? Hello!

After 50(??) days, my wife is recovered.	You can find links to more of our story in my post history. My whole family was presumed positive and my wife tested positive. It’s crazy to me that she was the only one of us who really got sick, but doctors say we’re all pretty much in the clear as of today. My wife had what they considered a severe case. She was hospitalized and on a ventilator. I wanted to write more about it, but I feel like I just... can’t. I want to forget it ever happened. I can’t explain how scared I was... how scared SHE was. When she came home, our toddler cried in a way that I don’t think I knew small children could cry. This was life changing for all of us. Thank you to those of you that checked in with me over the last several weeks. I wish I had more to say. I just wanted to give a positive update and let people know that even when things get really bad there’s still hope for recovery.	After 50(??) days, my wife is recovered.

COVID Anxiety	I didn’t know what flair to chose, i felt this one worked the best. Just a background on my symptoms- well, more like known symptom. I have had a cough for five days now, but it’s not like I’m coughing constantly. I’ll probably cough every few hours or so. My doctor said that it was probably a cold, but to get a test since I was out of state less than two weeks ago. So I took a test on Thursday and will hopefully receive results soon. Ever since I got this cough, my anxiety and depression have taken a hold on me. I have had some slight chest pain and soreness, but I’ve also started more weight lifting and strenuous work outs and have been sore. There are times where I feel like my breathing is off but those are the times where I can’t stop thinking about it I have it, or if I don’t. I’ve been looking through this subreddit hoping it would calm my anxieties but it backfired. It’s a constant thought nagging in my head, and makes me super nervous.

Questions about symptoms. Reading has me worried.	March 26: started with a small phlegm. Felt fine everywhere else March 27: the constant phlegm had gotten just a little worse. No cough just constantly trying to remove the phlegm. March 28: spent most of the day clearing phlegm. Still no sore throat or cough March 29: woke up with a slight tight chest and no taste or smell. Phlegm still there and still no cough or sore throat. March 30: tight chest. got slightly uncomfortable but nothing I couldn't handle. Still phlegm and still clearing my throat constantly. March 31: find myself constantly clearing my throat. Nothing too crazy but sometimes it feels a bit uncomfortable. My chest tightness is definitely noticable and it comes and goes. April 1: woke up with a tight chest and still constantly clearing my throat from this phlegm. Still no cough and still no sore throat. Around 11:20PM I felt as if I was running out of breathe for about a minute. Was laying down talking on the phone when I felt a little trouble breathing. Got up and started trying to breathe long and slow but felt weird. Went away in about 20 min and then put on my humidifier on	Questions about symptoms. Reading has me worried.

Positive but feeling great—safe to exercise?	Hey guys, 18M here, had a sore throat, cough, and runny nose for 3 days so went to get tested just in case and came out positive. During those three days (before I knew it was COVID) I was running, lifting, playing soccer etc. and felt fine. Only question—I feel fine but technically still have the virus. Is it a shitty idea to keep exercising? Quarantine has me stuck at home but we have a home gym so I won’t be going out or anything. Just love my exercise. Thanks!!

15 week update + eye exam	Well I think I may be finally starting to recover. Not feeling as tired these days and definitely less brain fog. Less chest congestion in the mornings too. I'm actually feeling pretty good these days despite high HR sometimes. Last Sat spent most of the day in 90F heat outside and even walked up my driveway with no sob. No relapse, no extreme fatigue. Today I went for an eye exam since my glasses broke and are hanging on by a thread. If I didn't have the virus before I definitely have it now. Big sign that said FEVER CHECK at the entrance but they skipped that and handed me a form and welcomed me aboard. Had to put my face and eyes on everything in the place. Doc was sneezing and coughing but thankfully masks were mandatory. I was the only one wearing gloves. TL;DR: I'm feeling good. Don't get an eye exam.	15 week update + eye exam Well I think I may be finally starting to recover. Not feeling as tired these days and definitely less brain fog.

Does continued exposure or highly concentrated exposure after you’ve already been infected make it worse?	Just wondering, if you think you’re already sick and you’re around other people who are sick and potentially get more of the virus from them, does that make it worse? Also, does it matter how much the initial amount of virus in your body is? Ie, being in a room where a bunch of sick people have been coughing?

Smell/Taste	My test was inconclusive and I retest in the morning. I have had sore throat, running and then bone dry nose / alternating, a cough, and body aches. This started for me on Thursday/Friday. I have lost my sense of taste of smell but its odd I can smell and taste somethings and others not at all. I usually have a super sniffer so it's very disconcerting and making me nuts because its like okay can I smell or can't I. Is anyone else like this?

How likely are false positives?	So i got tested on the 30th as a formality before surgery. I have no symptoms and have felt good overall. The test came back positive and i got tested again this morning. The doctor said an employee at their clinic got a false positive, tested positive then negative two days later. She said that this possibly could’ve happened to me too. Has anyone had any experience with a false positive?	How likely are false positives?

Tested Negative but have every symptom	So 7 days ago I started running a fever of 99.2-99.6. I had diarrhea, stomach cramping, and gas. Severe headache. Extreme physical fatigue. I got tested for covid on Saturday. I have been so weak I can barely stand for longer than 15 minutes without my legs trembling so badly I feel like I’ll collapse. My lungs are tight. I’m wheezy. I feel like shit. Test comes back today as negative. I’ve been quarantined for over 3 weeks. My only contact has been grocery delivery, two DoorDash deliveries, and my roommate who has not quarantined or social distanced at all. We have not physically touched but we share a kitchen. She says she does not have any symptoms. I also have chronic illness. Asthma, Crohn’s disease, cancer survivor, arthritis, fibromyalgia, to name a few. What the fuck else could I have gotten through touching shared items/groceries???? People already think I’m a hypochondriac even though they’ve seen my medical history. I hate not knowing. Has anyone had a negative test but they’re sure they have it?? TLDR: I have all the symptoms of covid. I’m chronically ill. My test came back negative. Wtf.

Positive followed by 3 negatives.	Tested positive on Monday 9/7, no symptoms, the group I traveled with all tested negative. Received the results on 9/11. Then, that day, I went and took a rapid and normal PCR test. Rapid was negative. Took another rapid test on Saturday 9/12, (required by work), negative. Received a PCR test from Friday today, negative. Still waiting on one more PCR. Has this happened to anyways? One positive followed by 3 negatives (2 rapid tests and 1 PCR). I know the PCR is the golden one and more sensitive of the two. Just want to hear your stories. I have been in quarantine BTW!	Positive followed by 3 negatives.

EVERYTHING TASTES AND SMELLS LIKE OIL	Ok super weird, but these past few days everything i eat that contains oil, smells so much like oil. I dont know if this is some weird after effect of covid. I tested positive almost three months ago, and lost my taste for a while. This past week, I would eat mcdonalds and all i could smell was the oil. The same thing happened with hot cheetos and so many other foods that were cooked with oil. And if i eat something that contains oil, I will smell it in my pee that day. Idk if my senses were altered or what is going on but its really strange.

Has anyone figured out anything about the whole not breathing issue while you sleep?	A week ago I woke up in the middle of the night, like I hadn't been breathing. I had to almost manually take the first breath, and I had a headache for a few minutes. It happened again last night 4 times. I managed to put my oximeter on after one of the episodes, and my O2 was 94 and went back to 100 in a few seconds. Now, it took like 15 seconds to get the thing on, and register a reading, so wtf was it before that? I read on here that a few people also experienced this. It's like I magically got sleep apena out of nowhere. 30 y/o male, no major health issues before this. I ate a lot of carbs yesterday, so I'm hoping that if I reduce my carbohydrate intake it'll go away. I've been carb cycling (high carbs day, 1 day, low carbs the next day) since this happened to drop fat but maintain some semblance of muscle mass, since I have not had a real workout in almost 3 months. I can't remember if I ate a lot of carbs on the previous days this happened. I'll report back.	Has anyone figured out anything about the whole not breathing issue while you sleep?

I hate myself because I can not provide for them even if I work 45 hours a week. I just want to cry.

Cost to test in NC?	My husband was tested on Wednesday and we just received positive results earlier today. He has health insurance and had to pay his normal copay which was $50. We have not quarantined from one another and I’ve been having symptoms but unfortunately I do not have health insurance. Does anyone here know about how much it would be? Not sure if there were free tests or if it varies by state or clinic since he had to pay.	Cost to test in NC? My husband was tested on Wednesday and we just received positive results earlier today.

Hypothermia?	I tested positive about a week ago. I would describe my symptoms as fairly mild. Extreme fatigue and complete loss of smell, 75%loss of taste. Mild cough. I have not had a fever above 99.8, and just for one day. BUT. I am a very active person usually, so I decided to go on a walk 2 days ago. I walked for about 1.5 hours, came back and sat down. Suddenly I felt very tired, confused and cold. I took my temp thinking I may have a fever. It read 93.2. I took it again (not drinking anything before you ask) and it read the same. My dad sanitized the thermometer and took his- Normal. Now back to me, 93.4. We put my under a heated blanket and wrote it off as a weird thing. Thing is, it happened AGAIN today. Anyone else having wild temp swings?	Hypothermia? I tested positive about a week ago. I would describe my symptoms as fairly mild. Extreme fatigue and complete loss of smell, 75%loss of taste.

Tested positive today	I was asymptomatic but got tested because the gf insisted. She was negative and I came back positive. I have no idea how long I have had it or where I got it.

IgM Positive still after 2 weeks, can this be possible?	Hello everyone, So basically i just traveled back to my hometown because my mother was sick and she needed surgery so i wanted to be with her in case something went wrong. Anyways the thing is that i didnt want my parents to get something so i was the one in charge to go and get all the medical results and so on(i think this is where i got it as i needed to go to the hospital several times), so fast forward and the day my mom got surgery i went to the hospital and they required a quick test and then IgM came positive. So i went back to my house directly and asked my brothers and parents to get tested and they came out negative, i stayed in my room for 2 weeks and then on saturday i went to get tested this time on a laboratory and then i received again the IgM positive and they told me that it shows as if the disease its starting but i never had any symptoms these past two weeks, nothing just a tickle on my throat for a day and that's it. The doctor told me to wait	IgM Positive still after 2 weeks, can this be possible?

So i went back to my house directly and asked my brothers and parents to get tested and they came out negative, i stayed in my room for 2 weeks and then on saturday i went to get tested this time on a laboratory and then i received again the IgM positive and they told me that it shows as if the disease its starting but i never had any symptoms these past two weeks, nothing just a tickle on my throat for a	1
Haven't been tested yet but wanted to know if anyone has matched my symptoms...	9 days ago I got a bad cough, wheezing had about 1 hour of shortness of breath during one of the days. I live in a country with air pollution so I thought it was from that, 5 days ago I started to get diarrhea and stomach cramp. During this time the cough and wheezing went away, and then yesterday I developed a 100 fever and felt like absolute garbage all day. Today I woke up and thought I felt great and then I started doing the dishes and cleaning up and realized I was very out of breath and light headed, my chest didnt really feel tight either I just felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen... I got kind of scared so I called my doctor who basically said just stay home (because I could still speak without too many pauses).... Right now I'm sitting in bed, i feel okay but im just so tired. Im not sure if this is corona, if the cough was corona, or if it started with the diarrhea so my question is Has anyone had similar timeline? Is shortness of breath without a cough normal?

covid is unstoppable	Folks, This virus is unreasonablly contagious. There is no way to put it. I tested positive last week. My curiosity and boredom backfired at me and literally weekend one of stepping out of quarantine I ended up getting it. Living in ornage county California , I can tell you that beaches, public places, restaurants, bars have never been more crowded. It's crazy how little people care about covid. Most of friends had not been in quarantine all year and called me out saying how nothing has hapnd to them all these months. I was cautious and did step out for workouts but avoided large gatherings and bars. After things reopened, I stepped out for a weekend. Looking at how packed at the public places were and people not even wearing masks, I thought I was over cautious. Few days later I tested positive. I was unlucky and experienced symptoms 4 days after. Day 1 - energy level low and slight body pain. Mild dry coughing. Ordered test kit that night. Day 2 - body ache is getting worse. Chills and mild cough. Getting feverish. Got tested. Day 3 - rough night with crazy sweating. Changed shirts 4 times. Bodyaches continue	covid is unstoppable Folks, This virus is unreasonablly contagious. There is no way to put it. I tested positive last week.

Did anybody get it out-of-the-blue?	Just curious, how many people were being responsible (mask, social distancing) but still got it anyway from an unknown source, such as by a random person sneezing on an apple at the supermarket before you walked in?

Isolated for 14 days because I thought I had it, no new symptoms and I'm going into the 15th day now	I thought I had covid so I isolated, I'm 17F, I dont work or go to school physically so it was easy just to stay home in my room. I thought I had it because of my sinuses being weird and my throat being slightly dry and sore when I would wake up in the morning. I stopped sleeping with my fan on, because I was told that can cause the sore dry feeling. My nasal passages are still slightly swollen, but my doctor says she thinks it allergies so she gave me a nasal spray and pills to take for it. I have been keeping track of my blood pressure, taking vitamin d3 and drinking as much water as I can. I've been taking vitamin d for about 2 months before this. The feeling would come and go, another nose feeling would just get worse when I'm laying in bed or in my room. I never had a fever, cough, congestion or felt like I had trouble breathing. My stepmom works at a hospital and she gets tested a lot, it's always come back negative.

Should I assume I’m positive?	I assumed I had Covid at the end of March, it was really strange because I didn’t have any of the ‘main’ symptoms, I have a huge fear of doctors and hospitals etc as I’m a diagnosed hypochondriac so just ‘going for a test’ isn’t as easy as you would think The symptoms I had back in March were just shortness of breath, nothing else , it lasted a few weeks. It went away but the past few days it’s come back! I have the following symptoms , on and off shortness of breath , chest pains on and off , aches on both sides of my body on and off. I have no fever or cough. Now I don’t know if maybe I was positive back then and it’s went away , and it’s just messed my body up , like maybe I wouldn’t even test positive now but if I had it back in March maybe it’s messed my body up Any reassurance would mean a lot and many any home remedies 😫😫 , I’m feeling very anxious 😟	Should I assume I’m positive?

Has anyone tested positive WITHOUT the presentation of the fever and shortness of breath symptoms?	I got tested yesterday just to be safe. My timeline: Sep 26- woke up with a scratchy/sore throat. A little stuffy/runny nose Day 2-4 same, with worsening sore throat, went to bed very early those days Days 5-8 felt better, except for a cough I can’t shake Day 9- woke up stuffy/runny again, slightly scratchy throat, still persistent cough. Got tested. Today I’m still just fighting with whatever is in my lungs that refuses to cough up. I am 99% sure it’s just a cold, but wondering what others have gone through, if similar.

Anyone else experiencing an intermittent fever for almost three weeks?	I tested positive last week after being sick since March 24 (tested March 28, results took 10 days, I’m in the US). I’m feeling better, my taste and smell is back, but this fever will not quit. My fever has been intermittent the whole time. Topped out at 101.5, and that was with Tylenol. Many days of jumping from normal to 101 and everything in between. I’ve twice gone 36 hours with nothing above 99, including the past two days until a few hours ago. Now at 100.6. I am so frustrated.

Be careful - What I thought was a relapse appears to have been reinfection.	"I posted on this thread recently about what I thought was a relapse, but now evidence strongly suggests to me it was a reinfection. Background: my husband and I had covid from late Feb through mid/late April (confirmed with a positive antibody test for my husband in early June. My antibody test was negative, but 100% I had it too: we were sick at the same time and my symptoms were classic, including painful deep breathing, continuing low-grade fever, bad headaches, changed sense of smell, etc). We were healthy from the end of April until June 12, when I experienced what I thought was a ""blip"". Based on comments on this thread, I assumed I was having a relapse (headaches again, low-grade fever, weird smell experiences). However, one week after my symptoms started, my husband also fell sick-- as bad as he was during our first infection. Given the circumstances of TWO people falling ill within one week of each other, I do not think it's likely we both had relapses coincidentally at the same time. More likely: Either I relapsed, became contagious and gave it to him, or I caught it somewhere and gave it to him.

Severe body aches?	Tuesday at work I started feeling my body ache like it hasn't before. I left work and came home. Driving home I had bad brain fog to the point of it being tough to maintain my lane. Get home, take a shower, and fall asleep from 5-7pm (I haven't napped since I was a kid). Wake up feeling just as bad, but with clogged ears. Body aches so much that walking hurts my ankles. Stomach is now torn up. No fever. Weds was the same. Woke up and went to work (I work essentially isolated from others). Still no fever or anything, but body is aching and heads foggy. Leave early again and go to the doctor. She wants me to get tested tomorrow if I don't feel better, and I feel worse..and now my wife's suffering from terrible head congestion. I'm going to get tested, but curious how bad everybody had the body ache. Mine is nearly unbearable and my doctor cleared me if everything except covid.	Severe body aches?

The said they will notify me when plasma gets in. Last Thursday he was awaken from sedation, Doctor said it would have to be done to try to wean him off as much as they can from the vent. He’s under pain meds so he’s comfortable. One concern is he hasn’t respond to any commands..he opens his eyes and blinks but they said he doesnt look at anyone when they talk to him, and doesnt respond with some type of movements.

Still he was responsible and decided not to hang out with us (we were a group of 4 friends). After this weekend, he told us he tested positive! We were all in shock and completely regret undermining the situation. Luckily he has very minor symptoms and says it just feels like a minor cold.

21M, Am I almost over it?

COV19 &amp; Mental Impact	Hey Everyone, I’m in the 55 day range since my first symptoms and so far, this week, I’ve been able to start running again. Pretty miserably out of shape and noticeably exhausted, but maybe I’m out of the woods? Anyway, had a pretty severe “mild case” as most of us seem to on this forum and I was wondering what percentage of people literally felt psychotic while Ill? As a preface, I DO have Bipolar, but I’m pretty self aware and do take medication. But while sick I was something/someone else entirely. I had a full on disconnected “episode” as I’d describe it if speaking of bipolar, but this just all together felt “wrong” - kind of like many, including myself, have described the body feeling of COVID. My fiancé also suffered similar mentally psychotic/personality shifting episodes throughout being sick. Again, it could be attributed to stress, anxiety and the prospective gamut. But the more I read, the more I see how interconnected our blood brain barrier is with this virus and how they’re finding all sorts of neurological impacts. How many of you could describe your mental status as an “episode” of sorts?

Doctors refused to test me here in TX, unless you have all symptoms they don't test you. I am almost certain I have it but they just said they won't test me unless I have a fever and cough, despite my week long shortness of breath, chills, stomach issues/diarrhea. Anyone have similar symptoms?	I've been feeling like shit for a week now, it started with noticable fatigue that turned into more fatigue with dizziness, increased heart rate, slight shortness of breath and chest tightness basically all the time. I'm waiting to get better but it's been a week now, and I don't think im going to get any help. My heart rate has gone from 63 avg, to 75+ avg this past week. I've been having minor stomach aches, body aches and all my stools are liquidy. I have never ever been sick like this or had something like this, but I've been quarantined for almost a week now, but after the next two days I won't be able to miss work anymore. Not sure what to do, I can't get a two week quarantine because the doctors won't test me, but I can't get tested because they don't think I'm positive.

99.5 Fever? Getting tested tomorrow	Hi all, thanks for all your posts they’re helpful and I hope you’re all doing well. I’ve been convincing myself what I’m feeling is just allergies (headache off and on for about a week, congestion) but last night I got achy and had diarrhea. I took my temp after that and it’s been steady in the 99 range, the highest being 99.5. Has anyone had really mild allergy like symptoms and tested positive? I have bad anxiety and not knowing is really hard. Thanks!	99.5 Fever? Getting tested tomorrow Hi all, thanks for all your posts they’re helpful and I hope you’re all doing well.

Obese person and Covid-19	Hi, I am a 29 year old unfortunately obese woman (BMI is 36 but used to be higher). My blood pressure is within normal range (found this out in February) and never had any issues with my lungs. Never had any serious physical health issues, only a broken ankle last year and the occasional chest infection. I live in Ireland and we are starting to cautiously open up again. We are down to daily cases under 30 and deaths under 10 per day. Most deaths are people over 70. But I am still so anxious that I will get this thing and die from it. I have pretty bad anxiety which doesn’t help. What are my chances of a serious case?	Obese person and Covid-19 Hi, I am a 29 year old unfortunately obese woman (BMI is 36 but used to be higher).

Confused about conditions to discontinue home isolation	Hi. 27 y/o, exposed to SARS-CoV-2 via one of my roommates who tested positive (who was likely exposed via community spread from a job in grocery). Came down with symptoms resembling COVID-19 starting March 31st, but did not test because of mildness of symptoms plus lack of preexisting conditions. I’m confused about the conditions required to discontinue home isolation. The CDC and CDPHE have implemented the following criteria... &gt;You have had no fever for at least 72 hours Check. Lacking a thermometer for the first week of the disease, I’m unsure if I ever had a fever to begin with. I never felt feverish, and by day 14 when we actually got a hold of a thermometer, I had a normal temperature (hovering around 97.6 degrees). &gt;Other symptoms have improved. So this is ambiguous as hell. Improved as in gotten better? Or improved as in resolved? If I still have *some* cough, I think it’s incredibly irresponsible to break home isolation while remaining symptomatic, especially the symptom most likely to spread the virus.

Has anyone experienced either of these: tinnitus, kidney problems	I tested positive at the start of March. Kidneys One of the things I noticed during my recovery was the insanely frequent urge to urinate. I’m prone to kidney/UT infections. It is likely my body trying to flush out the infection. It’s been over a month now and I’m still having this problem. I’m not drinking insane amounts of water (I tried that) or diuretics etc. Is anyone else struggling with this? Tinnitus/ear issues I have had ringing in my ears for the last 1.5 weeks. I know that tinnitus can be caused by upper resp tract infections. Has anyone had this as well?

Chest Pains: Anxiety or Covid?	How did the chest pains feel like and where did you feel it (sternum, etc)? Was it a sharp pain when you move or constant? Is your heartbeat fast? I think I’m just being anxious and it maybe not be covid-19. I do have an occasional cough to clear what feels like a tickle or scratch around my throat. I do have sore throat as well from March 10 until now.	Chest Pains: Anxiety or Covid? How did the chest pains feel like and where did you feel it (sternum, etc)?

Persisting heart palpitations and tachyardia. Have been checked out by a cardiologist who couldn't find anything wrong with my heart. Resting heart rate at 95-100, goes up to 140 just by standing up. Anyone else?	I've been sick since March in what is probably covid, and something thats been coming on in the last couple of week is a fast heart rate and heart palpitations. A couple of days ago I couldn't take it anymore and went to the ER. I was directly referred to the cardiology unit and they did a lot of tests. Ultra sound, CT scan ECG, 24 hour ECG for several days and couldn't find anything. They also did lots of tests on my blood work and everything looks fine. I had slightly elevated white blood cells but they have since come down to a normal rate. They did a test where they measured my blood pressure and pulse when I was lying down and then when I was standing up for 10 minutes. My bp lying down was 120/95 and pulse was 100. Standing up my bp went down to 80/60 and my pulse went up to 140. I wasn't doing anything physically, just standing up. The doctors said they didn't find anything and thinks it's a rest symptom from covid so I was sent home and will go back in a month to do a follow up.

Anyone else make this mistake?	So after over a week or so of finally feeling like a million bucks, after my symptoms began on June 13th, I decided to drink alcohol on the 4th of July. It hit me harder than usual but I just assumed it was because I hadn’t had any alcohol in a very long time, but after a bad hangover it seems that a good bit of my symptoms have relapsed. I have a bit of a cough as well as extreme fatigue and possible shortness of breath, although this could be my anxiety (I have no idea how to tell the difference but I keep yawning just to get more air in.) I wanted to know if anyone has had relapsed symptoms after drinking alcohol or even just after a few weeks of feeling better. I need words of comfort, I was idiotic for drinking at all but I had been feeling normal for a while. I’m 22F and seemed to fight the virus fairly easily the first time around. EVERYONE STAY AWAY FROM ALCOHOL, TAKE IT FROM ME!	Anyone else make this mistake?

Am I Still Contagious?	Hello, I am new to reddit so I apologize if this post is out of place... So I (18F) have had Covid symptoms (fatigue, fever, SOB, chest pain/tightness, mild GI, headache, sore throat, ect) going on 7.5 weeks now. At Day 26 I had two tests done and they were both negative, however, given the time it took to get tested and my symptoms my doctor still assumes I am/was positive and no longer “shedding the virus”. A few days after I was tested, I started to improve. It was up and down for a bit but the last several days I have maintained moderate fatigue and a low grade fever. I know that recovery can take a long time but here’s the question: Am I contagious???? CDC guidelines don’t clarify for my situation and i’m not sure what to do. (ie two neg tests, but with persisting (reduced) symptoms) I feel like I have to start to return to life (I have an important class starting next week) but I obviously wouldn’t put others in danger of getting sick. I am so conflicted.	Am I Still Contagious? Hello, I am new to reddit so I apologize if this post is out of place...

I'm in recovery!	Hello! I just wanted to talk about my experience with Covid-19 as I basically didn't have the extreme symptoms like most people. I am 29, female, live in the USA. No health conditions besides allergies and mild asthma. Ok so! I started feeling symptoms on June 22nd: mostly just my heart was racing randomly, I felt pretty tired after just roller skating for like 2 hours. (yes outside but I had my face covering on). Tuesday, June 23rd: I woke up with an extremely bad headache and my neck was in so much pain but I took ibuprofen and all symptoms went away. Wednesday, June 24th- Sunday, June 28th: I had a headache, nasal congestion but with no mucus, super fatigued (took two naps a day), my mouth was so dry I drank so much water but I couldn't quench my thirst, and I stayed home this entire time and was away from others. On Sunday, I woke up with extreme vertigo and all I could do was lay down and sleep because I had extreme nausea as well. I made an appointment and got tested on 6/30, got results 7/2 and I came up positive. I took the nasal	I'm in recovery! Hello!

Chest tightness with no shortness of breath? Am I crazy?	I tested positive for Covid 2 days ago. My first symptoms were a scratchy throat and an achy, tired feeling. Other than a headache, my symptoms are: sore throat, fatigue, mild congestion, headache. But here's the kicker: my chest has felt tight and sometimes burns. I'm making myself nuts trying to decide if it's going to my lungs or not. My pulse ox is consistently beautiful: 98, 99, 100. I've not felt SOB or air hunger. I'm not coughing. I did a telehealth with my doctor and they theorized that it's either anxiety or inflammation. So, I'm looking for experiences/reassurance/thoughts: has anyone experienced this with a positive Covid? I'm really really good at working myself into a frenzy of worry, so anxiety is a possibility. But I don't want to write off a symptom. I've been googling this for 2 solid days. Please help ease my mind!	Chest tightness with no shortness of breath? Am I crazy? I tested positive for Covid 2 days ago. My first symptoms were a scratchy throat and an achy, tired feeling.

Scared I may have caught it from a runner outside, need to ask some questions.	"I foolishly entered what is called the ""slipstream"" of a woman who approached me suddenly while she was running. I wasn't thinking. I moved out of her way then got back up on the sidewalk where she had been running. I had a mask on, but I know that doesn't mean shit. Now I'm scared I could have been infected by breathing in her droplets. I just need some reassurance here, I know I was stupid. She just came out of nowhere and I wasn't thinking to get out of the way of where she had been. Ugh!"	"Scared I may have caught it from a runner outside, need to ask some questions.

They prescribed me anti nausea medicine that i’ve been taking since last Wednesday and i’ve been able to keep things down but i’ve started getting pain in my back and random pain in my stomach and lungs? idk if its anxiety but i think i’m able to breathe right but sometimes it hurts. I’m on day 8/9 of showing symptoms can anyone tell me if they think I will get worse? or if i will begin to recover? Some other minor symptoms like ringing ears and dizziness have gotten better in the past two days. Someone please help me.

Likelihood of getting COVID while eating?	Whenever I visit anyone outside my household, I always wear a mask. I like to think that it offers me some protection, which is better than nothing. My cousin's wife just invited me to Thanksgiving dinner and I don't know what to do. She always tells me that they don't have COVID and that they wear a mask when they go out. BUT, I know that they don't wear a mask around friends and clients, and vice versa. Even though she knows it can be spread asymptomatically, she doesn't seem to be intelligent enough to understand that her friends and clients can infect her. Also, her family reuses the same mask. She keeps hers in her purse. I'm afraid that I'll catch it during that 15-30 min. of actually eating dinner. I've considered taking my plate and just sitting in a chair 6 ft. away from the table. It'll likely just be her and one other person at the table as the other two eat at the computer in other rooms. However, the one person is elderly and is prone to choking and coughing fits at the table. I would've turned down the invitation except I feel I should go	Likelihood of getting COVID while eating?

Have you experienced brain fog and bouts of diarrhea mixed with constipation?	Starting on 9/14 I woke up with a bad headache. Assumed it was from lack of caffeine as I’m a daily drinker. Progressed throughout the week to a migraine that eventually subsided. Now it feels like a bad head cold. During this time, I experienced constipation. I am a very regulated individual and assumed I was lacking fiber. Drank some prune juice and it cleared me right out. Next several days though were filled with extreme diarrhea. Like never before. This entire time I’ve experienced a brain fog that I can’t shake. I wake up and feel hung over 24/7 and I’ve been napping too. I’ve never napped in my life. Always just a 8 hr sleeper. I can’t make it to lunch before I’m completely fatigued. The brain fog keeps me from doing anything productive and I feel a slight pressure from my chin to my cheeks to my forehead. Almost like a sinus infection but like I said, more like a hangover. Anyone experience this? I tested negative yesterday after waiting a day for my results.

Positive	I am a CNA before were permitted to enter the facility, the nurse takes our temp. No temp means were covid-19 free. Well thats bull.

Loss of appetite long-term after covid? Rollercoaster recovery!	I had COVID the first two weeks of May. Fever, body aches, couldn’t leave my bed. I’d say it was a moderate case. Nothing severe. When I was sick I had a complete loss of taste and smell, and I never felt satisfied, so I couldn’t stop eating! Once recovered, I felt fine. But now I keep getting these waves of sudden diarrhea, scent hallucinations, and total loss of appetite. Food is so repulsive I have to force myself to eat. But what’s strange is I did not have these symptoms when I was sick! It’s been months and these *seem to be* my only symptoms, but I’m confused why they come and go. I’ve had a positive antibody test and two negative swab tests since recovering. Waiting on results of a third swab test. Anyone have any advice or experience something similar? This recovery feels like a roller coaster, but I’m really worried about shedding the virus and putting others at risk!	Loss of appetite long-term after covid? Rollercoaster recovery! I had COVID the first two weeks of May. Fever, body aches, couldn’t leave my bed. I’d say it was a moderate case. Nothing severe. When I was sick I had a complete loss of taste and smell, and I never felt satisfied, so I couldn’t stop eating! Once recovered, I felt fine. But now I keep getting these waves of sudden diarrhea, scent hallucinations, and total loss of appetite. Food is so repulsive I have to force myself to eat. But what’s strange is I did not have these symptoms when I was sick! It’s been months and these *seem to be* my only symptoms, but I’m confused why they come and go. I’ve had a positive antibody test and two negative swab tests since recovering. Waiting on results of a third swab test. Anyone have any advice or experience something similar? This recovery feels like a roller coaster, but I’m really worried about shedding the virus and putting others at risk!	2
POTS Anyone?	Presumed to have contracted in January before we knew it was a thing. Misdiagnosed, been through hell since. Anyway, now I have POTS? What fresh hell is this? I am dead tired even on Dextroamphetamine! If I get up too fast my vision is blurry and the room goes black for a bit until it passes. Then I have to sit down for awhile. My heart rate is elevated even laying down. It jumps when I sit or stand up. Low on all my lab work and glucose. I thought my last ER visit for the diagnosis of Costocondritis was it and now since then I have POTS too? I’m ready to get off this ride now. It’s like the gift that keeps on giving. The greatest part is doctors believe it’s too late for me to have an antibody test so I may never know 🤪 Love and health to all. ❤️	POTS Anyone?

Just wondering	Just wondering Hi, I don’t know if I ever had covid. I came into contact with my sister an hour after she came into contact with someone who had it. Not sure if an hour will cause her to already be contagious but if so.. I never had any symptoms only a small amount of stuffiness in my nose. Today is day 14 since I could have possibly been exposed, but now a weird feeling in my neck and down to my shoulders and a small area on my chest are feeling like I put vicks on. If it is from covid is this usually at the end of the sickness ? And does anyone think I could have been exposed being that my sister was only exposed for the first time shortly before she saw me.?

Negative tests - when is it safe?	Hi everyone, My partner came down with what seemed like a sinus infection last week so I kind of panicked a bit and made him quarantine away in the house. We all got tested and me and him were negative (my daughter's results haven't come back yet but she has zero symptoms). I'm aware false negatives can happen so I'm a little wary. His sinus infection symptoms have almost abated. When do you think it's safe to be around each other again?	Negative tests - when is it safe?

Anyone with unusual breath?	Finishing up day 8 since symptom onset. I've noticed a very specific smell to my breath that is somewhere been woody / tobacco / hamster bedding / medical smelling.

I tested positive today, here are some details	(Some key background info: I am a 20 year old male, with no underlying conditions and a very solid immune system, I rarely ever get sick, maybe once every year or so, and when I do, I'm 100% in about 2-3 days) Hi all: I tested positive for COVID-19 today and I was hoping to share some of my experiences thus-far and hopefully bring hope to some people that have either caught it already or are afraid they might. I came into contact with someone who I didn't know had COVID at the time, which was on Sunday, 6/7, and I developed symptoms Wednesday, 6/10 at night, where I developed a fever. This was the first night and it was kind of rough, fever peaked around mid night at around 103.6, but oh well, I wasn't taking medication because I just wanted to get over it naturally. Next day, 6/11, woke up with a lessened fever and a headache but was luckily feeling better. 6/12, I woke up finally with no fever and just massive headache and minor stuffiness but was manageable, it was finally on this day that I decided to take some mucinex for the stuffiness and some	I tested positive today, here are some details (Some key background info: I am a 20 year old male, with no underlying conditions and a very solid immune system, I rarely ever get sick, maybe once every year or so, and when I do, I'm 100% in about 2-3 days) Hi all: I tested positive for COVID-19 today and I was hoping to share some of my experiences thus-far and hopefully bring hope to some people that have either caught it already or are afraid they might.

Am I actually sick? Should I be tested? 31F/CA	Hey guys, I hope this the right formatting for this kind of question/post. I’m a 31F (5’5, 120 pounds) in Southern California, pretty healthy overall. I do have a neurological issue that’s totally unrelated. This morning I had an unrelated doctors appointment (primary care). I had a slight fever but no one at the office brought it up, it didn’t seem important. I run a little under normal, so they probably didn’t think anything of it. Got home a few hours later and as the day wears on I have a throbbing headache, my body hurts (mostly my legs) and a very mild temperature (99.8). My ears are starting to irritate me a bit. Now my throat doesn’t exactly hurt, it’s not scratchy per se, but it’s becoming very difficult to swallow, it almost fills.. full? I hadn’t noticed much in the way of symptoms yesterday. I was a bit sore, for no notable reason and very lazy and tired, I didn’t even really get out of bed. This is very unlike me. After reading some posts here, I can’t for the life of me think of where I’d be exposed. I work from home during the week (since March)	Am I actually sick?

Do you get better, really?	I haven’t been officially diagnosed... but I travelled in early March - which is when I think I contracted it. I’ll feel better, and then It gets worse. I fight it, but it really hangs on. My biggest concern is starting to be that this virus is like herpes. Has anyone here completely gotten over it?	Do you get better, really?

Getting tested tomorrow	I’ve been having this weird feeling in my trachea? It’s at the indent, under your Adam’s apple, and it feels inflamed almost. No cough, no fever. I’ve been quarantining this whole time but my brother works with someone who tested positive. I am 29 male and a smoker, starting to freak out. I have this feeling like I need to clear my throat, but like I said, no cough. Just asking to see if anyone had the same problem. Breathings fine along with everything else Thanks guys	Getting tested tomorrow I’ve been having this weird feeling in my trachea?

Wife and I got tested. Hers was positive and mine was negative	My wife started showing symptoms on 6/26. Mild cough and fatigue. I had a mild fever on 6/29 and body aches. We both got tested on 7/3. She got her results on 7/10 which were positive, and i just got mine an hour ago saying I was negative. Mind you she lost taste and smell on 6/29 and I lost mine on 7/4. Could it be that i got the virus before her but symptoms took longer to show which is why i got the negative results? If so, would it be possible to loose smell and taste after the initial 14 days? Should we both test for antibodies and get teated again?	Wife and I got tested. Hers was positive and mine was negative My wife started showing symptoms on 6/26. Mild cough and fatigue.

Tightness of Chest w/ Negative Test	Hi all, Just stumbled upon this subreddit, I hope my formatting is correct. Starting Tuesday, one of my roommates and I both began to experience symptoms, though his were rather severe. Throwing up, 102 fever, etc. I had a headache and body fatigue through Thursday. We had the same exposure, and 4 people we were with on Friday ended up testing positive. We both got tested on Wednesday through our university, and got our results Thursday. He tested positive, I tested negative. Starting Thursday at like 6pm, my chest began to get tight. By this time the headache was gone, and body aches were also diminishing. Today, (Friday) I was awoken rather early in the morning from my chest feeling sore/tight, and the only fix was to lie on my back, rather than my side. As the day has progressed, the tightness seems to come and go, never fully disappearing, but increasing and decreasing in strength. Other than that I feel totally normal. I have no difficulty breathing, no cough, no lost sense of taste or smell, and can still take deep breathes as normal. I guess I am posting this to ask if I should be concerned.

Can I take antibiotics while having long covid?	I'm very concerned about interactions between my body while having long covid/reactivating symptoms and anything I may take medicinally. I have a possible ear infection/ear issue and was prescribed amox-clav and ciproflox-dexameth. Are there any concerns I should have? I asked the person who prescribed it to me but because of how foreign long covid is to a lot of medical workers he presumed I just meant regular covid which he dismissed me from having due to my normal temperature.

COVID Symptoms for One Day?	It’s been a few weeks now after isolating as a precaution but I’m wondering if anyone who tested positive had the experience I did. For the most part my symptoms were isolated to 24 hours. It started with abdominal pain in the morning, the sort where you know something is wrong but not so painful to cause nausea. The abdominal pain got better as the day went on but was replaced by this general fatigue so I decided to take a nap in the afternoon. I woke up with intense painful aches and felt warm. I took my temperature and had a low grade fever that within an hour rose to 101 Fahrenheit. Felt pretty feverish for a couple hours so I decided to hydrate and go to bed. I woke up the next morning drenched in sweat and with a headache but generally feeling better. I had this slight pain in my chest almost like acid reflux near my sternum for a couple days but nothing else and it would generally come and go. I live in a major city with a sizable outbreak and was taking public transit (pre-stay at home order) up until two days before my	COVID Symptoms for One Day?

Day 6 or 7	Hi my girlfriend and I tested positive for COVID recently and we are here to share our experience and get any advice from people who have had similar experiences. We are two 22 year olds who live pretty healthy lifestyles. I am a strength coach and I typically eat a fair amount of fruits and vegetables, and enough protein, carbs, and fats from good sources to feed a small village. I exercise 3-5 times a week. My girlfriend doesn’t eat as well/much as me, but by all means she doesn’t eat bad. She exercises 1-3 times a week. We never drink (only on birthdays or in Mexico) and the worst thing we do is smoke a little pot. I smoke very small amounts 2-3 times a week to help me eat and sleep, and once or twice a week I’ll actually smoke a whole joint or blunt. She may take 1-2 hits of however I am partaking 2-3 times a week. Here’s our timeline Wednesday she felt extra run down when we were working out that afternoon. I started to feel rundown that night while cooking dinner. Checked our temperatures and we were both below 98.6.

Antibody Test Question	Hello - Wondering if there's anyone familiar with the COVID Rapid Antibody Tests. I know there's still a lot of questions out there, but maybe someone has some insight. I was sick from about March 19th thru March 22nd with some cold like symptoms. My partner became ill about 10 days prior with the same, although more pronounced, illness. I also had a bad cold/flu/something in mid-January. But, after March, neither of us had any cold symptoms. We didn't take tests at that time because of availability (although my partner did a Telehealth appointment and it was their opinion he didn't have it). Anyhow, I saw that my local urgent care is offering RayBiotech COVID Rapid Antibody tests. I took the test April 27th and it came back positive but only for the IgM antibody. The PA mentioned the COVID episode was likely the latter illness in March since I'd probably produce IgG antibodies if I was ill before that. Today, my partner took the same test and also only tested positive for the IgM antibody. Based on the paperwork, IgM is visible after 5-14 days and IgG is produced 3-5 days after that. It seems odd that IgG would	Antibody Test Question Hello - Wondering if there's anyone familiar with the COVID Rapid Antibody Tests.

Mild Headaches and Mild Lightheadedness - Tested Negative 23 days ago	Hi Everyone, I tested positive on August 13, 2020, and my symptoms were not too bad until August 17th where I was extremely light-headed and ended up going to the hospital where I was admitted and given Remdesivir for 5 days. I was released from the hospital on August 23, 2020, and tested Negative on August 24, 2020. I took 2 more tests and tested Negative with gaps of 48 hours and 1 week. I also took an antibody test which came positive for IGG and not IGM. It's been 23 days since my first negative test and my lightheadedness is still present but it seems slightly less and my headaches are more random and not as painful as before. I also get a weird feeling watching TV and using my cell phone if the scene is shakey or choppy. I don't get dizzy where the rooms spin just makes me feel weird like something is wrong. I do get brain fog but that is random at times but again that also seems to be less than before. Did anyone else experience the same thing and gradually get back to 100%?

Doctors just now starting to see people where I am. Have apt with a new GP tomorrow (didn’t have one) for fist time. Had chest X-ray and ecg on day 10. Only phone stuff since, and doctor says stay home and don’t go to doctors office. Was thinking maybe I need cardiologist, pulmonologist or hematologist? Trying to avoid seeing a million of doctors as I’m pretty nervous to go. ER by me prob not an option cause symptoms not bad enough.	What type of specialist to see?

Hot tip: Stay away from coffee (and presumably any caffeine)	On the tail end of my infection, only dealing with the occasional shortness of breath now.

Cold or Covid?	As someone who deals with lots of anxiety, I need some help determining if what I have is just a cold or something else. Day 1-2: I had a sore throat...not super painful but definitely noticeable. Day 3: sore throat is gone, but is replaced by congestion in nose and lungs. Chest hurts when I cough, and I have a fever that fluctuates between 99.5-100.5. I had the most chills on this day. Day 4: no more pain in my chest, fever goes down to a steady 99.5, still congested. Day 5: temp down to 99.3, still congested but not as much. Normally, I would assume this is just a cold. I’ve had colds before that have shown these symptoms in this order, but obviously with Covid you can’t be too sure. Send help?	Cold or Covid?

Do some people have innate immunity?	My partner and I recently visited my parents who live with my sister. Whilst we were there my sister started coughing. A few days later, she tested positive for coronavirus, and she had passed it on to me, my partner, and my dad (all ended up being mild). My mum had no symptoms, and also tested negative. It has now been over 14 days since my sister first showed symptoms, so it’s very unlikely that she’s pre-symptomatic. How is it possible that my mum avoided getting it, when she lives with my dad and sister who are (or at least were) both positive? I mean, my partner and I both caught it from a fairly brief visit right at the start of my dad and sisters’ illness, and my mum has been up-close-and-personal with them throughout the whole thing. Has anyone else had an experience like this? I guess the options are: 1. My mum already had it a while ago and was asymptomatic (but somehow didn’t pass it on to anyone back then). 2. My mum caught it, was asymptomatic, and the test was a false negative. 3. By some miracle my mum didn’t come into contact with the	Do some people have innate immunity?

Do I have bronchitis or Coronavirus?	Got a sore throat/congested nose with sneezing on Monday. Developed a cough as well. Runny nose has gone on all week and seems to have ended today. Cough remains rampant with chest pains here and there with difficulty breathing. If I lay down on my back or on my side I tend to wheeze while breathing out. I haven’t developed a fever but the only thing bugging me has been the shortness of breath. If I go outside for a walk it seems to calm down a bit as well.

In the clear?	I’ll start off by saying I had a test that was negative and two doctors have decided it was likely a false negative. I got sick initially March 15th and was sick until the 24th. I had a 6 day rebound and fell ill again. I’ve been sick since the 30th. My O2 is good but my chest feels very tight and I’ve been having lots of abdominal pain and overall wooziness. If I’m okay riding it out, then great, but I’m scared I’m going to turn critical at any moment. My overall symptoms have included pink eye, GI upset, burning chest, burning lungs, fatigue, dizziness, loss of taste and smell. No significant cough. Went to the hospital 4/6 and had a chest X-ray and CAT scan that were both clear. Labs came back fine, just dehydrated. Does anyone have experience with being 4.5 weeks into the game and needing to go to the hospital? I’m terrified that I’m going to get really bad really quickly even though most of what I’ve read seems to get the worst in the first 2-3 weeks. I’m 30F, weigh 130lbs and have lupus.

Has anyone had issues returning to a physical/active job?	I tested positive about a month ago and did my whole 2 week quarantine and was released to go back to work. I had a pretty mild case with cough and fatigue being my worse symptoms. However since recovering, like a lot of people, I’m not back to my usual self. I have a pretty physical job where I do a lot of lifting, standing for hours at a time and kneeling and I am having a difficult time doing my job. It seems about 1/3 of the days I feel great and the others like I’m walking around carrying a 40 lb bag on my shoulders and on the verge of passing out from exhaustion. And I also get random chest pains and have a higher than usual heart rate making it more difficult to breathe. I’m tired of feeling like this and am not sure if talking to a doctor is even worth it because this seems to just be a normal thing people recovering experience.

Dad tested positive, mom probably has it too, I have questions about how to handle this	Greetings everyone. I live at home with my parents. My mom and dad are both in their 50s and diabetic; my dad has high blood pressure and my mom has a history of respiratory issues. I'm 21 but have no health conditions beyond the fact that my sinuses are messed up. My dad started feeling sick Tuesday; he had headaches and a fever and was sweating a lot. Lost his sense of taste and smell. Slight cough. As of today, he no longer has a fever and feels more or less back to normal, but still has a cough/clears his throat often. Got tested Wednesday; test came back today. He told me to avoid him on Tuesday morning so I have been doing that. I don't know when my mom started feeling unwell but as of today she's definitely not doing great. I heard her saying to people on the phone that she's having back pain and her ears hurt; I think she has a fever. She does have a cough. I'm particularly worried about my mom because she has a history of asthma on top of diabetes.

BPD, and Covid isolated away from everyone	My fiancé is quarantined in a hotel with his daughter. I booked them a hotel when I started feeling sick, just in case. Due to custody arrangements, I hadn’t seen her for 2 weeks so it was important to keep her out of the house as soon as I felt sick. I had been like massive deep cleaning the day before so I though I just kicked up a lot of dust. When I got tested, it was positive. So now we wait for their results in 2-3 days. If both are negative they stay in the hotel a week and she goes home to moms. If either are positive they both come home. This sucks. I have BPD and being isolated alone and sick is so hard. I’m just sobbing. I don’t know how to cope.	BPD, and Covid isolated away from everyone My fiancé is quarantined in a hotel with his daughter.

Is anyone positive but their diarrhea symptom only lasted for a short bit?	I’m a 20F and I had a diarrhea yesterday assuming it was the mac and cheese I ate because I’m lactose intolerant. I had read on this thread that some people who tested positive had diarrhea lasting multiple days before more symptoms appeared. My diarrhea only lasted one trip to the bathroom however the next day I wasn’t feeling all too hungry which was unusual. I also had some burping and stomach movements. So my question is, is there anyone who tested positive for COVID-19 but their diarrhea symptom was super short? not lasting more than a day. If so can you describe your experience? It could possibly be my lactose intolerance but my brother had diarrhea today as well (he’s an essential worker). Just being cautious as I’m incredibly paranoid during these troubling times. i’ve also been at home all of the time taking once a week walks	Is anyone positive but their diarrhea symptom only lasted for a short bit?

Could this be covid? I'm on the verge of a panic attack	19/F. Sorry if this sounds incoherent, English is not my first language, and I'm in a quite bad state of mind right now. I really don't know what to do. I noticed that my sense of smell was a bit weaker in the mornings right after I woke up-but it's been this way since I started observing it like a month ago. It always lasted for like 15 minutes, and was still alright, never completely lost. I even read that sense of smell was a bit worse for everyone in the early hours, so I didn't think much about it. Shit like congestion and sore throat is something I've been dealing with on and off for almost 2 months, so even that is nothing new. My throat ache is mostly resembles GERD symptoms-a burning sensation at the bottom of my throat, mainly when I'm laying down. However, on Sunday (that's when I started checking my smell in a more paranoid way) I noticed that during the day, there was a time when my sense of smell wasn't that sharp.

Kissed a coworker	Hello! So I stay in my office 5 days a week thanks to covid along with my co-workers, one day I kinda got a fever but it wasnt that high didn't even reach 38°. I was laying on my bed when suddenly my coworker laid beside me and teased me on kissing her, we eventually kissed. We were all scheduled for a swab test 4 days later and I tested positive... but she didn't. I'm happy that she didn't get the virus but how come she didn't tested positive since we exchanged saliva and all. That's all I guess. Thanks for reading.	Kissed a coworker Hello!

Grandmother, 80 recovered	Hi all, I thought it might offer some hope to people whose grandparents/parents have tested positive. My grandmother is 80 and not the most healthy person. She is quite overweight and very inactive, she uses a walking frame to walk around although doesn't have any heart issues or diabetes afaik. Around 6 weeks ago, she came down with what seemed like a regular flu (baring in mind that the published symptoms of coronavirus have developed over time). She had headache, blocked sinuses and a fever but only a mild occasional cough and no breathing difficulties. Thinking back, she did also complain that the food she was having tasted bad, which could be related to loss of taste people are experiencing but we didn't make that connection at the time. After 2 weeks, she was still struggling so we were able to get her seen by a paramedic, she tested positive for covid-19 and was taken to hospital as I believe she had low oxygen levels. In hospital, she was given oxygen via a mask for a day, then via nose tubes for a week or so as well as a round of antibiotics. I'm not certain what the antibiotics were	Grandmother, 80 recovered Hi all, I thought it might offer some hope to people whose grandparents/parents have tested positive.

The weirdest sweats - getting hot too quickly?	One of my (32, M) main and first symptoms throughout this have been extreme sweats as a result of (even mental) exertion. For example, I had a pretty relaxed zoom meeting for work yesterday and was soaking wet afterwards. Another example was when I had to pick up a parcel in the lobby of our building (a 50 steps walk). It seems like I heat up way too fast, when just a little bit of adrenaline hits my body. I'm usually not a big sweater, so am pretty surprised by this. This symptom went away after week 3 but I got it back in my recent relapse (week 6). Does anybody else have this? And did you perhaps find something that helps?

Hypertension success stories?	"Hi, 16F here. Yesterday evening I began developing symptoms that include a blocked and itchy nose, itchy eyes, and muscle pain. I've done everything ""right"" but I know everyone makes unconscious mistakes. I live in a relatively small house with just one bathroom. My father (49, 50 this month) suffers from treated hypertension, as well as being overweight, but does exercise frequently, and I'm so afraid that I will spread it to him, although likely I already have, as we went out for a car drive on father's day, yesterday. Does anyone have any success stories about beating this with hypertension? I'm staying away from my family now but I'm worried its too little too late and that the rest of them catching this is inevitabile."	"Hypertension success stories? Hi, 16F here.

Fatigue nausea and overheating after an active day	Has anyone felt extremely fatigued, nauseous and overheated a day after being active outside? Today I couldn’t get up and walk around without feeling even the slightest bit of nausea and fatigue. I also overheated fairly quickly and couldn’t stand to be in a room temp environment. So I resorted to laying in bed with a fan blasting in my face to feel even the slightest bit back to normal. Is this allergies or something more? Random symptoms come in waves but today’s symptoms were a bit strong. Did anyone who tested positive have any difficulty’s regulating body temperature, etc?

Advice for those Living Alone	Has anyone that tested positive lived by themselves? I do, and I keep seeing stories of people being told to stay home unless they can't breathe, and I'm not sure how I'd communicate to emergency services if that were the case.

I'm not at risk, nor have I been exposed more than the essential grocery trip, but I'd like to have a plan for if shit hits the fan.

Presumed positive test results are now delayed	How long have your tests taken to get back to you? Been sick and isolated for over a week with my wife and kids, took the test on March 16 in California. Still no results, I was told 3 days. I feel like I’m bugging the ER at this point calling them once a day. Presumed positive for Covid after coming back from a cruise. sore throat, chest tightness, hard to breath, choking cough every minute, white chunky stuff, used to be green. Currently taking prednisone as my latest prescription, this seemed to help a bit more with the shortness of breath, as I feel like I can fill my lungs more without going into a coughing fit. I took a zpack (Zithromax) on Monday. I have albuterol due to a lung sensitivity that I’ve been using and that seems to help only slightly. After reading some of these posts, it’s all over the place for people that have tested positive.	Presumed positive test results are now delayed How long have your tests taken to get back to you?

Anxiety and covid 19	If you are struggling with covid-19, the best thing to do is to stop thinking about it. I would ruminate and go on reddit, read news, worry of the chest tightness was about to kill me. However, I'm seeing the most improvement by meditating, going on walks, and focusing on work. This whole situation is scary but most people recover and if you are young, you have very little to worry about. It might take months to recover to like you were before, and that's normal of pneumonia. If you make it past 4 weeks and improve every week you have no reason to worry about getting seriously ill or dying, you are going to be ok. I worried for 2 whole months after getting sick and I really think it just made my recovery slower. Main point: most of us are going to be ok.

Any long haulers who genuinely lived a health/non toxic life before becoming Covid positive?	"Hi all, I'm really interested to see if there are long haulers (or people who developed nasty symptoms) that genuinely lived a health and non-toxic lifestyle before becoming sick. I've heard so many people say ""he/she was young and healthy"" but was that really true? Did they eat an organic diet? Do they live in a city where there are high amounts of pollution/pm2.5? Did they live in a town that sprays massive amounts of pesticides? Our world has become chemicalized and most people don't even realize how toxic their lifestyle/environment is. The sad reality is, unless you actively avoid the many toxicities in our environment, you likely are not truly healthy. You may exercise and eat healthy, but that does not mean your health hasn't been compromised by the world we live in today. I would love to hear your thoughts. Let's have a discussion regarding this topic. And if you haven't heard of Dr. Zach Bush, I suggest you check him out. He is the voice we need during this pandemic."

Am I still contagious?	Hey you guys, hope you're staying safe. So, my symptoms started on 9/03 and tested positive on 9/07. The public health official told me my last day of quarantine was 9/14 and that I can resume my normal life after that as I won't be contagious. My question is, does anyone know if that is accurate? My only lingering symptom is a light cough that comes and goes but I don't want to risk getting anybody else sick. Does anyone have any insight? Thanks!	Am I still contagious?

Any reason to worry?	Hi all, So I had 5 friends over at my house this day last week (Friday July 24) and we were all in fairly close proximity for the entire weekend. We spent the weekend at the beach swimming and sight seeing, despite the heavy rain that occurred. Now on Tuesday I began to feel slightly run down (slight fatigue, scratchy throat and dizzyness). Since then, the dizzyness and fatigue have subsided, however my throat remains scratchy and I find myself sweating profusely from my legs when I try to sleep at night(this always happens when I develop a cold). At last check, my temperature was 97.1 and none of the people I was in contact with that weekend have developed any symptoms, nor have any of their immediate family or mine. My mother refuses to let me ring my GP as she thinks I have just developed a cold from being out swimming/in the rain, however I'm not totally convinced by her rational without getting tested. I was just wondering what some people's inputs on here would be? I don't think I have it, but surely I should get tested to be on the safe side, right? Thanks! (FYI, before	Any reason to worry?

Sinus pressure from hell	Anyone experience sinus pressure when they first got it? I've had the worst pressure ever and nothing helps. Tylenol, nasal congestion meds did nothing. There's no infection or mucus up there either, anything that does come out is clear. I had the worse sinus MIGRAINE of my life last night. I normally suffer from headaches and migraines. I had them pretty much figured out before I got sick. Nothing could touch this headache and it got worse as the night went on. I couldn't sleep, I took way too much melatonin. But nothing would help. It was a pounding stabbing feeling and if I moved it would pound and stab right around my sinus cavity and on top of my head. I finally fell asleep with a heating pad over my face at 5 am Am I alone?

What is relieving your symptoms?	I thought we could share tips for recovery and at home self care. Thus far, the most helpful prescription I got was an albuteral inhaler and my humidifier.

Question about Obesity and Testing Positive	I’ve been through a lot these past few years. I’m 20 and got really obese and I feel like I’m really at risk to this virus. A group of people from my college class outright told me, I’m going to be the first to go because I’m very fat. Can losing weight and changing diet while this pandemic occurs soften the blow of this virus’s impact on my body? I’m terrified about the thought of dying since I help support my parents and younger brothers here at home. Is there any way to help my immune system during this? Please. Any help is appreciated.

8 days into a few symptoms, does this track w/ anyone's experience?	Hey y’all, I’ll start by saying I’ve taken this thing very seriously from the start, and have been prone to serious anxiety during the past (endless) few months. Curious as to any input anybody has, as well as if any of this “tracks” w a progression of symptoms anyone has experienced. About me: 35 M, 215lbs, in decent overall shape (altho a smoker, working on quitting) Day 1: Neck pain when turning head. I’ve had neck pain and tension headaches for forever (mostly due to sleeping posture). This pain has continued throughout my experience: a dull type, not sharp Day 2: An odd feeling when swallowing, back of the tongue kind of thing. Identical to a sensation I experienced last summer around this same time (allergies/dehydration, went away after Flonase use). Find out one tonsil is enflamed w a couple white spots, same side as my neck pain Day 3 (Saturday) Tonsil soreness continues but white spots vanish after some rehydration and salt-water gargling Day 4: Kind of a worn out throat (I smoked some cigs the night before, dumb I know) Day 5-6: Start worrying a lot and enter anxiety mode, constantly checking temp and oxygen saturation w pulse	8 days into a few symptoms, does this track w/ anyone's experience?

I have a partial loss of taste but I’ve been chewing raw ginger and raw onions. Should I be worried?	Does eating raw ginger and raw onions mess with your taste?

Can my mom get fired for being positive?	My mom tested positive last week and was already feeling better a few days after. She’s been symptom free for close to a week now. However, her work said that they’re planning on re opening most likely in July and everyone has to report to work to get tested this upcoming Monday. My mom is scared to tell them she’s already tested positive, and she’s scared she will test positive again this upcoming Monday. Would she get in trouble for being positive already and not telling them when she comes into get a test? She will NOT be returning back to work until probably July (which I don’t understand the point of testing so fast). At the point she will even comes to work she is probably not contagious anymore (had it end of April). She doesn’t wanna disclose the fact that she already tested last week for it, scared of being fired or them giving her position away, or other people talking about her and shunning her (she’s asian and scared) When she tested, it was the health district the tested her. If she tests positive again with her work, the health district will probably get notified again.	Can my mom get fired for being positive?

Convinced I have it	Hey all This past week, I took a family vacation to a destination I had to fly to. The vacation was masked and socially distanced, but being in an area with a high case load of Covid, I felt on edge the whole time (we were about 2 hours from anywhere densely populated, at a low key private resort) Out of nowhere a few days ago, I started thinking that I had started to develop symptoms. I’m having a little bit of a burning sensation in my chest, feel the urge to take deep breaths, feel fatigued and slight upset stomach. I don’t have a fever, don’t have loss of smell or taste, no cough and no muscle pain. When I’m distracted, I forget about the breathing issue. I suffer from health anxiety and panic disorder. I can’t tell if my anxiety is manifesting these symptoms or if I actually have them. I bring it up to my family but they don’t take my anxiety seriously. Anyone experience something similar ? Or if you’ve had Covid, does my situation sound like something I should be concerned about? I’m so scared that if I do get Covid, I’ll get really sick.

Severe GI issues and high fever for 6 days...any other folks with similar experiences?	My father has been having severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting for 6 days straight. He is 64 years old and is a previous smoker and has high blood pressure issues. He had to travel for work within our country and has been at home in self isolation for over a week now. His fever peaks at 102 and has consistently been at 100-102 range when not on tylenol. He has been absolutely beaten down by this, complete exhaustion, barely can speak for more than a minute or so and sleeps for hours and hours a day. At the onset of fever, he has sever chills and full body aches -- his voice shakes and can barely speak. Received a negative on the IgG antibody test and we have STILL not received results for the COVID19 diagnostic test that he took 5 days ago. Given his symptoms, his doctor gave a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19. He has a minor infrequent cough and no other respiratory symptoms. Consistently his oxygen levels have been at 97%-98% via a pulse oximeter. We have been trying to make sure he is replenishing his electrolytes with Gatorade, Pedialyte, and non-dairy Glucerna/Ensure.

After suffering through two collapsed lungs and more secondary infections my dad finally died peacefully on Wednesday June 3. He's gone way too soon and I have a lot of anger about this entire situation but for now we are just trying to celebrate his amazing life and find our new way forward. Thanks to everybody who read my previous posts and contacted me, my family followed along and all the supportive comments we received really meant a lot to us - and we also used the medical suggestions in our discussions with his care team. We are heartbroken and devastated but we know that there are thousands of other families across the country and the world who know how we feel right now :(	My dad died this week Just posting the final, unfortunate update on my dad (previous posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fxxi7l/dad_on_vent_for_over_two_weeks_just_got_a_scary/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/gdfiu9/looking_for_hope_dad_on_vent_for_40_days/)).

Grandma Presumptive +	It is not confirmed yet, but my grandma passed away earlier this morning from what is probably COVID19. She was 88 years old, lived in a long term memory care facility b/c of dementia, had TB back and the doctors back then removed some of her lungs- and ultimately succumbed to the detail. I wasn't really close with my grandma as she was not the nicest or most affectionate person. But either way even if I wasn't close, its still extremely sad. I now only have one living grandparent. I'm not too sure of the details, but the virus completely took over her. &amp;#x200B; Be well, all.

COVID in November 2019!?	I fell ill in late November 2019, around the 17th, right after attending a packed concert with my girlfriend in London. Ran a fever of 39c+ (from my memory) but self medicated with ibuprofen and paracetamol. Fever passes after a few days. Everything seems fine (background: I’m asthmatic) then I start getting more trouble breathing on and off, and dizzy spells. I would become dizzy to the point of needing to sit down for a few minutes. And it felt as though I couldn’t catch my breath for hours at a time but periodically with no apparent cause!? Any of those symptoms sound familiar? I highly doubt it myself, but my dad who fell ill after I met him a couple days after is suspicious as he was very unwell for a good week or more.	COVID in November 2019!?

Only Gastrointestinal symptoms, could it be Covid?	So my household members developed stomach issues which I brushed off as food poisoning. Three days later I’m in the same boat. Their stomach issues have gone away though. Some aches here and there but no respiratory symptoms. We all have been eating same food for past 3 days for sure, strange for me to get it poisoning and not others. Thinking of getting tested but wondering would a nasal swipe even show anything if the virus if there seems to be in intestines?	Only Gastrointestinal symptoms, could it be Covid?

So I’ve been noticing some symptoms appear only in the morning or right before bed, but NEVER during the day: Runny nose, enough to where sometimes I wake up and my nose is right clogged Sneezing (pretty normal but it seems to peak before bed or in the morning) Dry cough, almost feels involuntary but I can hold my breath for more than 10 seconds without discomfort Headache occasionally Those are the only symptoms I have, it’s currently 4:00 where I live (Ontario, Canada) and I had these at maybe 8:00 am but they went away just hours after waking up. Sometimes they reappear before bed or in the middle of the night but I’ve never had a fever or body aches, nothing that crazy.

I have not been tested!	My wife (45f) and I (46m) have been very careful working from home since this all started and we took our children out of school before they closed. 8 days ago I went to my mothers house 2 1/2 hours away to help her install some lights on her deck. I had been furloughed from work that week. I was only there a day and went home that evening. About 2 days later I started having what I’d describe as a “bubbly tummy” and just slightly loose stools for a couple of days. My wife also started having the same symptoms shortly after. I found out that about a week before I went to moms that she’d been sick with nausea and diarrhea for a few days. She didn’t seem 100% when I was there. As the week progressed my wife had a very mild fever off and on with waves of nausea. Then my children (8m and 5f). also got fevers under 100 degrees. My wife and I started to get sore throats and have had some pressure in our upper chest and can feel our lungs. We have also been a bit dizzy and my wife feels like	I have not been tested!

Couples who both have Covid19	"So i've tried searching around but can't seem to find any good information on this.

I had a low grade fever, chills, cough, sore throat, lots of back pain. She is still feeling pretty crappy. I'm going to get tested this weekend and she has a Dr appointment for Monday.

Future immunity after recovery?	I'm on day 6 and got my positive test result yesterday morning. I am a firefighter/paramedic and usually work on a very busy 911 ambulance. Once I'm recovered and return to work I'm sure I will be constantly transporting Covid patients and will continue to have a high exposure level.

After his knee surgery he was supposed to have his other shoulder surgery and a spinal surgery.

Sharing our current status	My husband is on Day 9 of fever and today is the first day that he said he had even the slightest improvement. His fever is under 100 for a change. He’s lost over 5 lbs. He got his positive test result on Monday after a 5 day wait. His other main symptoms are limited taste/smell, chest tightness, cough, muscle aches, upset stomach. For myself, I’m on day 4 of fever, but have been congested for over a week. I went to get a nasal swab test yesterday. My sense of smell left last night. My cough is more about clearing congestion, I don’t have urge to cough. Fever has been up to about 101, but on advice of a coworker who survived I have stopped taking Tylenol. He suggested just letting fever run high until it finally breaks. I sweated all night and I woke up with SOB this morning. had a panic around pulse ox readings varying in the low 90s. Also my blood pressure is unusually low. I’m usually 130/90 but never on bp meds. Today I am 115/80. Drinking pedialyte in case that is from dehydration as I had diarrhea for 2 days.

Another friend developed a fever on Thursday. My symptoms: Body aches. Congestion. Cough. Tested thru Kaiser on Thursday. Fevers in and out. 99.7, 98.7, 100.9, 99.0, 100.4, 98.6, 100.2. Body pains. Lost sense of taste and smell Thursday night. Didn't have access to thermometer but very confident in fever on Friday. Was told 2-3 business days for results. Heard might take a week. I have asthma and was a former smoker. Quit in January due to Covid concerns but here I am. Waiting on test results but by the looks of it I'm pretty sure I have as does my doctor per televisit. I'm pretty scared if I'm being honest. I've been having shortness of breath when walking flight of stairs. Feels like I just ran. Worst part is I'm not even worried about myself. I'm scared for my family. They haven't shown any symptoms but they're at risk. Sister and mother are obese and father is an alcoholic who just quit a month ago due to a health scare.

Have any of you had a severe and persistent sore throat as a main symptom?	Got tested lasted Monday 6/15, still waiting for results. That Monday I was experiencing a sore throat, body aches, headache, chills, and a mild fever. Throughout the rest of the week all the symptoms, aside from the sore throat eventually subsided. Come Wednesday, my sore throat became severe which lasted up until Saturday. That Saturday all the other symptoms came back. Currently, I still have a moderate sore throat and nothing more. They ran a strep, mono, and throat culture test, all came back negative. Has anyone who tested positive for covid experienced the same or something similar?

Hugged someone who tested positive last week, do I definitely have it?	This was last Friday. He’s asymptomatic except for the taste/smell thing. I don’t have any symptoms whatsoever. We hugged and then spoke for about 15 minutes a few feet away. I have people that I’ve been around that would absolutely get ravaged if they contracted Covid and I’m terrified I gave it to them. I have a video appt in a few minutes to get assessed and approved for testing. In your experience, does contact like I’ve mentioned mean I have definitely contracted the virus?

(False?) Negative test... advice?	Hi all. I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and would love some of your thoughts. I am a young adult located in a US city that currently has significant community spread of Covid-19. Three people in my apartment building that I have spent time with over the past few weeks have recently tested positive. I came down with symptoms last week that completely mirrored my friend’s symptoms with confirmed covid. Started with fever, chills, and fatigue. Progresses into body pain, headache, and stomach pain. Then developed significant shortness of breath, lung pain, and loss of smell and taste. No cough, but occasional sputum production. I also have had many “waves” which seems to be many people’s experience as well. I’m on day 8 and still feel fairly affected by this bug. Here’s the challenge.. I went in for testing on Friday and got examined by my major city’s hospital’s COVID clinic and the doctor there said he was fairly convinced that I was infected. The nurse who took my swab was being trained under another nurse and I think there is a chance she didn’t go in far enough because it was wasn’t uncomfortable and she only went	(False?)

did anyone else experience a weird rash	I developed a weird rash all over my arms, neck, chest, and back. I didn't associate it at the time with the fever and respiratory problems I had been having and thought maybe i'd been exposed to a chemical at work that had caused an allergy. then i read it was a symptom of covid for some people. i also remember looking at my toes and they looked really weird and purple and I thought it was chilblains.	did anyone else experience a weird rash I developed a weird rash all over my arms, neck, chest, and back.

Wonder if I had it Los Angeles	I came home from work on New Year’s Eve on the train, I work in downtown Los Angeles lots of international travellers always around as you can imagine I work in an area where the new condos and high-rises funded from Asia are going up lots of foreign students.

Sickness headaches, high temp but nothing that felt worse than the flu or pneumonia I have previously had, I spent all of January and the first week of February feeling so tired and run down and body aches in so many different places different each day from ankles to knees hips, fingers I persevered with just if I recall 3 days off work and finally started feeling better mid February.

Just found out I’m positive today	F/19 I thought I had strep because those were the only symptoms I was having. I started having symptoms on July 9th with diarrhea and a sore throat. July 10th my sore throat got worse and I could feel my body aching with the beginning of a fever. I stayed in bed mostly that day. I fell asleep around 7 pm that evening and woke up around 11 pm with a terrible fever. I tested it with one of the automatic forehead thermometer and it read 98.6 so it wasn’t accurate. I took acetaminophen to reduce my fever. The next morning (the 11th) I woke around noon and didn’t have a fever anymore but I tried to eat some toast and it was the saltiest thing I’d ever tasted. I had my boyfriend order me Chinese that night and on the food I smelled a terrible metallic chemical smell and thought that the food was bad so I didn’t eat it. Then I tried to eat a hot dog later that day and I smelled the same smell so this is when I started worrying.

How severe have COVID symptoms been for teenagers?	I (17M) woke up today with minor postnasal drip (I usually get this when I wake up but it was a little more today) and I think my throat is becoming a little sore (very subtle; bearly noticeable). I've coughed lightly maybe three or four times today to clear my throat (I think I'm doing this because I'm parnoid rather than the throat). My state allowed schools to resume outdoor in-person workouts which I have been attending. There's 70ish kids there but everyone is temp checked and takes a health survey before entering and we are socially distancing the whole time. I'm hoping this is all in my head and it'll clear so I can enjoy the 4th next weekend.	How severe have COVID symptoms been for teenagers?

Partial loss of smell and fatigue?	I have had a partial loss of smell for the past 5 to 6 days now, not fully, it’s not going away and it’s quite annoying. It’s hard to explain but you know that kind of smell after you cry? It’s been in the back of my nose for days and making me unable to smell things partially. I also feel like I’m losing my taste buds. It could be allergies but I’m not sure. I’ve also have been feeling very tired lately and slept in early, and have been taking naps throughout the day. But I can’t shake that tired feeling off. I’m wondering how it was for any of you who tested positive, idk if I should get tested and if it’s serious enough. A couple weeks ago that I also mentioned on here, I’ve had body aches to where it was a little hard to walk up the stairs, which was one of my first symptoms and that’s when I started worrying, but fortunately that went away. But now this is happening to me. My family has been feeling fine. Strange.	Partial loss of smell and fatigue?

Itchy Lungs	So a couple of weeks ago I went to get tested at CVS with those “Self-Testing drive thru” places. I tested Negative. Then I found out there’s such a thing like “False Negatives”. So I went to an actual clinic, and had somebody perform the test on me this time. Days later it came back negative or (not detected) again. But anyway, I began to isolate myself regardless from my family. Some context: I am a 25 yr old Male, with no known pre-existing conditions. I weight 177lbs with a height of 5”5, so slightly overweight. I work from home, use curbside pickup for groceries so no contact with the store people at all. The only time I went out is to fill up a small propane tank to this local place nearby and the guy there was wearing a mask and gloves. I was also wearing gloves, glasses, and double mask. 2 days later I began to feel this... soreness in my throat.. then it went down to my chest. As to when I breathe OUT it felt like a burning sensation more or less. Started to get some diarrhea, and mild headaches the first days too.

Swab day ~45 neg, IgG neg, now what	My main issue is that my doctors have dismissed me, so I'm at a loss. Exactly two weeks after arriving back home from a country which now has an excess death of 8x, I had an onset of symptoms that landed me in the ER - strange feeling at the bottom left rib/upper stomach, tachycardia, collapsing to the ground, tight chest, difficulty breathing, tight upper arms and upper back, confusion, chills/shakes, and maybe hypertension. All tests were clean - chest xray, EKG, blood count, d-dimmer (inconclusive), chest CT - and I was discharged with stress, anxiety, and panic attack. I took my diagnosis seriously even though I'm lucky that the lockdown has been extremely relaxing for me and I feel great. I developed a few extra symptoms, rested for a week, and started meditation, talking to people, and going out to exercise. Everything then went drastically downhill including extreme fatigue (fell over and slept), more severe brain fog, higher temp and eventually fever, night sweats, overheating, hypertension standing up, tachycardia standing up, tachycardia randomly when sitting, migraines, and oh so much more. Only at my pressing, I got more tests and everything is clean (fuller bloodwork, vitamin levels, holter monitor,	Swab day ~45 neg, IgG neg, now what My main issue is that my doctors have dismissed me, so I'm at a loss.

Worried about my mother who is in the hospital. She tested false negative twice but I have my doubts because a doctor thinks I may have had COVID-19	Before I discuss my mother, I'd like to write about myself. About a month ago, I came down with a really bad stomach ache and headache. I though it was strange and felt like my heart was beating a little too hard at times with some occasional chest pain. Eventually, I had body aches through out my body, had diarrhea but no fever or cough. My tongue's taste begins to feel enhanced as if I can taste things I shouldn't taste. Eventually, most of the body aches have gone away. My heart issues begin to subside. I do feel warm at times along with occasional stomach rumbling and I wanted to go to a doctor but I had no insurance to figure out what was wrong at the moment. A few days, I found a good place to go to without insurance. I talked to a doctor through Telemed and told her my symptoms. She said I probably had COVID-19 from the symptoms she was listening to from me. She wants me to go get an antibody test and I've been trying to get a test from a hospital but they want more information from my doctor for some reason	Worried about my mother who is in the hospital.

New smell is gross	I got my first symptoms of COVID on March 23rd. Two days later, zero smell or taste. Only way I could “taste” my food was if I dumped hot sauce and vinegar on it. Two weeks later when I finished my quarantine, my smell had slowly improved so I could sort of smell peppermint oil if I put it directly under my nose. Almost four months later, I can generally smell (and name correctly) things if it’s right under my nose. But I wouldn’t notice if the trash bin was smelling up the kitchen, that sort of thing was too subtle. And generally speaking, all smells are missing components to them. Basil doesn’t smell as nice as it used to. My rose perfume feels shallow somehow, not full bodied. Fast forward to 10 days ago, I had horrible allergies and couldn’t stop sneezing all day. Took some medicine to help control the sneezing and runny nose. The next day, my nose was back to manageable, but I noticed my smell had gotten worse. What’s WEIRD is that now I have one scent that comes up with all things “savory”, and it’s really unpleasant.

Need a negative test to return to work	Hi all, I tested positive back on July 23rd. My company offered to pay for a rapid results test on 7/30 in hopes I could return to work. I was showing minimal symptoms at the time (cough and minor fever, nothing over 100) but it came back negative. It’s now been 2 weeks since my original negative test, 16 days overall since symptoms started showing. Would I be safe to re-test now? I’d be paying out of pocket for this test ($200) so I’d like to make sure I’m safe. Currently the only symptom I’m showing is a minimal cough (just feels like I need to clear my throat every now and then) my sense of smell and taste have returned, no more body aches or chills or fever. Thanks for any help with this matter.	Need a negative test to return to work Hi all, I tested positive back on July 23rd.

Metallic Taste in Mouth about once a day (lasts a couple seconds)	Has anyone had this? I haven’t tested positive, and I haven’t had any symptoms.

It lasts a very short amount of time and goes away after I swallow my saliva a few times. Some days this doesn’t even happen at all. Is this related to COVID-19 at all?

Relapse? No, I'm reinfected	So I have posted here, back in March when I had first gotten sick. Had all the symptoms, nausea, diarrhea, headache, sore throat and on days 10-12 got hit with the chest tightness and shortness of breath. It was terrifying and is probably the cause of my anxiety at night because that's when I got it the worst. I got tested on day 11 when I was pretty bad and it came back negative. Negative! I was so confused and felt like a crazy person. However, this sub made me realize that I'm not the only one. I've have relapses, nothing serious, a bit of a wheeze here, sore throat there. Never pushed my self too hard, did some walking. Overall, not feeling 100% but better than when I was at my worst. Wednesday, I have a runny nose all day. I assume it's allergies. No biggie. Then at night I have this weird chest pain and my hands have a weird tingle. I couldn't sleep. I just felt like something was wrong. I felt like I was sick again. I get little to no sleep.

Looking for similar experience	My fiancée started feeling symptoms last Saturday (7 days ago) and tested positive on Monday (5 days ago). We have not distanced from each other at all, but I tested negative on Thursday (2 days ago). Has anyone had this experience? Does this mean the tests just couldn’t detect it in my system yet, or maybe I haven’t been infected yet? I’m honestly confused how I’m negative even though we’ve been spent all of our time together for the entire week that she has shown symptoms.

I ask because I first had symptoms on July 1, got tested July 2, and results came back positive on 10th. I was told to isolate until July 15th and I can retest if I wanted to, as long as I had no fever for 72 hours. The only symptom I had was complete loss of taste and smell. Other than that, I feel completely fine. As of today, it’s about 10% back. Should I get re tested at the end of my isolation even though my senses may not be 100% back? And would it be safe to go out after my isolation period without getting retested, or should I wait until I get a negative result? Thanks in advance for any help.

Any positive parents of babies?	I’m the parent of a child under 3mo old. My partner and I are both positive with symptoms and we’re confident the baby has been exposed, but he’s not showing any symptoms currently. Are there any other parents of babies or infants out there who can share their story? We’re feeling such guilt about this all happening with our child around, not that we could have predicted it (we had been taking precautions but probably got it from a positive relative).

I just finished my 14 day isolation, but I'm afraid that I'll infect my family if I go out of my room.	I started with very mild symptoms (nasal congestion, headache, loss of taste/smell) on June 28, got confirmed positive by PCR test on June 30 and have been in isolation since then, my doctor says that a negative test is not necessary, since it's been more than 10 days after the symptoms started and I've been symptom free for 3 days, and that I can end my isolation. But I live with my parents aged 60+, and so far I've managed not to infect them, and I'm afraid that they'll get sick if I break isolation too early. Has this happened to any of you? What has your experience been?	I just finished my 14 day isolation, but I'm afraid that I'll infect my family if I go out of my room.

Lung Pain in Back?	I had a mild but crappy case for about 7 days. I’ve started feeling a lot better the last 3 or 4 days with some exceptions. If I exert myself too much, I have coughing fits and very mild shortness of breath and then the next day I’ll be fatigued. But today I started feeling right lung discomfort in my back. It’s really uncomfortable. I keep moving and contorting my body to try and make it comfortable but I cannot. Almost feels like someone tied a small knot in my upper right lung. But all the discomfort is in my back and not the chest. Is this normal? I was planning on calling my doctor tomorrow to ask them but my friend thinks I should go to the ER. I think the ER is overkill at this point and I’d prefer not to be there right now.	Lung Pain in Back? I had a mild but crappy case for about 7 days.

Kids showing symptoms/positive	I’m looking for info on kids becoming symptomatic and severity on them. One of my kids came down with fever, chills and pretty decent cough tonight.

Exercising after COVID-19	I'm a 28 y/o M who tested positive on March 27, 2020. I had mild respiratory symptoms including shortness of breath, painful breathing, and slightly decreased O2 saturations. I also suffered GI symptoms, as well as ran a low grade fever for about 7 days after positive diagnosis. I'm still suffering from general fatigue and weakness at times, but have been able to return to work as a nurse. Prior to testing positive for COVID-19 I had began living a very active lifestyle exercising (cardio and weight training) 2-3 hours per day 6-7 days per week. I'm still considered obese and did have some weight gain during the illness due to not being able to exercise for a month (approximately 10 lbs.) Tonight, after a month, I decided to try to exercise again. It took everything in me to complete 10 minutes on the treadmill at 3 miles an hour. I became very short of breath, light headed, experienced tachycardia (172 bpm.) This is quite uncommon for me. I was wondered if anyone else recovering has experienced these symptoms when they began trying to get back into their normal routine, or if it is just deconditioning. I appreciate any input!

Five months have been passed since I lost my taste and smell. Help needed.	I don't want to discourage you guys and my prayers and wishes are with you guys. I did not have any other symptoms other than the loss of taste and smell and now five months have been passed and still made no recovery. I went to several doctors and all they were saying that it will recover after some time. However, today I went to a doctor who was working with the COVID vaccine research team and he said that some patients may permanently lose their both sense because of permanent olfactory dysfunction. The cases are very rare but they exist and the scientists are still unable to made any progress about this. And i also found this on a [Webmd](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200604/covid19-loss-of-smell-taste-might-be-long-term). What should I do in this situation please give me any advice. I can't bear this anymore, since 5 months the food feels like shit. And i can't smell anything.	Five months have been passed since I lost my taste and smell. Help needed.

Tested positive	I got tested on Thursday because the day before I lost my sense of taste and smell. I knew once that happened the test would be positive. I have a little bit of stuffiness in my nose but that’s it. I don’t have a fever or any other related symptoms. I don’t know how long it’ll take for those senses to come back. It sucks because everything taste like nothing. I can only tell if something is sweet, spicy, bitter, etc.. I wish everyone a fast road to recovery.

Should I be worried?	I went to a nail salon Sunday 8/9, and the employee in the salon was coughing. I asked the salon owner if the employee was sick, and she stated that he just had allergies. The coughing employee had on 2 masks, I had on a mask, everyone in the salon was wearing masks, and there were also shields everywhere. It was a minor cough, but again you never know. Fast forward to yesterday I have been sneezing a little bit and coughing a little as well, all of which seems like sinuses. I have no fever, and my oxygen is at 99%. I feel fine, but I think my anxiety has me feeling sick and anxious. I got tested today and a precaution. Should I be worried? How soon after exposure did you feel symptoms? What were your first symptoms?	Should I be worried? I went to a nail salon Sunday 8/9, and the employee in the salon was coughing.

Possible mild case?	I’m 29 and female, over weight not sure of my bmi and I vape. I’m not sure if I have/had a possible mild case of covid19. My symptoms started out with a sore throat that came and went for about two weeks. During that two week period I developed a mild fever around 101 at its highest. I had chills too. I still have an occasional dry cough but it’s not constant just annoying when it starts. I’m still very tired three weeks later and still have a dry cough. My mam is positive,I don’t live with her, I last seen her on March 16th and her symptoms started on the 17th/18th and mine started the following week. How likely is it that I got a mild case? My partner has had a cough no other symptoms and my children seem unaffected? Unfortunately trying to get a test is difficult my sister got tested nearly two weeks ago and no result yet. She only got tested because she works in healthcare. My mam got tested before they changed the criteria here.

Worried that I might be mentally convincing myself I have COVID when I don’t	Put myself in the not best of situations last weekend. I was surrounded by a bunch of strangers not wearing masks. So I’m worried maybe that’s how I caught it? So basically this whole week I’ve felt off. I don’t exactly have the normal symptoms but I just feel really tired. Mostly my face does. I like to think it’s because I got new glasses a week ago and the prescription is stronger so I’m getting used to them. But it’s been almost 9 days since I’ve got them. My face just feels worn out halfway through the day. I’ve also been feeling some weird feeling in my chest/stomach. Kinda like heartburn but not really. It’s just been a relay weird week for me. Just feeling tired and checked out. Have had no desire to work out even tho I was doing that almost every day. I doubt it’s COVID but it’s really been on my mind that it could be.

Does anyone have any experience with a loved one who survived a medically induced coma?	"Hello all I may have chosen the wrong flair for this, but at the moment I am very worried about my grandpa who is currently in the hospital. Many in my family have been infected after my aunt who lives with half of my relatives carelessly shrugged off her symptoms as a cold causing my grandparents who have not gone outside for months to get sick.

He is in his late 60s and had to be taken to the hospital because his oxygen levels were low and they found out he had diabetes as well which caught everyone off guard because my grandpa was a healthy person who did not smoke and rarely drank. Now I told my friend about our situation and she said ""whatever you do, do not let them put your grandpa in an induced coma because he can die"" she said that because she that is how her aunt died while she also had covid.

A positive swab test (after 67-ish days since initial symptoms have occurred)	Symptoms started the beginning of the week of March 23rd for my mother. I presumed it was Covid 19 due to the kind of symptoms she initially started with which was a sore throat, dry cough, a fever, and a lot of sticky mucus in her upper respiratory track. We definitely knew what was up once other members of our small household such as myself (age:22) and my grandmother (age:76) also began to display the same symptoms. we immediately began combatting our symptoms with OTC medication such as dayquil, nyquil, zyrtec, mucinex, vicks, tylenol, vitamin D &amp; C, staying hydrated as well as plenty of homemade tea.. you name it. All of us have had relatively moderate cases, I wouldnt call them severe as none of us have required hospitalization, and we’ve all just been taking it slowly working it out as we go day by day. None of us were confirmed positive though as we havent been to the doctors because of us not really having any extra money to pay out of pocket since none of us have health insurance anymore. however, just recently my mother (age:51) was able to get swabbed last week, as it seems her	A positive swab test (after 67-ish days since initial symptoms have occurred) Symptoms started the beginning of the week of March 23rd for my mother.

Persistent cough won't go away.	So my wife worked with someone who tested positive and then ended up giving it to me. Her symptoms seemed to be milder than mine and after 7-ish days she is feeling back to normal. My symptoms started on 3/17 with a dry cough, then by the next day I had leg aches and lower back aches. 2 days later I had a fever of 101 and chills all day. That was the only time I ever had a fever. by 3/20 I thought I was mostly out of the woods except for the occasional cough. But then by 3/24 the dry cough came back and it was much more persistent. Every time I took a deep breath or tried to talk I was coughing. This has been consistent over the last 4 days. I can't tell if I'm coughing because of shortness of breath so i bought an Oximeter and it seems like it is always up over 95 which is considered good. Today I also woke up with what seems like either a stye or pink eye in my left eye. I am still constantly coughing.

I got the results from my test (nose swab), and it came back negative, without much surprise (it was taken on day 41). My symptoms are still there (fatigue, fever, oppression in the chest, headaches), although they seem to be diminishing slowly. I am wondering if this means that the virus is out of my body? Or if it just means it is not as active anymore, or was a false negative or something?

Jessica’s eldest child went to spend time with his dad (her ex) and came back to her house and exposed himself and Jessica because turns out the dad tested positive for COVID. My friend Tina’s parents and sister are sick with Covid symptoms and took her parents to the ER. Yet neither of them thought to let me know this before I saw them in person?! Can I be potentially exposed through both my friends even though. I can’t believe I was so stupid. I mean I wore my mask and glasses to cover my eyes but still. What should I do besides self quarantine Edit: last two weeks I was in self quarantine because I was sick with symptoms and got tested which came back negative and I started to feel better the past weekend. So stupid me thought I was okay and since I would wear my mask and glasses while I hung out with my two friends (plus social distancing) I would be okay.	Could I have been exposed?

Anyone allowed to get FMLA or an excused absence longer than 2 weeks due to covid? I’m still so sick.	I’ve been sick for 5 weeks and I work from home. I worked the first half of it and then couldn’t anymore. I was only allowed 2 weeks off, as that was the norm for being tested positive. Fever and chest pains are back and I’m supposed to go back to work. My job will not let me unless I take FMLA and HR said I have to get a doctors note saying I need FMLA. I just can’t get a doctor to take me seriously that I still have symptoms. I tested positive 4/3.	Anyone allowed to get FMLA or an excused absence longer than 2 weeks due to covid? I’m still so sick.

I'm getting concerned that I may have COVID	Beginning on Saturday morning, I felt extremely fatigued (after a full night's rest), nauseous, had body aches, chills, and a headache. Those symptoms have not let up and now, I've got a sore throat as well. To add to the mix, last Wednesday, my psychiatrist doubled my dose of Lamictal; when a dose is decreased or increased, Lamictal can often produce flu-like symptoms in patients. My psychiatrist told me this last Wednesday, but is now telling me he did \*not\* say this and that I need to be tested for COVID immediately. His reaction kind of freaked me out, to be honest. I've got a video visit set up for tomorrow morning with a doctor, and I'm assuming I'll be allowed to be tested after that. Does anyone here think I have cause for being concerned? Also, does anyone have advice on socially distancing when you live in a home with other people? I'm trying my best not to touch things when I don't have to, because I don't want my dad to get sick.

Should someone who tested positive ask for anti anxiety medication to keep blood pressure low?	My friend is positive. Fear of dying and isolation has his blood pressure through the roof with every panic attack wave (that is apparently happening during coughing fits) . (he has been panicking daily) Should he is afraid to ask his doc for anxiety meds to keep his blood pressure low? I hear this virus can cause people to stroke out with clots if BP is too high. Worried for my friend's life.	Should someone who tested positive ask for anti anxiety medication to keep blood pressure low? My friend is positive.

Anyone have these symptoms?	A few days ago, the left side of my jaw started hurting. Then I started getting a headache and acid reflux which has lasted 2 days now. My left ear also feels increasingly stuffy and sometimes pops. My temp is 98.8 which is a little high for me. Did anyone that tested positive have these symptoms? I find it odd that I have several issues that hit me at once.	Anyone have these symptoms? A few days ago, the left side of my jaw started hurting.

I’m pretty sure my boyfriend (25/m) is suffering from post-virus symptoms.	I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this in, if not, please point me in the right direction. Since about March 30th, my boyfriend has had extreme fatigue, chest pains/aches with no mucus, low-grade fevers every few days or so, and a dry cough. He got a rapid test at an urgent care that came up negative and a regular lab test that also came up negative (we got verification a few days ago). He is working from home and has a hard time sitting up for more than 30 minutes. Based on some research, I think he may have had he virus but has recovered. Is there anything I can do/buy to help reduce these symptoms? I hate seeing him like this and I feel so helpless. Additional info: - I don’t have any of these symptoms and we live in a small one bedroom apartment. My heart goes out to everyone in this sub how has/knows someone who has tested positive.

Loss of taste/smell permanently?	Hello all! I am a 20 year old female who tested positive for covid early of July. I initially got tested because I had lost my sense of taste/smell. Now, 2 1/2 months later I still am unable to smell or taste fully. I have been told these senses typically come back after 2 weeks, but this has not been the case for me. None of my family has gotten the virus, so when I mention I still am unable to smell or taste they do not take me seriously. I am starting to worry these senses may never come back. Has anyone experienced this?	Loss of taste/smell permanently? Hello all! I am a 20 year old female who tested positive for covid early of July.

Sore throat only?	I went on a trip for work last week and had flights on Tuesday and Thursday, and kept a mask on the whole time spent in the airport/airplanes. I got COVID tested when I got back on Friday (I know this was probably too early, but I wanted to get it in before our testing site closed down for the weekend), and it came back negative. Over the weekend, I had some hot flashes, mild body aches, and sinus issues, though I feel like all of that could possibly be attributed to a combination of anxiety and wildfire smoke. I got tested again on Monday after experiencing these symptoms, and it came back negative as well. On Tuesday, I developed a sore throat that is constant and more severe than what I would normally have with allergies. I still have the sore throat and some lower back pain (though I've just been sitting inside all week because of the wildfire smoke, so it may be from that). I have no fever, cough, etc. Normally, I wouldn't be too concerned because I just live with two other people who are young and not high risk, but tonight one of my roommates	Sore throat only?

I started ReportCovidUSA, a Covid-19 self-reporting website inspired by mutual-aid style relief.	[www.reportcovidusa.com](https://www.reportcovidusa.com) I first started thinking about self-reporting in early April. For weeks I had been reading testimonials of the same situation over and over: people certain that they had come down with Covid-19, but couldn’t get tested because their symptoms weren’t severe enough, a testing center was hours away, or any number of reasons. On top of the virus's rampage, this shutdown is a crisis of information. Society is paralyzed across the board because nobody is able to make any confident decisions. ReportCovidUSA sources information from the populace to construct a more complete picture of this crisis, and at the time of writing has garnered just over 800 responses. Although anonymous self-reporting can never provide the sort of detailed conclusions that are made in a comprehensive scientific effort, it can contribute. The more knowledge an individual or organization has, the more confidently they can take decisive, pragmatic action moving forward.

A Restaurant I went to last night for take out just closed for COVID—what do I do?	My friend and I went to a restaurant last night and ordered takeout. we were wearing our masks when we went in (mine a disposable surgical mask not a N95, hers a heavy mixed fabric mask from Amazon that has a holder for a filter. We didn’t take our masks off within distance of any other person in the restaurant including the staff. We also ordered Izze sodas, which we picked up from the cooler ourselves pre checkout. After we engaged with the man at the register, we used the little bottle of hand sanitizer that was in front of the sneeze guard—which only had a small three inch or so slot at the base for hands to pass money and stuff through. We paid with card on the card reader but we sanitized afterwards. Everyone in the restaurant was wearing masks and gloves. We opened our sodas (bottled) while we waited and pulled down our masks while we drank, pulling them back up after we were done. Overall our masks were probably down a total of four or five minutes for the twenty five we were in the restaurant. When they called out our order, we collected it and	A Restaurant I went to last night for take out just closed for COVID—what do I do?

Low grade fever as only symptom? (4 days in)	Hi all, like the title says, I was wondering if there was anyone here that had a low grade (100-101) fever as their only symptom. Here’s the timeline of events: Saturday: Kid (9) threw up and was feeling crappy all day. He had a temp so the family took ours just to see. Other kid and boyfriend were normal, I had a fever of 100.5. I felt totally normal though with a bit of nausea (I have a chronic stomach condition) &amp; if he hadn’t been sick I wouldn’t have even checked myself Sunday: Got a COVID swab, came back negative (not a rapid test so must’ve been a slow day) Monday: kid is fine, family is fine, I still have a fever and a bit of nausea Today: appetite is coming back but temp got up to 101.6 so I made a teledoc appointment. I was told to wait until Friday and retest. The most bizarre thing of it all is that I do NOT feel feverish. No chills, no sweats, nothing. Does this sound like anyone else’s experience?

Questions on transitioning out of quarantine	I'm on day 5 since a positive test and am starting to think about the end of my quarantine and transitioning back to life, but have a couple of questions. For background, I have been 100% asymptomatic thus far. I only got tested as a proactive measure before weekend plans and was truly surprised it came back positive. I was told to quarantine 10 days from my test date. They said it's 10 days from the start of symptoms or, if asymptomatic, 10 days from your positive test. I had expected it to be 14 days, but they told me that it's 14 day for people who have not yet tested positive but have been directly exposed or have symptoms, to allow for the incubation period. Does this sound right? Should I really emerge from my quarantine on day 11 as though I'm totally safe to others? Relatedly, should I plan to get a test to confirm I'm all clear? They haven't directed me to do so, but I plan to ask on my next check-in with my contact tracer.

Can these be symptoms? Should I get tested?	I have been having some back and hip pain as well as increased anxiety which manifests in difficulty breathing and high blood pressure. The pain isn’t constant, it’s more of a pulsing pain that I feel 2 or 3 times throughout the day. It’s not hard to breathe like a pressure in my chest, more like a choking kind of feeling that you get with anxiety. My nose isn’t completely congested but has been runny. I already have anxiety so it might just be me worrying too much, I keep thinking I caught it after going into a gas station without a mask 4 or 5 days ago. I’ve had the test come back negative 4 times already, the last one taken over a month ago. Even so, I keep thinking I should take it again? Just to be sure, again :/	Can these be symptoms?

These are my symptoms: - lowish oxygen: was 95 for a few days and improved with Flovent inhaler. Low oxygen cane back tonight and it's hovering between 91-96. Was 98 for a few days. - pneumonia - in the right lung. Finished my Zpack a few days ago. Using albuterol and Flovent. - shortness of breath ( went away , came back tonight) - chest tightness, went away, came back slightly tonight - low grade fever...between 99 and 100, but it got better for a day and came back to100.4 today now it's been 99 most of the day. - diarrhea...I've had it 8 out of 10 days daily.

I'm curious as I'm currently experiencing some symptoms but can't be tested because no fever even though some symptoms have been pretty intense.	Symptoms but no fever?

Delayed lost of taste and smell, having trouble eating. Anyone else experience this?	I’ve had symptoms since last Monday June 22nd, and came back positive that Wednesday June 24th. Starting yesterday, my symptoms were all resolved and I felt much better, but today I noticed that I can no longer taste or smell (something I was not experiencing before). The loss of taste is making it very difficult for me to eat. The texture of the food in my mouth and having to chew it without any flavor makes me feel so sick to my stomach. I can barely swallow without shuddering and feeling like I need to gag. I tried to make myself a small dinner, and threw it up immediately after eating :/ Has anyone else had trouble with this? Not just the loss of taste which seems pretty common, but having trouble eating? My appetite has already been pretty bad since I got the virus and this makes it so much worse. Also for those of you who lost their taste and smell a long time ago, how long did it last? Did things ever go back to normal?	Delayed lost of taste and smell, having trouble eating.

Did anyone cough up blood?	My SO (26M, healthy) is currently stuck at Fort Benning with the virus. He is on week 3.5 now, and symptoms haven’t gotten any better. The medics aren’t doing much besides checking vitals, and a hospital is nearly impossible to get into. They finally agreed to see him and drew blood, did a chest X-ray, and ekg. Doctor said everything looked fine. Today, he started coughing up bright red blood. He’s scared. I’m scared. He’s not getting adequate medical care. I’m trying to give him as much support and advice as I can possibly find. I swear I’ve read every damn post on this subreddit but everyone’s symptoms and experiences vary so much.

Day 12 In And Still Fighting It Alone	Honestly I'm coming out truthfully with this, without anyone in my family or friends knowing. It was June 13th that I made that supidest decision to go out and drink at a bar after being extra careful during the whole pandemic, and yes I am one of the stupid ones here in the new epicenter of Florida. My parents and my brother have absolutely become germaphobes ever since this all started, yes my parents live on their own, and my brother lives on his own. My brother and I are furloughed so we have been nicely locked down until everything opens up again. So it was because of their germaphobic ways that got me over the edge(because I dont want to live in fear), and my loneliness from being socially distant from everyone for a couple months took my on that path to risk it for one day. 3 days after that night of NO SOCIAL DISTANCING/NO MASKS, the symptoms started to show up. Dry coughs, fatigue, fever of 101 almost everyday, pneumonia symptoms, cold sweats, completely lost my sense of smell and taste, and after Day 5 I had myself tested to be positive.

My experience with the Rona	On August 7, 2020 I woke up and could not taste or smell anything, otherwise I felt fine other than I was a little tired and my back hurt a little from exercising the prior couple days. I called my work and told them my symptoms and went to a rapid testing site at Walgreens by my house to make sure I was negative. Unfortunately, the test came back positive and it came back quick. After a slight pity party on Friday 8/7 for a few hours I decided to my game on. I immediately started taking my temperature and did so 2 times a day. It never went above 98.3 so that was a plus. I increased my water intake to over gallon of water every day. I also drank ice green tea during the day and hot green tea at night, several glasses of each. I took five 2000 IU D3, one 50 mg of Zinc and one 1000 mg of Vitamin C and my multi vitamin (NOWs ADAM Vitamin for men) every day with food in the morning. Additionally, I took 4 airborne pills throughout the day to keep the vitamins up in my system.

When did you notice your taste/smell senses coming back? Did they come back at all?	I tested about a week ago and my results were positive. My first symptom that I remember is extreme body aches. After that I remember waking up with no taste or smell whatsoever, and I still don’t have those senses back. My family, friends, and boyfriend think I’m crazy and I think they think that I’m making too big a deal out of the loss of those senses, but honestly it really sucks. I got very lucky to not be as sick as some, but I’ve read that some people take months and months to get them back completely, and some people don’t recover them at all. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?	When did you notice your taste/smell senses coming back? Did they come back at all? I tested about a week ago and my results were positive.

Is anyone experiencing a severe personality change?	Hi, I started getting I'll in March and thought it was stress. I have many of the same symptoms you hall have mentioned and a personality change. It's a childlike version of me. Easily confused, forgetful, difficulty talking, trouble understanding simple things, my voice even sounds different. I've gone from being intelligent, articulate, independent woman, to someone who needs adult supervision. Is this happening to anyone else?	Is anyone experiencing a severe personality change?

If any of your blood-related family also tested positive, did their symptoms follow a similar course?	I'm about 50% sure I have COVID (waiting on a test result, which will be 3-5 days). My symptoms started with really severe insomnia, which I'd never had before and it didn't cross my mind could be COVID-related (until I saw some posts on this sub). Then I had just terrible fatigue/malaise, then loss of appetite, mild loss of taste, stomach pain, and GI problems. It's been about a week, and I'm feeling significantly better, just still a little tired. However, since at the beginning, COVID never crossed my mind (I have a new baby, so that's what I chalked the insomnia/fatigue up to), my mom (62) visited us and stayed for 5 days. She's now back home and told me today she had trouble sleeping last night. I'm terrified that I have COVID and inadvertently gave it to her, and she'll be at a much higher risk. &amp;#x200B; For those who tested positive, if any family members did as well, were your symptoms similar and in the same order? I'm curious if there's any genetic component to what symptoms you get.	If any of your blood-related family also tested positive, did their symptoms follow a similar course?

Shortness of Breath question	Did anyone have shortness of breath without pneumonia? I was tested today, and today and yesterday were the first days I’ve been having shortness of breath in weird intervals (relatively okay in the morning but gets worse in the evening), and it just feels like there’s something keeping my lungs from properly expanding so I have to force them to accept oxygen. I also had a chest x ray today, and it came back negative for pneumonia. So I honestly don’t know what’s truly causing my SoB at this point.

WHOOP fitness wristband has given me anxiety relief through all of this.	(25F, Pacific Beach, San Diego, Blood type 0+, light smoker, quit juul last year.) I’m one of those people who believe that San Diego / LA / The Bay has been exposed to covid far earlier than what people are saying. I got pretty sick in December, bad cough that was persistent until February, fever on and off, rapid heart rate (thought it was anxiety), no appetite and loss of taste for a few weeks in Jan. I also was coughing up the weirdest shit. Small clear gel balls. No idea what that was and my doctor didn’t say anything when I told him about it. In 10th grade I had H1N1 (the sickest I’ve ever been in my whole damn life), and during that event I developed mouth ulcers that were shedding skin if that makes sense. My doctor was floored, but they healed and never returned after. Until late February. I believe this virus may be like H1N1 (In my body at least), because I developed - smaller than last time - mouth ulcers that, again, shed.

How long did it take you to infect others living with you (if you did)	I tested negative but I have reason to believe the test wasn’t done properly.

I’ve been living in a house with 5 other people and none of them have had any symptoms yet and it’s been about a week since they saw me.

My roommate tested positive on July 1st. Will the apartment be safe by July 30th to enter?	My roommate tested positive for COVID-19 on July 1st. He has had a mild case and has recovered since then. Fortunately, I was out of town and avoided exposure from him. I haven't gone back since. However, the lease is up on the 31st of July and I have to move everything out. The apartment is small, however we have separate rooms on opposite ends of apartment. We share a kitchen and a hallway (and obviously the door space to enter and exit). How safe will it be to enter? What is my risk? I plan on going in and moving everything out as fast as humanely possible. He will not be present in the apartment when I am there. I have a plastic face shield, two cloth masks, gloves and safety goggles.	My roommate tested positive on July 1st. Will the apartment be safe by July 30th to enter?

So confused if I have a new infection or lingering symptoms. Sick in March and random flare ups of lung pain and SOB...but new low fever. Can things last this long?	Ok so my history is this-sick in March with very mild but presumed covid. Reasons why I think it was covid: i lost smell and taste, had a cough, and a bit of shortness of breath. No fever other than 99.5-100 one day. April: went running one day and had lung pain for a day or two after. A few days of random chest tightness. May: had bad shortness of breath and lung pain for 10 days. Got a covid test. Negative. Test was about 14 days ago. Two days ago: started feeling hot and got temperature readings between 98.8 and 99.5. Have had no possible exposures since negative test-family has all quarantined at home and only got grocery delivery. Ideas: I got sick from the testing site (thought it was outdoors and full PPE) Or I have some weird lingering symptoms from prior infection. My doctor is stumped.

Bloating and stomach issues after Covid?	I had Covid back in early July and haven’t felt exactly 100 percent better. Still can’t smell certain things, and I feel more exhausted than I should sometimes. This past week though I have had several bloating and digestive issues. Almost like a minor version of the intense stomach issues I had during Covid. Anyone else have this issue? It’s could be something else all together. I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and am worried.

March Throat Swab Positive. May Abbot test negative	Just joined the group, so many experiences to understand. I was super sick at the start of April with all major COVID symptoms for 11 days - except shortness of breath. My wife was told she was exposed while in NYC, but never had symptoms. Dr had me do a throat swab that came back positive. I recovered, but still have a bad cough 8 weeks later... After a week of oral steroids I went in for a follow up and was able to take an Abbot antibody test. It just came back negative. I have never been sick like this and am now totally confused. Not sure if steroids would interfere with IgG numbers. Anyone else experience something similar?	March Throat Swab Positive.

Not sure if steroids would interfere with IgG numbers. Anyone else experience something similar?	2

Canada - tested positive for COVID-19. No symptoms but my anxiety is HIGH.	Hi fellow covid-havers! Got tested yesterday, positive results today. No symptoms. No clue how I got it. I’m 24F, mildly overweight. Nonsmoker. Generally fairly healthy. Living with roommates who are isolating separately from me in the apartment so I’m alone in a room for 14 days. I’m very very worried about getting really really sick. Any tips and tricks for getting through this with my sanity and body intact?	Canada - tested positive for COVID-19.

My oldest sister, who is pregnant, tested positive	My oldest sister is 31 years old. She’s a frontline worker taking care of elderly patients. From what she informed us, the infected patient was transported there from another nursing home on May 12th, and she felt a bit of a dry throat on Saturday, May 22nd. She and other workers were told to test for the virus, and her results came back today. Positive. I’m really scared for her. She has a husband with asthma and a four year old daughter. Not only that, but she is pregnant too, and I’m not sure if this will affect the baby. On top of it all, since she’s a frontline worker and her husband is also working, she had a lot of trouble finding a babysitter for my niece, so my younger sister volunteered to babysit. Now I scheduled a testing appointment for her too, since we live with our parents (who are in their 50s; Mom has high blood pressure). This is super terrifying and stressful! We suspect that Mom and I had caught the virus back in January when testing wasn’t as available, but then again, we can’t make assumptions, and we won’t find out until we all get	My oldest sister, who is pregnant, tested positive My oldest sister is 31 years old.

Anybody been patient zero for their area?	I’m not confirmed yet as my test results should come in tomorrow or the next day. But from everything I’ve read here, I’m pretty sure I’ll come back positive. Thing is, this will make me the first confirmed case for my town. I’m sure my name’s not going to end up in the news, but it’s a small place and I’m sure people can find out. I know I’m not the only case, but it’s America, so being first is all that matters. I’m scared people are going to blame me for any other case now. Anyone else been the first case in their area?	Anybody been patient zero for their area?

UPDATE: Finally Recovering - Now having allergic reactions (likely?) unrelated to covid 19	Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ga1vth/finally_recovering/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf Thank you to everyone that showed so much love and support! It felt great. So far I have not relapsed in any of my coronavirus symptoms, and feel great in that aspect. However, I now have experienced anaphylaxis-like reactions twice since 5/2 that put me in the ER. It definitely seems to be food related (I already have an easy to manage dairy allergy). My throat now gets tight and swollen, hives, hard to breathe, the whole thing. I have a short list of what I think it is and other items I’m suspicious about. I’m seeing an allergist tomorrow. The thing that makes it so strange is the timing. As soon as I get over corona, I now have this life threatening allergic reaction that doesn’t seem to be going away; out of left field. I’m just really curious to see if anyone else has heard of this type of thing in association with covid. With how finicky this virus is, and how little is known in the grand scheme of things, I doubt I can get an answer but thought it’d be worth checking out. Thanks!

Has anyone ever experienced an ear infection/pain symptoms + tested postive for COVID?	So I felt a tenderness in my right ear as early as Tuesday or Wednesday and I assumed I scratched myself or something or unknowingly went too deep with a q-tip. By Wednesday night it was full-on pain that circulated from my ear to my jaw and a bit of my throat and I went to the urgent care the next morning. I had a spotty headache and some chest pressure but they said my vitals/temps were good/normal but I had an outer ear infection. Got prescribed some antibiotic drops. I knew I had an issue with a filling that chipped in late Feb and possibly needed a wisdom tooth removal (no pain/irritation with those teeth, but the teeth were on the same of the ear infection so I started to think they were related). I was able to go to my dentist on Friday (explained the ear infection) and after x-rays/exam he promptly told me that I needed to get both removed. This is happening in 2 weeks but hopefully sooner. Then over the weekend, the pain turned to a fullness similar to swimmers' ear. Then I started feeling the same tenderness in my left ear.

What was the nature of your exposure, your severity of illness, and your duration of illness?	I'm just curious now because I'm starting to sense some correlations. Based on some anecdotal data I've seen, it sounds like a lot of intense cases are among those who inhaled the virus in large doses (public transport, airplane, prolonged proximity with an infected person) have stories about more intense illnesses. However, it sounds like the duration is pretty hard to determine, no matter the dosage.	What was the nature of your exposure, your severity of illness, and your duration of illness?

31 F With asthma tested positive today. I’m terrified of taking a turn for the worst.	I started feeling ill yesterday afternoon, fatigued with body chills, and slept about 15 hours since then. I woke up about 5:30 am with a terrible headache, swollen glands, a sore throat, and a fever. I don’t have any lung issues right now, other than a little mucus and it hurts to breathe. I went to the ER and tested positive. I am terrified. I have a history of bronchial asthma and relative issues. I was trying to be safe because of this and I honestly have no clue where I got it, maybe target. I’m worried about it going into my lungs and ending up on a respirator.

Recurring Sinus issues?	"I have never been tested. The very first week in April, I was down for the count. Started with basic GI issues and fatigue; but by the end of the week, I had spent almost 4 days sleeping ~20 hours with a low grade fever. (Idk if it's actually low grade for me since I usually temp at 97.6° instead of 98.6°. but either way, I never broke 100°.) The last day, I was in literal tears because my chest hurt so bad, but never had a cough or mucus. And that night, my fever broke. I felt basically recovered after 3 or 4 days. But since then, I've had a recurring ""sinus infection""; no congestion, just burning/dizzy/foggy. The first round lasted about a month. It will come back every week or so for 24-48 hours.

Was your first test positive?	(Female, 19) So I had symptoms for about a week before I realized it could be covid. (Bad headache, extreme fatigue, feeling feverish and hot as well as a “change” in my taste and smell which is the only way I can really describe it) on Saturday I woke up with a fever so I decided I should call my doctor just to be safe. She told me to get tested and I did. At the testing site the doctor giving me the test said she would be surprised if I didn’t have it. Got my results this morning and I tested negative. Person who gave me my results told me there’s a 30% chance of a false negative, and to get tested again if I’m still having symptoms in a week. I was almost 100% sure my test would be positive. Has anybody else experienced this? I want to be grateful that I don’t have it but I just have too many symptoms to brush it off. Edit: I woke up with no fever this morning which is great.

Dad Tested Positive for Antibodies	"Last week my Dad (53 y/o) went into City MD (A walk-in clinic here in NYC) to get an antibody test. He said that he's felt fine the last few months but wanted to get tested anyway just in case the city decides to open back up and he goes back to work. 5 days later and he's notified that his test came back positive. Really weird considering the only time he felt kind of ""off"" was some fatigue for a few days around mid-March. Everyone else in my family has been feeling okay, but now we're wondering if we should all get tested as well. My Dad says he's planning to donate plasma. Also he smokes cigars occasionally, yet this didn't seem to negatively impact him."

Symptoms after recovering?	Hi! So I was not symptomatic but tested anyway because of possible exposure. I ended up testing positive on the 18th of July but then tested negative on the 20th and again on the 25th. Doctor believes I tested positive at the tail end of my having it. Looking back I did have a few days of diarrhea and feeling jittery. I had maybe a cough here and there. Never a fever. I lived life normally those weeks not knowing I had it. I exercised, drank caffeine and alcohol, etc - not to excess but I didn’t stop either as I didn’t know. Now that I am recovered according to the tests, I feel sort of like I have a hard time taking a full satisfying deep breath. I can do it sometimes and I can do it if I yawn. But most of the time if I force myself to take a deep breath it’s like something is stopping me from being able to take a fully satisfying deep breath (like one you take while yawning). Is this psychosomatic? Or is it possible I caused damage to myself without knowing it while I had the virus? Anyone else experience	Symptoms after recovering? Hi!

Weirdest most violent chills I’ve ever had	About a month ago my wife started experiencing extreme fatigue. She was in bed for a full 24 hours barely moving. Then she started having painful shortness of breath and a slight fever. The next day, I too came down with a mild fever, then started having what I describe as “demonic chills”. It felt like microscopic demons were surging through my body and causing me to violently shake in waves of hot and cold. Then I also experienced a strange painful shortness of breath. Neither of us experienced much of a cough, and the symptoms we did experience subsided after about 4-5 days. Though the painful shortness of breath seemed to last a couple of weeks until just recently fading away completely. We both eat pretty healthy foods and take about 30 supplements each daily. Of course we wondered if we had it, but when symptoms mostly subsided after a few days, we assumed that must not be it. Just wondering if anyone who tested positive has experienced something similar? No major cough, only a slight fever, but violent chills, intense fatigue, and painful shortness of breath. I’ve never felt anything like it.

I’m super worried because I started experiencing mild pain on the left side of my throat yesterday, and now today I have an ear ache, headache, and sore throat all over. My smell/taste is still fine. I do have allergies but pollen hasn’t been bad for awhile. I don’t think I was exposed to my knowledge. I’ve only been out in public a couple of times and it’s always with a mask. My boyfriend has roommates that have been going to work and they still hang out with friends, but nobody else is sick to my knowledge. Did anyone have similar first symptoms? I’m trying not to freak myself out but I’m worried because I live with my dad who’s a heart patient.	What were your early symptoms? Hi all!

Corona virus at 14	(Excuse my english, i live in the Netherlands and have been learning it for only a bit) I live in zuid-holland province in the Netherlands and tested positive, sorry if i go all over the place writing this, my brain is really foggy. I’m turning 15 this month and tested positive, i’m on day 4 of symptoms (was lucky to get tested, theres a huge shortage of tests here currently, espevially in my area) and my current symptoms include: -Bad nausea (only after eating) -Discomfort in stomach -Discomfort in guts -Life feels like i’m dreaming (that feeling you have with a fever) -Tightness on chest / pressure on chest / slight shortness of breath -Heat flashes -No energy My symptoms imo are pretty severe from someone whos my age and healthy but i’m hoping for the best. My doctor told me i was allowed to stay home, get rest and keep eating / drinking / sleeping. We also have a little thing that clips onto your finger (i forgot what it’s called) that measures bpm and saturation, my doctor said if my breathing starts to get even more difficult and my saturation drops i’ll need to go to a hospital	Corona virus at 14 (Excuse my english, i live in the Netherlands and have been learning it for only a bit) I live in zuid-holland province in the Netherlands and tested positive, sorry if i go all over the place writing this, my brain is really foggy.

Anyone test positive with just a sore throat as main symptom?	I’ve been having a persistent sore throat, mostly mild but got worse after working out and then better again. No other symptoms. But my sore throat won’t go away and it’s been a week now. Anyone manage to get tested with just a sore throat and test positive? Gonna call my doc because it been so persistent. Maybe I have something else. I’ve had strep before and that was way worse than what I’m experiencing now.	Anyone test positive with just a sore throat as main symptom?

Did I have this in January?	I’m 27 and pregnant. In mid January, (in the rural Midwest) I had a cough for a day. And suddenly my HR was in the 130’s. I went to the ER and they said it was probably just dehydration and told me to go home. The next day I developed a low grade fever that continued for 2 straight weeks. I tested negative for influenza. Around day 10 of my fever I started to get scared, questioning why my fever wasn’t getting better. My doctor sent in a prescription for azythromycin. Took 5 more days for the fever to finally break. I had such a bad runny nose toward the end, I felt like I was drowning in snot. Seriously painful sinus pressure. No ability to taste or smell. Slight wheezy sounds when breathing deep and a light cough, but no breathing difficulties. It went away. My kids never showed symptoms or caught anything from me. My husband had a fever/cough for a few days and stated he was having some issues breathing one day, but wasn’t too serious. He also tested negative for influenza. I lied to my boss and said I’d tested positive for influenza, because I didn’t	Did I have this in January? I’m 27 and pregnant. In mid January, (in the rural Midwest) I had a cough for a day.

Wondering if anyone who tested positive had pain in tonsil as first symptom?	I have been having a slightly sore throat the past 2 days, completely in one tonsil. Has anyone who tested positive had this as a first symptom? I have been super careful for the past 20 days, almost in complete isolation with my son at home. Have only been out a couple times to drop some stuff in the mail box and have been diligent about sanitizing and hand washing and all that. I know it is unlikely that I have it, but I have anxiety and this is really freaking me out. What did your sore throat feel like when your symptoms started?

I would like to know what it feels like initially before the coughing starts	I know the basic symptoms to look out for according to the CDC. Cough, fever, trouble breathing, etc. Those can present themselves between 2 to 14 days. I would like to know if there are any other symptoms others have experienced with this issue. For instance, increased sneezing, increases drainage, diarrhea, etc. Are there any signs other than a cough, fever or trouble breathing that I should be concerned with that may indicate that I have contacted this virus? Any combination of symptoms suck as sneezing, tiredness, soreness that you may have noticed when you first realized there was a problem. Thank you.

What to ask Cardiologist? What tests to request?	Hi guys, 26M healthy I had covid in April, long hauler finally recovering. Less sensitivity to diet (autoimmune protocol helped significantly), only symptoms I had was bad fevers, chills, tremors, on and off. Very brief moments of shortness of breath. Occasional fatigue, no brain fog, heart palpitations for some time with high heart rate spike, post viral heart inflammation I guess Now that I’m recovering, I want to get all my appointments before covid cases gets potentially worse out there. I’m hearing a lot of concerns about the heart so I want to see a cardiologist &amp; see if it’s safe to exercise in a few months or if I need to wait a year. I mean I did have family history of diabetes and high blood pressure issues. Live in Virginia with good health insurance. What are some questions I can ask the cardiologist? What kind of tests can I request to make sure the heart muscle isn’t deformed and it’s safe to exercise without getting a heart attack? Like an echo test? X-ray? MRI? Some 3D scan?

I think I might go insane	"My mom went in to get tested on Monday because she's been feeling under the weather on and off for a number of weeks now (at least 3). The test comes back positive yesterday. It's been 6 days now since she took the test. My dad shows no symptoms. I've been feeling symptomatic since yesterday. (coincidence?). I'm not sure if it's in my head or not. I'm hoping it's just hypochondria . I just feel ""off"" and fatigued. I don't know what to do. You always think it will never happen to you. At what point would we go to the hospital? Does anyone have any tips? Im terrified that this thing is just going to ramp up any day now and kill us. This is absolutely awful."

Severe night sweats and fatigue but no temp - anyone else get this?	I’ve worn an N95 mask the very few places I’ve had to go recently (to arrange my dad’s funeral, which was only 6 other people besides me in attendance, 2 of whom had antibodies for the virus due to prior infection). 5 days after his funeral, I woke up in the middle of the night with drenching sweats (but no temp). I’ve been insanely fatigued (sleeping 11 hours a day or more) and had higher than normal blood pressure, but have no other symptoms other than remnants of a cough I developed 3 months ago when I tested negative for corona. Has anyone else who tested positive had these symptoms and nothing else? I quit opiates 100 days ago as of tomorrow so didn’t think this could still be related to that but who knows.

Pain in the windpipe when breathing in, 4 months later?	Cross post from /r/covidlonghaulers so I can get more info :) ---------------------------- Hi everyone. I had contact with a presumed-positive coworker back in March, and a few days later I noticed this constant aching feeling at the base of my throat where the neck meets the collarbones, in my windpipe I'm guessing. Neither of us were tested because of restrictions at the time, but I thought there's no way it was a coincidence that I never felt this until my coworker got sick. A couple days after that achy feeling came up, I developed diarrhea and dizziness and mild SOB for a few days. Never had a cough or a fever. Throughout these past few months I've been having really weird aches in my body that would come and go in the chest and around the ribs. This past week is the worst it's been. But one thing that has been consistent the entire time is this sort of dull ache in my windpipe that makes it uncomfortable to breathe and borderline painful to take deep breaths. I saw an ENT and he diagnosed me with LPR (which I believe does run in the family), but I'm not sure if	Pain in the windpipe when breathing in, 4 months later?

Day 63 - (23 M) Testicular/groin pain	Hey guys. I've been following this sub since the pandemic started more or less and I've read a lot of stories of people who are still dealing with symptoms months after initial infection. I think I am also suffering from a relapse. I became infected around ~May 28 and had a mild case. My highest recorded temp was around 99.9, I had no breathing issues, but I did have chest pains/muscle aches. Lost my sense of smell for around a week as well. I tested negative on June 27. Had been feeling fine for the most part except for the occasional muscle aches. I had been reading stories of people who would relapse after exercising. Despite reading these stories, I decided to go to a basketball court around 2 weeks ago since it rained on that day and I figured it would be empty. It was, and I was able to shoot around/practice some moves like I always used to do pre-pandemic. I became winded really quickly. A lot faster than before. I thought nothing of it, and felt fine once I sat down for a bit. This was on a Saturday. Tuesday afternoon, I began to feel pain in	Day 63 - (23 M) Testicular/groin pain Hey guys.

Cough medication ok?	I am preparing myself for the worst news. I believe I may have been exposed to it on 3/20 while working my hospital job. On Sunday 3/22, I woke up with a chest tightness that I have never in my life experienced before. I am 23/F with no respiratory issues or underlying conditions. The pressure has only progressed over the few days. I am constantly short of breath and having cough attacks. Employee health at my job is aware of my concerns but is taking it ‘lightly’ and I was told to simply monitor my symptoms to see if it worsens. I’m worried about waiting for it to get worse. I live with my family who are at high risk. I was not advised to get a test (my state offers drive-thru testing - no prescription needed). I feel very uncomfortable and not well. I would like to know if cough medication (ex. Robitussin) is okay to take to relieve some of this pain.	Cough medication ok? I am preparing myself for the worst news.

Have had COVID for the past 9 days asymptomatic, woke up this morning with chest soreness.	Yesterday I woke up with some soreness feeling in my chest but it went away after a few hours, kind of shrugged it off, which I normally don't do with my very persistent anxiety. I woke up this morning with same feeling of soreness, like as if I did a heavy chest workout. It has persisted throughout the whole day. I am a healthy 20 y/o and besides losing my sense of smell, I have had no symptoms. Having this soreness/tightness is really worrying me though just out of fear it will kill me. I am having no trouble breathing, and am kind of just wondering if anyone else had the same experience near the end of their infection and is still alive?

Seems like a Mild case, just sharing to see if anyone is having a similar experience	I did not think this would be this long, tried to be as direct as possible! Sorry readers 25F, diagnosed Covid positive on 07/24. Taking vitamin c, and zinc, have ibuprofen and Aleve on hand. Day 1 and 2 had some mild-moderate body aches/fatigue. Day 2 woke up with a headache that went away after I took Advil and hasn’t come back. Day 2-4 had a slight fever ranging from 99-100.5 (although my thermometer is a lil unreliable). I had diarrhea a few times, but that could be contributed to me continuing to eat dairy even though I suspect I’m sensitive to it. Only interesting symptom so far (day 4) was some intense nausea after drinking a caffeinated tea and taking 30 mg zinc. Once it got out of my system... gross I know... the nausea vanished and loss of appetite lasted an hour or two from the experience and then cleared up. So far no cough, no chest pressure, and only slight breathlessness from going a little hard on disinfecting my apt to protect my housemates. Have been measuring my temp and had a consistent reading of 98/99 on the oximeter.

Very mild covidcase, tested positive.	Hello everyone! I am sure there are many out there as me (28, M), that has been under a lot of stress due to the constant worrying of getting sick or having loved ones being sick, so I taught I'd my experience of covid19, in the hope that it can offer some emotional relief due to mildness of my symptoms. I know many people experience FAR worse symptoms, and this is not meant to be used as an excuse as not to stay at home and quarantined and take this disease seriously. If you are feeling just the sligthest of symptoms, STAY AT HOME. On the contarary, this should be seen as a clear sign of the importance of staying at home for those who are unlucky and hit hard by this strange and sometimes vague disease, as it can be very difficult to distinguish that what you are feeling is actually a covid infection that you then might be spreading. Anwyays, I figured theres a lack of reporting on how the symptoms may behave and differ amongst mild cases. For myself atleast, I wish I had found more detailed patients stories of mild cases to balance things out, since	Very mild covidcase, tested positive. Hello everyone!

Anybody else had severe earache amongst their symptoms?	Hi all. I've felt awful for weeks and ticked so many of the boxes although my coughing was just for a brief period and not noticeably significant. This period was rapped up with a fierce uti. I improved and went back to work. After one week it all started again. Now I can't shake an awful throbbing in my ears, back of my neck and my glands feel enlarged. My throat flares up intermittently. It gets worse at night. I'm just wondering if anybody else has suffered extra symptoms on top of the frequently described ones. I'm pretty certain this awful illness does not chose to attack the lungs only.	Anybody else had severe earache amongst their symptoms? Hi all.

Mid 30s Obese Female - Recovered!	I am a woman in my mid 30s and technically morbidly obese with a BMI of 43. No major underlying health conditions like hypertension or diabetes but I do have a heart arrhythmia and allergies. I am an essential worker (think medical or public safety but I am not a first responder) and so was required to work during my state’s shutdown. I believe I caught Covid-19 at work despite our social distancing and disinfection policies. We had some suspected cases for about eight weeks prior to me getting sick but no one had been able to get tested. I had allergy symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, and cough for about a month before I got sick,so in my case cough wasn’t an indication that I had been infected. I did try keeping a log but was unable to maintain it on my worse days so this is the best recollection of my experience. Day 1: Chills, fever, sweats, body aches. Started taking cold and flu meds Day 2 - 3: Body aches and fatigue. Was tested on day 3 even though I felt relatively fine compared to last two days. Day 4: minor congestion and chest discomfort.

Positive for covid and antibodies	My husband has tested positive 3 times. Now our 2 year old grandson has tested positive as well - no symptoms for him, thank God. Hubs had a chest xray today and his pneumonia is a bit worse than a month ago. His o2 levels are good. They also did a covid 19 antibody igg test which was positive with a level of 2.2 s/c (Abbott Labs). So, he's positive but his body is producing antibodies? I'm very confused. And thanks to everyone in advance. This sub has helped me so much in getting information and emotional support.	Positive for covid and antibodies My husband has tested positive 3 times.

I think I have it — but we’re past that now. When did you get better?	Hi there! Quick background: 3 weeks ago (around March 11th), I lost my sense of smell and have been experiencing phantosmia since as well. A few days after I lost my sense of smell, I started having a dry cough, a headache, and my throat would hurt too. A few days after that, chest pain and shortness of breath kicked as well. I figured that it was just something I had to get checked at the doctor, because I didn’t have any contact with anyone that had tested positive, to my knowledge. But, I probably picked it up at school right after a holiday when a lot of people go skiing (usually in the North of Italy). So, slightly worried as I was, I went to the doctor last week, on March 16th. She told me that it probably wasn’t a big deal and that she couldn’t test me, because my symptoms weren’t severe enough. The doctor sent me home with the advice to be careful around my mother, brother and father. Then, on March 25th, I called the doctor again because my symptoms still hadn’t improved. Right now, what was bothering me the most (still is), is the tightness	I think I have it — but we’re past that now. When did you get better? Hi there!

Just got the results- I have COVID. Completely Asymptomatic	I took the COVID test 8 days ago because it was free and said “why not?” Turns out that I am positive with COVID and have had it for who knows how long. Today was 8 days since the test and I just received the results this morning at 10 am. I have not felt any symptoms whatsoever and it is unclear where I got it from or even if i still have it. For all we know, I already got over it. The only thing that I can think of as close to being a symptom is an itchy throat. I had been feeling an itchy throat for about a week now and chocked it up to allergies because it was very minor. I would take an allergy pill and it would go away. This whole thing is so strange and although I am asymptomatic up until now, Im still terrified. Especially for my family, who I live with. My two parents (f53 and m49) are in the age group of at risks. Luckily neither have underlying health conditions and have felt no symptoms either. Same with my sister who is 25.

Question about viral load and being a positive couple	I'll admit that I do have a fair amount of medical knowledge however my knowledge of this new covid beast is limited. So my partner and I have covid. My question is, what should we do? If we're around one another coughing, would that result in us giving one another more of the virus and increasing the viral load for both of us? If so, should we adjust in any way? Distance? Wear masks? Ventilate? Cough through the window? I'm referring to us living together, I'm not sure what to do when you and your partner both got the rona! I'm more concerned for my girl. She's at risk due to her diabetes and I'd like the easiest ride possible for her getting through this. Thanks in advance guys.

My parents want me to come home	Hi everyone; I’m not sure about the best place to ask this, so I thought I would try here; apologies if this is not the right place. I am from NJ, M20, and am currently in CA where I was visiting my girlfriend before things really escalated here in the states. My parents are now afraid of the government ordering a domestic travel and ban and me getting “stranded” out west, away from my hometown doctors (which I don’t think really matters?). I am concerned that flying home is the bigger risk; my girlfriend and I stay inside all day and haven’t been in contact with anyone and have been very socially distant. I’m worried that flying home would not only increase the risk of me getting sick, but also the chance of me transmitting COVID19 to my parents. My parents are between 50-60 years old and I’m concerned that the emotional aspects of this pandemic are keeping them from thinking logically.

What were your first symptoms when you realized you had COVID?	Hey all, I took an antibody test middle of last month. It turned out negative. Well, since yesterday now I’ve kind of had a slight couch. It feels like I have phlegm but it’s not a lot. When I spit, it’s just clear. I cough or spit to get that feeling out. I also have a lot of boogers ? When I blow my nose, A LOT comes out. My nose isn’t wet and no booger’s are coming out, but it definitely feels like I have some more to do. My nose isn’t stuffy right now though.. Also, I was trying to take deep breaths but they didn’t feel full. It didn’t feel like I was getting enough air but now it’s been back to normal. I’m really scared of potentially having COVID because I have underlying conditions, so does my mom, and 3 year old daughter. Can anyone please tell me your early on symptoms?

My friend tested positive, but is it possible to get a positive result 2 months after initial onset of symptoms?	I just found out my friend tested positive yesterday (April 29).

Has anyone tested positive 2 months after the initial onset of symptoms? If she is positive right now, could that mean: A) the virus reactivated in her body B) her body did not clear it after 2 months C) she got infected with another strain D) she had a normal cold in Feb and then got COVID recently Or E) it’s a false positive ??? ___________________________ I am going to get tested tomorrow, but I am trying to figure out how many times I should get tested to be as certain as I can about my status.

I just found out my friend tested positive yesterday (April 29). She originally told me she had “the worst cold of her life” 1st and 2nd week of February. I met her 3rd week of Feb and then 5 days later, I had symptoms in February. Has anyone tested positive 2 months after the initial onset of symptoms? If she is positive right now, could that mean: A) the virus reactivated in her body B) her body did not clear it after 2 months C) she got infected with another strain D) she had a normal cold in Feb and then got COVID recently Or E) it’s a false positive ??? ___________________________ I am going to get tested tomorrow, but I am trying to figure out how many times I should get tested to be as certain as I can about my status. I.e. should I go weekly for a month? Twice a week? 2 months? 3 months? I have not left my house for 8 weeks except to see a doctor 4 times. My 2 chest xrays came out	0

What is covid-19 diarrhea like?	Weird question, I know. But this is now my third day of diarrhea symptoms and I'm starting to worry a little bit. Just took my temp and it was 97.2, no cough, only other possible symptom is that it's been a little more difficult to fall asleep but that could easily be nothing. I can still taste and smell and my appetite is still present. The diarrhea is light but it could be due to the 1700 cal/day diet that I'm on and not having to digest a lot (5'8 239 lbs currently, down from 318 on March 21st, been on this diet the entire time). There are solids but every BM i've had over the last 3 days has been diarrhea and I'm not eating poorly, diet is high protein low carb with vast majority being whole foods. Should I seek a test?

To those with ADHD, do you also feel its significantly more severe during/after COVID-19?	On god, I feel like I've lost IQ points with COVID-19. My husband and I both have ADHD, and we're basically sharing a single brain cell at this point. ( it's apparently my turn rn, he's on the couch staring into The Void. ) We both tested positive for COVID-19 back to back this week, and our ADHD feels like it's increased tenfold! We're still taking a ( lower ) dose of our Adderall, but ot feels like we aren't taking it at all. We lose our thoughts, forget words while talking, and forget important things we must do, just like we do off-meds. And yes, I know stimulants are risky right now. Unfortunately, we have energetic 4 and 7 year olds and absolutely need to get up and take care of them. They'd be totally on their own if we didn't take it at all. We trade off on which of us gets to sleep it off, and which has to take their meds and be responsible that day. 😔	To those with ADHD, do you also feel its significantly more severe during/after COVID-19?

Relapse after alcohol consumption?	Has anyone else relapsed after a night of alcohol consumption? I’ve had different ranges of reactions from only having shortness of breath to having mild fever and dry cough. For some background info, I (27F - presumed positive since late March) don’t consume alcohol on a daily basis, mostly weekends. I typically have 1-2 cocktails or 2 glasses of wine. It has been a reoccurring theme for the past month or so. I’m currently not drinking alcohol at all in fear of becoming bedridden again from relapsing. Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience.	Relapse after alcohol consumption? Has anyone else relapsed after a night of alcohol consumption?

Should I trust two negative tests?	20/F; no underlying conditions, slightly overweight Last Tuesday, I had to take a short flight for work, and returned on Thursday. I took all precautions in both airports, never taking off my mask and staying away from others as much as possible. I got tested on Friday (I realize that this is a bit early to get tested, but I wanted to get it in before the weekend), and it came back negative. On Saturday, I started having horrible sinus issues and hot flashes. I have notoriously bad sinuses, and have recently been diagnosed with allergies that I am still learning to deal with. During my trip, I had forgotten my allergy medication, so it was the first time in a while that I went without taking allergy meds for several days in a row.

Anxiety or COVID-19	Hi, So earlier this week my girlfriend got a notification that on Monday Sept 25 someone at the gym when she was there tested positive. I saw her last weekend (about 6 days after the 25th) she has also seen her parents and no one has symptoms. However, the night she told me she had gotten the notification I cant tell if I have it and they are asymptomatic or I am just having anxiety. I constantly check my temp using a temp gun and my forehead is not considered feverish (im about 36.6 c) however when i measure my chest im in the 37s given i had a shirt on or a hoodie. I have awful brain fog ever since and my resting heart rate is usually high 60s and is not in the 80s-90s. I find myself gasping for air just to check if i can take deep breaths (i can), and i always smell my cologne just to see that i still can smell. I have no sore throat and i dont think i have a cough and if I do it has not progressed since i felt like this on monday night.

Feeling really off, should I get tested?	Hey everyone, about a week ago I started feeling slightly off. I would wake up in the morning sneezing with a mild cough, and feeling slightly fatigued. I figured it was allergies or dehydration and went about my day. The symptoms had been lingering for a few days, so this last Sunday I took my tempurature and it was att 99.3. Technically, that wouldnt be considered a fever, but my basline is typically 97.6. Later that day I started to feel extremely dizzy, lightheaded, weak, and slightly achy. Since this last Sunday, my temperature has never gone below 98.6, which again, is very strange. My nose is also continuously plugged which could be due to allergies, but Ive never had allergies last a week straight. This past week Ive also taken 3-4 hour naps almost every day, I dont ever feel well rested. A few minutes ago I took my temp and its mow at 100 degrees.

Recovery outline?	Hello, hope this is the right sub for this. Me and my partner have coronavirus, symptoms aren't severe. We got tested at the same time, he was positive, it was negative. Definitely have it now but still awaiting another test result to confirm. Nearly a week in and we both feel we're still going downhill. All the usual symptoms and I'm really frustrated that I've completely lost my sense of taste and smell, partner hasn't. Does anybody know what the recovery process is like - what to expect and when we might start to get better? We live in Leicester UK (I know, terrible lol) which is an outbreak area, many of our friends contracted it from the same source at the same time so we don't know anybody who has been through it. When looking into it I mostly see clickbait nonsense which doesn't really help. I was told it would be better to post on this sub for this. Thanks	Recovery outline?

96 year old relative just passed after 10 days	I want to thank you all for your previous comments and support. Tony (my cousin's father) received the hydroxychloroquine cocktail on day 1 as a precaution when the nurses in his nursing home found that he had a fever of 101. His fever went way down on day 5, he ate a bit, and overall seemed to be getting better that day, and then everything got much worse: more coughing, labored breathing, and then he became unresponsive for the last 2 days. He had no underlying health issues. My cousin and the medical director made the decision to keep him in the nursing home where he could be comfortable since there was virtually no chance he would survive intubation. He was a great man, a veteran, and a good father. I thought some people might be interested in hearing about a super elderly case.	96 year old relative just passed after 10 days I want to thank you all for your previous comments and support.

Positive and just want my sense of smell/taste back..	Hey everyone. So I’m in isolation as of Thursday. Got my test result back and wasn’t anticipating a positive result at all... Started to get sniffles and some diarrhea last Sunday and then the day before the test on Tuesday, I couldn’t smell anything anymore. Called the doctor and they requested I go in immediately in the morning to get evaluated. Day after the test my taste went as well. Day after that, phone call to confirm I’m positive. This really doesn’t feel like much of a sickness TO ME. I know it’s wildly unpredictable and varies drastically for a multitude of known and unknown reasons. My experience with it is just a moderate cold. I started googling last night (never a good idea) about how long the smell and taste sensation disappears for. And I got the horror story articles.

Need help on what to do to help my grandmother	My 89 year old grandmother is currently on day 13 done she began showing symptoms. She tested positive a week ago. Her oxygen levels are in the low 80s and sometimes 70s after coughing a lot. I desperately need help on how to treat her. I feel like her breathing is definitely getting worse but she's not the type to say or complain about anything. She has been having a lot of very productive coughs the last few days. And more at night too which may be preventing her from sleeping at night. She hasn't eaten much and barely has the energy to do anything on her own. I want to take her to a hospital to get treatment but my mom doesn't want to because she doesn't speak any English and they won't allow visitors even to help (even though our household have all tested positive).

She tested positive a week ago. Her oxygen levels are in the low 80s and sometimes 70s after coughing a lot. I desperately need help on how to treat her. I feel like her breathing is definitely getting worse but she's not the type to say or complain about anything. She has been having a lot of very productive coughs the last few days. And more at night too which may be preventing her from sleeping at night. She hasn't eaten much and barely has the energy to do anything on her own. I want to take her to a hospital to get treatment but my mom doesn't want to because she doesn't speak any English and they won't allow visitors even to help (even though our household have all tested positive). She would prefer my grandma just stay home no matter what happens. My grandma would definitely be scared to go to a hospital by herself. She'd be in the hospital now if someone could go with her.

Possible COVID-19 in February?	"Hey everyone - I just wanted to get some opinions from folks to determine if I should purchase an antibody test out of curiosity. During the second to last week of February, my SO and I got sick after our kid started exhibiting respiratory symptoms and a low-grade fever. Our kid had very mild symptoms and a constant dry cough that lasted for about two weeks. Our symptoms started maybe 3-4 days after hers started. I should note here that we both live in downstate Illinois. The first ""symptoms"" I can think of were cluster headaches behind my eyes. Then, the night before my respiratory symptoms started, I had pretty severe gastrointestinal distress. The next day, I woke up with a mild dry cough and went to bed that night with a low-grade fever and chills. My girlfriend started having a mild dry cough as well. She started developing aches and chills. For the next few days, I had an on-and-off low-grade fever. It never went above 100 degrees. My cough was still not productive and I had started to develop some pretty bad wheezing when taking deep breaths. I wasn't terribly short of breath or anything from what I"	"Possible COVID-19 in February?

Extreme nausea, hard to eat or think about food without feeling like throwing up.	I had a chronic migraine and neck pain for about two weeks leading up to my initial hit of symptoms. On my first day, I felt weak, muscle soreness, kinda nauseous, and fatigue. My second day my symptoms were minuscule in comparison and I felt loads better. The third day, it hit me like a brick wall. I felt weak, it was kinda difficult to breathe, nauseous, coughing, etc. On day four, I felt incredibly nauseous like I was going to throw up all day and all night. I couldn’t eat food without feeling nauseous. I’m on day six now and I am struggling to eat and even think about food without feeling extremely nauseous. I have tried pepto and Tums with no luck. I am desperately trying to feel better so that I can rest and eat. Does anyone have any advice? Yes I have received a positive test for COVID-19.

Should I get tested?	It should be known I’ve had some breathing issues for a couple months now. Nothing serious, but still an issue. I got tested for COVID back in July and the results were negative. I went back to school a few weeks ago with a lot of positive cases in my school. A kid in my class said his sister has COVID and he has been around her a lot. He went home for a few days because he wasn’t feeling well, but came back 2 days later because his parents made him. He said he still wasn’t feeling well. My breathing issues were improving until a few days ago. They came back worse than usual and I had a cough, muscle aches (not too bad though), a scratchy throat, occasional headache, and sometimes I’ll smell something that isn’t there or something will smell slightly different. I haven’t loss my sense of smell though. No fever either. Should I get tested or should I not worry about it too much because it might be my past breathing issues?	Should I get tested?

I may have been infected?	In early February (the 2nd, to be exact), someone I know and am around everyday came back from Washington state. He had taken a few days off due to feeling ill and returned still seeming a bit sick. In early February (The 15th, to be exact) I started showing symptoms of the flu. I had shortness of breath, a fever of 102.8, I was extremely tired, my throat hurt a little bit, and I had a persistent dry cough. I went to the hospital where they tested me for the flu, it came back negative. They ran no other tests and told me it was a sinus infection (even though I had no real symptoms of a sinus infection and have had sinus infections before and this did NOT feel like one). I did not start taking any medication because the hospital said I did not have the flu.

Pretty sure I have it, documentation of my symptoms - assumed positive 30s M, no pre-existing conditions	Sitting here at 6:30 AM after being up all night unable to sleep due to breathing difficulties. Had it this bad last night too, but eventually was able to fall asleep at like 8 AM until about 7 PM. Woke up last Monday with a scratchy throat and inability to catch my breath - biggest symptom was extreme tiredness and fatigue - I woke up after 12 hours and felt like I had not gotten any rest at all and went back to sleep. Spent about 15 hours total sleeping, still felt extremely tired. Had a \~100.5F fever that evening, but it subsided within an hour. Called my doctor who advised me to stay quarantined for 14 days. I live with my father in his 60's so very worried about him getting ill, but they would not give either of us a test and said to stay home and don't come to the hospital unless it is a life-threatening emergency. Most symptoms have been relatively minor and are transient - they are at their worst in the very late night/early mornings, where it feels like I can't fully catch my breath, but today and yesterday had no symptoms at all	Pretty sure I have it, documentation of my symptoms - assumed positive 30s M, no pre-existing conditions Sitting here at 6:30 AM after being up all night unable to sleep due to breathing difficulties.

I am returning to work on Monday and I'm scared.	I was told yesterday that our office would be opening back up on Monday and I would be required to come in. I would be working in a small space with 3 other people. I have ordered myself vitamin D3 and I have a few masks I can cycle through and use but the idea of being around others who might not be taking the virus seriously scares me.

Cleaning tips after recover?	Currently sick with Covid. Wondering how anyone has disinfected and cleaned after recovering? Recommendations are to close off room for days and then wipe every surface, which doesn't seem very reasonable when living with others...? Plus my room had DOZENS of books, movies, games, blankets and clothes everywhere. No in house washer/dryer so I can't wash anything without removing it from my house, which I obviously can't do. And I'm kinda paranoid to organize everything cause then I touch it, which spreads the virus to them, and so on. Any advice or tips are welcome!	Cleaning tips after recover?

What to expect?	I have bad english, so please have patience. I had fever at October 1th at night (38.2 c - 100.76 f), honestly nothing different than a normal flu. But the next day i had body aches and my head hurt. Saturday i called the doctor because i started to lose my taste, and everything smelled rancid, a little like vinagre or something metallic, and he gave me some medicine (azithromycin, ibuprofen and vitamins). Now, 4 days later since i had fever, i feel perfectly fine. I had some body pain and a little headache at morning, but now i don't feel a thing. My question is, should i expect to get better?

Teen Survivor of COVID Vent	(I put presumed positive, because I had it before COVID 19 tests were made). A month to two months before COVID had started being reported in China, I was extremely sick. I took multiple flu tests, strep tests, etc. and everything came back negative. I couldn’t taste anything, I lost part of my hearing, I couldn’t smell either. I constantly felt weak, and it was terrible. I thought I was dying. Doctors kept saying, oh it’s probably just the flu, and my mom would have to explain to them the severity of my condition. There was this one night though. Where I had just thrown up, and was about to again, and even though I’m not a very religious person, I had a talk with God.

She tried to battle it, but she was so weak and the breathing got too difficult. The doctor said that her sats are currently at 93% (it was in the low 60-70s before that), which is a mild improvement, but otherwise hasn't given us much information. I understand that it's been less than 48 hours, so we cannot expect too much. She's 54, overweight, but otherwise healthy - no diabetes, no heart condition.

Should I get my heart checked out?	22 year old healthy M, no pre existing conditions. Early July I tested positive for covid. I had a mild case with loss of smell, cough and minor shortness of breath/chest tightness. It all resolved in a few weeks and I tested negative. I got my lungs checked out by a pulmonologist and they are A-OK. 100% blood O2, good lung functionality, etc. No lingering symptoms that I can notice. All over the news now I'm seeing that covid causes permanent heart damage &amp; myocarditis even in mild cases, that healthy young athletes are dropping dead from heart attacks, etc. I'm looking to get back into running and working out but now I'm concerned I could... drop dead or something. Even though I have no symptoms at all and according to my Fitbit my resting heart rate is great (low 50's). Is getting my heart checked out by a cardiologist even though I feel 100% normal overkill?

I have a constant head for 2 weeks. All of April weird dreams and waking up sweating April 21st Heartbeat won’t go below 130. I go to ER. Spinal tap and CT are performed and I am sent home. Extreme constipation starts. April 24th- weird burning in nose and my mouth goes dry. For the past week no matter how much I drink I can’t stay hydrated and I urinate all day. My body temperature is low (97) when it is usually 98.6, extreme fatigue and blood pressure getting lower. I went to urgent care and had normal kidney function and I am not dehydrated. I am extremely scared of these symptoms. Anyone else have these?	Weird symptoms Here is my timeline. I never tested positive but had a negative PCR test 4 weeks after all this started.

Fast heart rate - tachycardia - cases where it’s resolved?	This sub has kept me sane during uncertain and worrying times! Thanks to all contributors. 47m, Type 1 diabetes - good control. Prior to this worked out/cardio 5-6 times per week (lifetime habit). Won’t give a full breakdown of my timeline here but in summary: essentially mild, no cough, lots of GI esp week 2, aching and exhaustion, fever now gone for a couple of weeks. For 2 days in week 2 my HR slowed down noticeably. Now on Day 33. Palpitations started a few days ago. Noticed HR goes up to 130 eg even if I’m just wiping down a surface with a bit of effort and I get out of breath. I get totally wiped out. It all seems never ending. I’ve noticed many similar anecdotes here but am very interested to hear where anyone has experienced similar but symptoms have eased or resolved. I could ask my doctor but, frankly, this sub is weeks ahead of most medical professionals in highlighting symptoms. Thanks in advance!	Fast heart rate - tachycardia - cases where it’s resolved?

Breathing trouble	Question please - What were your breathing symptoms, how long did they last, and did you fully recover from your breathing symptoms? As an added bonus, when did they start? For example, Day x was breathlessness, shortness of breath, lung pain, etc. and it recovered on Day Y most of the way or completely or ... [be descriptive so others understand]. For added context — I’m on Day 7 and wondering what to expect with my breathing issues. I really appreciate you guys.

When should I worry about chest pain?	"For background: 29F, 175lbs, 5'10"". Former smoker. I tested positive a week ago today. I'm on day 14ish and I feel a lot better. The highest my temp ever got was 99.8 and my spO2 has been consistently in the 98-100 range. HR is a little high at around 80-90. Haven't really had any respiratory symptoms aside from a dryish tickle and cough that comes and goes (that could easily be allergy related). Two nights ago I suddenly developed some sharp, charlie-horse like pain in my left shoulder that seemed to wrap around my left side and go near my chest. It only hurts upon breathing deeply, laughing, or quick/odd movement. Doesn't hurt when I cough or sneeze. Right side is completely unaffected. My only option for care is the ER and I really do not want to go there unless I absolutely have to."	"When should I worry about chest pain? For background: 29F, 175lbs, 5'10"". Former smoker.

Had shortness of breath for a couple of days.	So back in mid April my throat started feeling funny and I would gargle with salt water a few times until it went away, few days later I couldn't breath right, felt like I needed more oxygen with every breath for a few days. No other symptoms. When I went to the ER they did x-rays and ekg + bloodwork and everything seemed fine so they didn't test me due to test shortages and gave me an inhaler. Anyone tested positive with just these symptoms?	Had shortness of breath for a couple of days.

Tongue/Mouth Pain	I recently got tested positive for Covid. Most of all the symptoms have passed except now I have a really sore tongue that appears to have some dark red fungi/bacteria on it that has been present since I first got sick. Worrying me because it won’t go away. It has a burning feeling normally, especially when I’m eating and food touches the top of my tongue. Any ideas?

One of my newborn twins has just tested positive. Born 10 weeks premature, still in NICU and only 8 weeks old.	We are not allowed to see them. Awaiting news if we can be tested. We’ve had no symptoms and her only symptoms currently are upset tummy, runny nose and reduced appetite. No fever, cough, they can’t tell us if their throats are sore obviously. Her twin sister tested negative - but she’s been having feeding issues for 10 days and I actually just started a dairy free diet as her consultant though it could be diet related. We don’t know if she’s already had it, and they’re nearing the end - or if she will test positive in three days. I am sick with worry. Worried we’re about to get it (OH has asthma), worried I cant see my babies and comfort them when they are unwell. They have chronic lung disease of prematurity. No one has any answers.

Lost my dad this week :(	Just posting the final, unfortunate update on my dad. After suffering through two collapsed lungs and more secondary infections my dad finally died peacefully on Wednesday June 3. He's gone way too soon at age 68, he hadn't even retired yet. I have a lot of anger about this entire situation and journey at just about every level but for now we are trying to celebrate his amazing life and find our new way forward without him somehow. He was the cornerstone of our whole family and of so many organizations in our community. Thanks to everybody who read my previous posts and contacted me, my family followed along and all the supportive comments we received really meant a lot to us - and we also used the medical suggestions in our discussions with his care team. We are heartbroken and devastated but we know that there are thousands of other families across the country and the world who know how we feel right now :(	Lost my dad this week :( Just posting the final, unfortunate update on my dad.

Can employer require you to show results?	Developed symptoms last week. Video chatted with doctor and he gave me a presumed positive doctors note and said we are awaiting test results in the note. I live in Iowa and we have a 3rd party tester here ( TestIowa, they are terrible). Anyway, I got my results back via email with a login to a portal to view results and was told to call my doctor with results. My doctor says they can’t write me a Covid positive note since the test was through a third party. My work is now requesting me to send my Covid results via picture which I am not at all comfortable with due to privacy reasons. Can they penalize me for not sending them?

Ex smoker - Lungs cleaning up or possibly Covid? I’m really anxious and scared of dead.	I’m asking because I have no idea if I have or not this virus. It’s impossible as in my country the tests are limited to 60+ years old people or people with severe conditions. I sometimes feel something weird in my chest but not shortness of breath, something weird sometimes when I breath like in my heart? Idk how to explain it and I induce phlegm out of my throat and also feel a sore throat every now and then. I feel so scared, I have pre-diabetes and I’m 26Yo and I’m also pre obese and I’m scared of dead. I’m an only child and I support my family and if I die who’s gonna be responsible for them I need to live! I have always been a little bit paranoid/hypochondriac but now I’m scared AF. I don’t want to wake up dead or with a fatal heart attack or something else. Please, someone tell me this is normal because I also stopped smoking weed when this pandemic started just to get a little bit more healthy.

My experience so far. Confirmed positive, possibly day 6 or 7.	22nd March: Super itchy throat! Like something was tickling me and forcing me to cough to relieve the itch. No other symptoms. 23rd March: Itchy throat and cough, developed a fever of 37.9 in the afternoon. Swab test done at 4pm. 24th March: 10am confirmed positive. Admitted to hospital. I live in a country where every positive case is isolated in the hospital, no matter mild or severe. No more fever, cough subsiding with cough syrup. 25th March: No fever and cough although swab test confirms still negative. 26th March: No fever, no more cough. Nose gets stuffy, not like blocked because I can still breathe through it, just stuffy, not clear as it usually is. Begins to lose sense of smell and therefore taste. 27th March: No fever, no cough. Nose still slightly stuffy. Still no smell / taste. 28th March: Same.. woke up and ate breakfast. Still no smell, no taste. I am lucky that my symptoms are mild and I am feeling really fine! It’s just the loss of smell and taste that’s really frustrating (day 3 of this). Read that it takes 7-14 days to come back. I will update on this as I’ve seen many	My experience so far.

Did anybody start with shortness of breath and tightness in chest?	I have been really worried lately because this all started a week ago. I woke up 8 nights ago to intense pain in my chest with rapid pounding heart beat and pain in my left arm. This all lasted for like 3 minutes. Got worried it was a mild heart attack and my mom looked up stuff and said it was most likely a panic attack. The next morning, I had no inclination to eat and I felt nauseous. Tightness kept switching from left to right and sometimes in the middle of my chest. ( I have clinical anxiety and exercise induced asthma). I’ve had some tickling feeling in my throat from time to time. And I also have some aches mostly on my right side under my shoulder blade. I am 6’2”, 185 pounds, and 19 years old. I might be overreacting, but I would like to know what kind of stuff related to the chest that people are experiencing from the beginning.

What is working for me.	A bit of background on my (m28) situation. I first got it in mid-march and have been suffering ever since in intervals. The original symptoms I got were mild and I was able to work all of the way through until my first recovery. Not knowing anything about how exertion affect the body after Covid I went ahead and quickly resumed my workout schedule which triggered a relapse. I have since had a couple more relapses, each coming after me attempting to resume exercising. Symptoms of the relapses include feeling my heart beating constantly as if I just stopped running, headaches and general tiredness (napping during the day a lot). Also my sense of smell has only returned to about 20% of what it used to be and seems to have plateaued. Can't smell burnt bacon or cleaning chemicals. Also after the last relapse I started having heart aches. I guess the muscle was just starting to get tired after working overtime for so long, or perhaps the immune system started attacking the heart. Who knows. Either way, this is not the first time I am having a long recovery after a viral infection. A couple of years back I	What is working for me. A bit of background on my (m28) situation.

Had a sinus infection a few weeks ago, got pink eye last week and developed a fever today	Hey all. I’ve (M22) posted in here before, and I’m posting here again—I’ve had a wide variety of things happening to my body and I just want to make sure it’s nothing (or see if it’s something) I should worry about. A few weeks ago I was having awful headaches for two weeks straight, and my teeth were hurting. I had a telehealth visit with a clinic and they diagnosed me with a sinus infection, gave me antibiotics, which didn’t help much at all—I never ended up finishing them but a few days after I stopped taking them my headaches went away (for the most part). About a week later I woke up with pink eye randomly, went to the clinic for an in person visit and was told that it was viral, and that it was very common after having a sinus infection and not to be surprised if it happened in my other eye. It didn’t, and within a few days it cleared up on its own. Throughout all of this, my wisdom teeth decided now was a *great* time to start bothering me. I was told at the dentist in March that they were growing in and	Had a sinus infection a few weeks ago, got pink eye last week and developed a fever today Hey all.

Asking for my girlfriend that is tested positive and wishes to return back to work. Shes a nurse.	Hi everyone, my girlfriend was tested positive in late march. (Around 20+/03/2020 i think?). Shes a nurse from a hospital that has quite a significant number of covid19 patients. Last month, she was discharged from hospital after receiving 2 consecutive negative results. Now, a month later, the hospital wants her to come back for work. I am very worried about her as shes still having some chest pains that is mild but she told me she tried exercising and have no SOB or severe chest pain. That means shes not fully recovered right? My question is, is it safe for her to return back to the hospital for work? Theres a chance she has antibodies right and wont easily be reinfected?

Anyone still waiting for their sense of smell to come back?	It's been about month+ and my sense of smell is still at like 10%. My right nostril feels like it can smell at 10% capacity but my left nostril feels like it's at 5% capacity. Has anyone experience something like this before? I can only smell if I bring them real close. Somedays have been better than other though, one day I remember being able to smell the breakfast my family was cooking. Today I can barely smell the bayleafs from the tree outside. This is really depressing me and I'd like to here if someone has had a similar experience.

False negative?	I live with my Grandma. Last Thursday she was feeling awful could hardly get out of bed she had a sore throat, chest pain, slight fever, congestion, headaches, ect.

Contact tracing	I tested positive for COVID-19 on July 30. Today, August 23, I just got a contact tracing call from my state’s (South Carolina) department of health. Thankfully, I was responsible enough to let everyone I came into contact with about my diagnosis so they could take precautions. But a contact tracing call three weeks later seems like such a delayed response/waste of resources. What have your experiences been? Are there any states out there that are actually handling contact tracing well?	Contact tracing I tested positive for COVID-19 on July 30.

I (M28) tested positive &gt;1 month ago, here's my story.	"Sup reddit fam, hope you're doing well and stayin' classy. Here's my schpeel. I'm 28, active &amp; healthy, weightlifter, BW before sickness was 205lb with about 16, 17% body fat. Day 1: Initial exposure. Helped a friend working in his shop and ate dinner with him. He got tested regularly for work and stayed by himself, so I figured we were good - I was wrong. Day 3-4: I was notified by Mr. X that he tested positive. I tried to get a test but couldn't. I went run that night (live out in the country, nobody around, don't worry) and felt like I got winded The following morning, I felt... ""off."" Not bad, just... ""Off."" Went get a test; they had rapid nose molecular tests, it was negative, cool. Day 5: I DEFINITELY don't feel good. But again - I don't feel awful. Just really fatigued, and I have some sinus congestion. Day 6: I feel like Day 5. Fatigued and some sinus pressure/congestion. I go take another test. Told my family what was up (I was staying with parents &amp; kid brother while my wife was away for work). Day 7-17: I feel better and better each day."

Tested positive then negative and now no antibodies	Hi all, Just wondering your thoughts. On Aug. 4, I tested positive. I was asymptotic and only got tested bc I wanted to visit my dad who is in his 70s. On the caution spectrum, I’d say I lean toward “overly cautious”, so I found the results hard to believe. Esp when my partner tested negative, twice, and she’s the essential employee. Five days later, I went back for test bc I just couldn’t believe it (mind you, I was still isolating, minus getting the 2nd test). Second test came back negative. I still continues to isolate for 10 days + 4 more quarantined. I went for an antibody test yesterday and it came back negative. So, do you think it was a false positive? Other thoughts?

Tested positive for Covid-19 Antibodies. My symptoms while sick were treated with these medications successfully. I only had to miss a little bit of work.	Covid-19 seems to hit everyone in different ways so I wanted to talk about what symptoms I did have and how medication for pleurisy helped it not be too terrible. If you are suffering from similar symptoms then ask your doctor about steroids. Health history: I'm 38 and never had pneumonia in my life. I got the flu shot this year and got sick a few times but usually, I don't have any lingering effects. No underlining health conditions. A- blood type. Initial sickness: March 10th - Lasted about 3-4 days. I felt pretty crummy like I was coming down with another cold. I already had 2 colds this flu season so it was annoying I was sick AGAIN. No coughing, no fever, never lost my sense of taste or smell. The main symptoms were a super sore throat and weakness. At the time I was sick two of my co-workers who sat next to me were also sick.

Anyone else biting your lip?	I know that this probably sounds like a joke, but my boyfriend and I are genuinely curious. Has anyone else experienced biting your bottom lip? He and I have both experienced this when we both got Covid. Neither of us do this normally. We are wondering if it was some sort of response to the symptoms or something to do with breathing through your mouth more often.	Anyone else biting your lip?

Headache won’t go away	Hi! I’m 21yrs old and woke up yesterday (July 11) feeling completely fine. Around 10pm after doing a few chores my head hurt and I feel a bit warm. I experience the bags on my eye getting a bit swollen and puffy so I thought I was having a fever. I checked my temperature and it was just around 36 degrees. Went to bed around 3am and woke up at 12noon still with headache and feels tired. I tried drinking paracetamol twice but it didn’t take away the headache. I experience mild runny nose this week but not consistent and no sore throat or dry cough so far. I checked my temperature again today (July 12) before going to bed but it still remains at around 36 degrees) I’m thinking if this is just connected to the weather &amp; sinusitis? or if these are symptoms of Covid? What extra precautionary measures should I take from this day? I am worried bcos we have a 6 month old baby in the house and my mom is pregnant. I also share a room with my brother. Please help.

Should I self-quarantine?	So I spent the last weekend (Saturday, Friday) with friends, we took airbnb and hiked together. At Saturday afternoon, while hiking, we received a call telling two of my friends might need to quarantine because they had spent time at the beach on Wednesday with someone that was exposed to someone with corona at Tuesday. Apparently that person has fever and so we decided to split up and go home in the middle of hiking. At Sunday we received the news that the person with the fever has corona so two of my friends are now quarantined. I came back home, my boss told me to work from home for now. So I'm home and I didn't quarantine myself from Saturday night untill now (Tuesday), and I'm kinda skeptical I have corona too. But the problem is that healthcare refuses to test me since I wasn't in direct contact with someone with corona and my quarantined friends are not tested too because they show no symptoms and therefore healthcare refuse to test them too (and they refuse to lie about symptoms to get tested). So, I'm with my family at home (Mom, sister and our cat), and I have mixed	Should I self-quarantine? So I spent the last weekend (Saturday, Friday) with friends, we took airbnb and hiked together.

Pretty mild case so far	Hi guys I’m a 24F who tested positive from the virus last week. The minute I showed symptoms, I started self isolation from my family (still living at home). The only symptoms I’ve really experienced are fever for the first day and a half, nasal congestion, headache and back pain. The back pain would kinda radiate mid back and it felt more like muscle strain than anything. I haven’t had any shortness of breath, no loss of taste or smell, and no cough at all. I would say my case is pretty mild I honestly just assumed it was allergies. Here is a list of my symptoms by day: Symptoms Day 1- Tuesday, June 23 Bad Headache (like a rubber band around my head) Day 2- Wednesday, June 24 Headache Temperature: 100 degrees Congestion Took aleve Foggy head Day 3- Thursday, June 25th Congestion 98.2 degrees Mid Back pains Day 4- Friday, June 26th Congestion Temperature: 98.6 degrees Mid Back pains Day 5- Saturday, June 27th Congestion Temperature: 97.1 back pain Fatigue Day 6- Sunday, June 28th Temperature: 97.5 Nasal congestion eased with Sudafed Day 7- Monday, June 29th Temperature: 97.9 Nasal congestion Day 8- Tuesday, June 30th Temperature 97.7	Pretty mild case so far Hi guys I’m a 24F who tested positive from the virus last week.

Finally Negative After 13 Days!	Today I finally tested negative! I am healthy 21 year old, I stayed mainly asymptomatic. As soon as I found out my result I went for a light run and felt like if nothing had happened. I still think everyone should take this seriously, but I think that some people might be over-worrying. Without a doubt, this virus affects some people very hard, I'm just hoping that my experience calms some people down who need it .	Finally Negative After 13 Days! Today I finally tested negative!

Fatigue/shortness of breath after other symptoms ameliorated	I am 30+ days into symptoms, and over all I am feeling much, much better, except in one concerning way. Any time I do anything that requires minor exertion, I am panting for air as if I just did a hard cardio workout. I cleaned my cat’s litter box, and I couldn’t breath, and it took about 45 minutes to get my heart rate and breathing back to normal. Doing laundry, cooking, etc. seems like a Herculean effort and I’m avoiding doing things because it’s so scary. Has anyone else experienced this?

Most mild case you've heard of?	About a week ago I had pretty much all the symptoms of covid, Fever (low grade never exceeded 101), diarrhea, very slight chest pain, chills, and pain in lungs. That was it though it felt very weird almost like a dry empty illness. Anyway my symptoms were extremely mild to the point where most days I could probably function normally, even though I didn't and made sure to rest. My symptoms eventually receded after about day 6. I still have slight chest pain, but it's nearly unnoticeable, but that's it. I tested negative for covid twice, and I tested negative for influenza (not sure why I was tested for influenza but my doctor figured it was worth a shot). I'm just left wondering what I had because it definitely wasn't a cold, and the symptoms felt like it was viral, but my symptoms were so mild it feels like it couldn't be covid based on what I've read. I was just wondering if anyones heard of a case similar to mine that was confirmed to be covid.	Most mild case you've heard of?

Severe sore throat with white spots	I have a severe sore throat, gotta worse over two days. I looked at the back of my throat and can see inflammation and white spots.

What is happening? Please read this guys.	So, my father, was diagnosed with coronavirus, he was extubated from the vent after 22 days but got re intubated again due to mucus plugging. He gets reintubated, (starts max sedation again), and then is put for a tracheastromy. (MIND BY THIS POINT HE IS NEGATIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS). Its been two weeks and the problem the occoured with the mucus plugging is minimal now and his lungs are looking good. He has been on continuous c-pap for the last 1 week because they dont want to take him off the vent as of yet until something else is resolved. 3 days ago, he successfully came off all of his sedations and was extremely active. The doctors were saying hes going through hyper active delarium. For a couple of days, he went with very LITTLE SLEEP. But now, just this morning, he is very lethargic and cant even pick up his arm. He is very weak. Why is this? Do you guys think that he is going through mixed delarium (hypo-hyper active delarium) or something else. All his vitals are looking really good Oxygenating 100% Heart rate a little high: 120-130 He has plepsiela but no fever and is being treated	What is happening? Please read this guys.

He is very weak. Why is this? Do you guys think that he is going through mixed delarium (hypo-hyper active delarium) or something else. All his vitals are looking really good Oxygenating 100% Heart rate a little high: 120-130 He has plepsiela	2
Yep... I feel like I’m dying now	Two days in a row I had to hold back my very large and healthy roommate from his girlfriend. Now that I had to summon everything in me to put him in a lock while she escaped... yeah... I feel like I’m dying. Felt like I literally had a heart attack... on the bright side she’s safe and sound. This is gonna be one long recovery at this rate...	Yep... I feel like I’m dying now Two days in a row I had to hold back my very large and healthy roommate from his girlfriend.

Does anyone else get a mild sickness for a few days every month AFTER they got covid?	I had Covid all the way back in march. And I swear to god for about 3 days once a month like a female gets her period, I get sick. It starts with a mild sore throat, gluey eyes when I wake up then shortness of breath. This has happened every month since I got this stupid thing. Anyone else ? So frustrating	Does anyone else get a mild sickness for a few days every month AFTER they got covid?

Those who tested positive, how sick did you get?	My roommate was exposed to the virus and we are both quarantined in our rooms. I know that there is a good chance I get the virus and I have accepted that. However, I am still pretty scared because of the horror stories I have heard. I am a 24 year old male.

Roommate etiquette - responsible but I think I’m positive. Roommate is guilt tripping extremely hard.	I went kayaking with my best friend and I think I might have gotten covid. It’s day 6 and I finally had a sore throat and cough. I’m hoping it won’t get much worse and I’ll be the lucky few. I literally haven’t left my room other to shower and wear a mask inside now. The moment my friend tested positive I informed my roommate. Honestly, I almost regret doing so before my actual test tomorrow. What’s the proper protocol in this situation? He immediately left to another house of his that he rents out but I feel like he’s guilt tripping me incredibly hard (maybe I’m just anxiety ridden and paranoid). The cheapest Airbnb for 2 weeks is over $1,300 and I can’t really afford that. I feel strange living in his house being the person at fault for his exposure when he’s inconvenienced somewhere else that has been losing power due to wild fires. Should I be putting this on my credit card and leaving so he can return? I feel like this is going to ruin our roommate relationship and I’m definitely going to be on the lookout for studio apartments in the next few months.

Did you suffer from long term digestive issues after recovering	Extreme acid reflux was the first symptom I had. Later on wasn’t hungry at all, actually had to force myself to eat at times. Got better and had a few days of feeling normal but then I developed stomach and Lowe abdomen pain. My doctor assumed it was because I went from days of diarrhea (10 days in my case) to my body trying to go back to normal bowel movements. But after I got out of quarantine I still had bad stomach pain and went to the ER where they gave me meds and the next day I was back to normal. Unfortunately it was difficult to get the prescription I was supposed to take. So I didn’t actually get it till days later cuz my doctor wanted me to take over the counter tho the ER doctor said I needed a certain prescription. It’s been 4 days since I’ve been on PPI pills and my stomach pain has gone down a lot. Tho I still have some mild discomfort. I’ve been eating clean and trying not to stress and that kinda helps. I also feel like my lower ribs may be sore too near my upper stomach pain	Did you suffer from long term digestive issues after recovering Extreme acid reflux was the first symptom I had.

Anxiety medication during Covid	Is there any anxiety medication that I should look into? Got tested today. Nurse said she’s certain I have it. I’m on Day 42 of symptoms.

COVID after effects gives me bleak hope	I was bed ridden for a week before I decided to call a doctor bc my fevers wouldn’t let up. Completely not normal. I was three weeks fevering and felt like death. For someone who didn’t have insurance and was super sick best I could do was remain self isolated in my room for almost a month and talk to doctors and nurse practitioners. I’m almost three weeks out since dubbed COVID free and I’m stuck in bed with my joint pains at their peak, nausea preventing me from moving headache that’s making me sicker but glad I can breathe today. I’m tired y’all. I’m doing everything I’ve been told to do and have done. School is stressing me out bc reading a small excerpt gets me confused and tires me out so much. I don’t want to lose hope but everything that’s been happening and everything I’ve been seeing and reading doesn’t give me a bright hope. I’m keeping a journal of everything I’ve experienced since day one and I’m keeping track of my after effects symptoms. Sending each and everyone of you affected love and admiration.

Anyone positive just past or at the end of two week exposure?	I attended a wake 17 days ago, there was definitely not social distancing, hugging, kissing, incorrect mask wearing. I had to be there, so tried to stay as far from the crowd as I could. Started to feel sick with what I thought was severe seasonal allergies two to three days ago, but had that wake in the back of my mind, and my doctor suggested I get a test, and here I am positive. I'm 54, female and have moderate asthma that gets worse when I'm sick and I'm having lots of anxiety right now. :(	Anyone positive just past or at the end of two week exposure?

What is the deal with false positives and negatives? What tests are most reliable? What should people know about antibody tests?	Back in June I had Covid. Fever for 10 days, muscle weakness for a month, shortness of breath lingered for about 6 weeks and a myriad of other symptoms. Took 2 nose swab tests 6 days apart while I still had a fever, both negative. Just gave blood last week for the antibody test, it was negative. I know I could be wrong about having had it, but I've also read that some tests have up to a 30% or 40% false report and last I heard antibody tests varied wildly between types. So I'm wanting to understand testing options more. What are some good resources for finding out what the most accurate tests are? Same with antibody tests? How are they evolving? What have we learned about testing since the beginning of all this?	What is the deal with false positives and negatives? What tests are most reliable? What should people know about antibody tests?

Why People Don't Take Restrictions Seriously - even if they know the virus is out there	It's because of that word “recovery”. It implies ppl are well and no longer test positive. But how would officials even know that? It's extremely rare to have a follow-up test. And 'recovery' is definitely not based on a lack of symptoms since there are so many Long Haulers out there with ongoing serious symptoms. (The CDC estimates about 1 in 3.) “Recovery” is simply a mathematical formula. It’s basically how many people are now past the official two-week mark and not in hospital. Once someone is sent home, they assume all is well. (How would they know otherwise?) With 28 million cases worldwide, the stats say that 20 million are recovered. Where are they getting recovery numbers on that scale? It’s just math. So it comes down to a criminally misleading piece of data that causes a skewed understanding of this illness. It makes complete sense why ppl don’t take restrictions seriously. Why would they if the numbers of recovered ppl are so high? It just reinforces that ppl get better quickly and all these inconvenient measures are over-the-top and unnecessary. What do you think?

I’m a fellow longhauler having ongoing symptoms since late March. It’ll be 11 weeks Saturday but I never had a cough, just an *extremely* tight chest along with swollen throat and bronchial tubes. Does this mean I may have avoided lung damage??	My lungs never burned or hurt and I didn’t feel compelled to cough or anything. It seems my tight chest is from the bronchial tubes being inflamed and producing a lot of mucus and causing wheezing. My pulse ox has been at 97 or 98 consistently. I do feel SOB but I think it’s mostly just in my head because I get really bad anxiety and having a tight chest makes me feel like I’m suffocating. I thought I was going to die a few times during bad flare ups because of how tight my chest was but my pulse ox will be 96 during these bad instances. Then it’ll ease up a few hours later and I’m back to 98 with only a little bit of chest pressure. So did I avoid getting the virus in my lungs? Do my symptoms suggest I avoided lung damage? It seems like if my bronchitis type symptoms eased up I’d be 90% back to normal.. I‘d still have head pressure, sinus pressure and mild throat swelling though (these symptoms reappeared 2 weeks ago during a relapse but they are improving slowly).

I wish I was making this up. 6 people in my extended family and circle have died in the last 6 weeks, 5 of them from COVID-19.	The first was a cousin's husband. A man in his 60's, otherwise healthy. Went to the hospital and died the next day. Then it was another cousin's aunt (from the other side of my family), who wasn't related to us but we knew her and liked her well enough. She was in her 80's, lasted about week in the hospital. The third was my mom's uncle from one side of the family. He didn't die from COVID, but from cancer. Meanwhile, his son was in another city, battling COVID-19 in the ICU. Afterwards, my mom's aunt from the other side of her family died from COVID-19 at the hospital. A woman in her 80's, she told her daughter she didn't want to be cremated, but alas. The next week, my mom's cousin (the one in the ICU) died. He was in his 60's, overweight but otherwise healthy. The day before yesterday, just as I was thinking that finally the streak was over, I got a call from my sister. My mom's right hand at work, who we all knew and were friends with, was found dead in her apartment. She was about my age, so early 30s at most. Obese.

Month 5, unfortunately still sick	"I said last month I'd post for the next month. Probably will be doing that until I can type out a ""recovered"" post or until I personally feel posting is losing its value in contributing to this subreddit. If you have any questions, please look at posting &amp; comment history in this sub. I'm posting this for informational purposes and am not seeking advice in any form. Kinda getting the feeling that I'm dealing with some sort of autoimmune issue kickstarted by COVID, or something along those lines. I don't want to talk about this like it's commonplace for COVID - I'm in the minority of those that get sick. Please don't get anxious about it.

Has anyone had severe bloating/abdominal distension issues since getting better?	So I got COVID on March 16th, and my symptom timeline lasted about 18 days total. I had fever, dry cough, shortness of breath...all the usual symptoms if you will, as well as diarrhea on day 3 and 4. However, for the last 2 weeks since getting better, I have had SEVERE bloating and abdominal distension that doesn't seem to go away whether I'm eating or not... it's just always there. I did not have this DURING my sickness, only since getting better. Not to go into my bathroom habits in here, no one needs to hear that, but all is regular on that end, however I am *constantly* bloated and uncomfortable. Almost like my intestines are inflamed. My sister, who also was infected and in the same home as me, is having the same symptoms post infection. The only way i can explain it is we both feel like we're pregnant! And nothing seems to be making it better, ie antacids, etc. I have no other symptoms of concern, like swelling or bloating anywhere else (legs hands, etc as I was worried it could be kidney issues), just my stomach area.

Many Sacred Religion Books Have The Cure For The New Corona Virus NCOV	**Many Sacred Religion Books Have The Cure For The New Corona Virus NCOV** Many sacred teaching in many religion books have talked and provided method to solve the problem related to virus. Example: the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc. You should not wait and trust the science and technology for they are limited and made from “unripe” material called as metals. You should not expect the “cure” come from the governments and authorities for they are not allowed to talk it directly even if they know it. Fasting like Ramadan will help you increase health overall. Going for vegan diet for certain amount of day will also increase health and your intelligence. I can guarantee that the % of people got “positive test” NCOV infected mostly from animal meat eater.

At my wits end	I have not been able to get tested as there are none. I have not been able to see a doctor in person due to covid19. I was given antibiotics over the phone for presumed walking pnemonia. I have now heavy chest tightness, fatigue, pain on my left side, shortness of breath. I have not been able to book any diagnostics with any doctor due to covid19. Been told I probably have post viral inflammation and could take up to 12 weeks to get back to normal.

Did everything I could, but I ended up catching it	I (26m) ended up catching Covid from a co worker and my job. We all have to wear masks, but a lot of people will take theirs on and off, and as of today 8 of us have tested positive. I wasn't super worried at first, because a lot of the people my age who I know have gotten it have gotten through with mild cold-like symptoms. Unfortunately, I've gotten quite a bit sicker than them, and this is far worse than any virus I've ever had. My symptoms change every day, but the worst has been the persistent fever and aches. My main concern is getting pneumonia from this, as some of my family and friends have.

Terrified for my granny who just had heart surgery	My granny and I live in Houston, TX. She hasn’t been outside of her home since mid March. On Monday, she has surgery to get a stint put in her heart, so my uncle came to town since she would need to be driven home from the hospital. My family has been safe, but my mom texted to tell me she thinks they likely all have it in Austin, including the uncle who drove into town as they have had symptoms for the “last few days”. He stayed with her the night before her surgery because it’s a 3 hour drive in and out, and it was an early appointment. I am freaking the fuck out. She is 80 years old, diabetic, and just had heart surgery. Houston’s ICUs are overrun. If she had to go to the hospital, would they even give her a ventilator if she needed it or decide she’s unlikely to make it and give it to someone younger? It’s so upsetting to see people say that if you are at risk, just stay home. That we shouldn’t all have to wear masks/lockdown if those at risk just stay home.

Anyone else having GI issues/GERD?	27 year old guy here. First came down with symptoms (sore throat, low fever, congestion) on 3/9. Over the course of the next two weeks, racked up the full list of symptoms (intense SOB, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of taste/smell, chest pain). You name it, I had it. Was never able to get the PCR test (shortages in NYC), but received a positive antibody test on 4/6 from Mt. Sinai. In April, I was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia (likely a secondary infection) and was put on antibiotics. While on the antibiotics, I started noticing GI problems returning (reflux, regurgitation, and diarrhea). I chalked it up to the antibiotics, but they continued and worsened over the next two weeks. It got to the point where I was unable to keep any food or water down without regurgitating it, and rapidly lost weight. My PCP referred me to a gastroenterologist, who did an endoscopy and diagnosed me with GERD and esophagitis. He put me on Nexium and famotidine to heal the erosion, which seemed to help for two weeks.

SOB question (25) M (39 BMI)	So, I started developing symptoms 10 days ago today. Started off with a headache and fever that same night and some cough the next few days that followed. Overall my symptoms have been manageable this whole time, but I have noticed I’ve been getting some minor SOB even while I’m just sitting or laying down. I can still breathe but just feel slightly winded. Should I be concerned?	SOB question (25) M (39 BMI) So, I started developing symptoms 10 days ago today.

Son positive. Exposed my husband who has diabetes.	My 16 year old son was exposed 10 days ago. He didn’t show any symptoms but he slept a ton for a week. My 14 year old started running a fever and had shortness of breath on Monday. He tested positive. I have a 12 year old that is coughing. I know they will all be okay. I trust I will be okay if I get ill too. But my husband is 49, obese and diabetic. His diabetes is well controlled, but I am totally freaked out. The media makes obesity and diabetes sound like death sentences.	Son positive. Exposed my husband who has diabetes. My 16 year old son was exposed 10 days ago.

Can the virus come back or did it never leave? Scared I might experience symptoms all over again after feeling better . I feel it’s happening ..	March 14th I was in nyc ( last day at work before lockdown) in middle of night of March 24 I woke up panting and with a high fever feeling like a truck hit me . Felt like I fell off a building and someone beat my ribs and chest with a baseball bat, I felt bruised everywhere and it hurt to breathe. I couldn’t sleep again. I was confused, I am thinking back I should have went to ER but I think the fever really made me delusional I just sat in bed . Not really saying anything to anyone.. I have a fever for two days straight then it went away. I couldn’t get out of bed, I turned pale, and shaking like crazy. When I felt better (the shortness of breath and chest pain still lingered and it was very painful) I called every testing center and hospital and found no luck... I couldn’t get tested . No doctors were accepting new patients and I didn’t have hundreds of dollars just to see one plus all the lab results bills( no health insurance) so I just ride it out at home hoping I wouldn’t die.

Long Termers with SOB and/or elevated HR - Has anyone been able to get a chest CT recently ?	Have any long termers with SOB and/or elevated HR/Tachycardia been able to get a chest CT in the recent weeks ? I have been SOB (in varying degrees - with few days without it) since almost 13 weeks now. Tested negative for COVID in week 9 and positive for antibodies in week 11. I got an Xray in week 12 which came clear. Met a pulmonologist yesterday and he wants to do a breathing test before ordering a CAT scan.

i’m worried, kinda hopeless	Heya. I’ve made a post on here before of how i thought i got it a few months back (loss of taste and smell but only due to a stuffed nose, throat aches, chest pains etc. out of nowhere, also brother got sick with me.) but i am not sure bc i didn’t want to get tested (even though i had an appointment, i didn’t wanna risk leaving my house and infecting others.) Either way, that passed. I am F (16) and live in a country where schools have been reopened. Funnily enough, they have also taken out all the precautions. This means in school i sit with not even 2 feet of a distance to my classmates, with NO MASKS. We aren’t required to wear masks in class, so nobody does. Just in hallways, so that when there is an infection it stays within the class (which is stupid because we have courses that are mixed with other classes.) Either way, there’s been a case at my school in an upper class. They quarantined the class (we still had to go) but the class is now back 2 weeks later after most of them having tested negative (some teachers	i’m worried, kinda hopeless Heya.

Something I havent seen yet	Last Thursday evening, I had a bout of diarrhea out of nowhere. Just the one time. Sense then, if anything, Ive been constipated. I will feel like I gotta go, bit little or nothing. Today, however, Ive had the urge several times to go. Still little to nothing, no diarrhea. Has anyone else experienced this?

Restless Legs and Tonsillitis Symptoms?	Hey everyone. I’m a social worker in the Emergency Department so am obviously at a higher risk of coming into contact with COVID+ patients. Yesterday on my way home from woke my right gland was KILLING me. I could barely swallow. Felt like swallowing knives (which is always a red flag for strep). Had a low grade temp when I got home and then couldn’t sleep all night because of severe chills and the worst restless and aching legs. Went to urgent care this morning where they ended up swabbing me for COVID. My temp was 101.6. My 02 sats were fine at 98/99, and I was a bit tachy at 127 (90 once I relaxed). My strep came back negative and the PA is treating me for tonsillitis. Has anyone has similar symptoms and tested positive? It doesn’t sound like typical COVID to me, but now I have two days to sit and wonder if I have it or not.	Restless Legs and Tonsillitis Symptoms? Hey everyone.

Some interesting symptoms. Actually hoping it’s Covid and not cancer. Looking for anecdotal confirmation of my symptoms.	Last week I got hit with a horrible sore throat with no white patches or fever, although it did feel like strep. Since then my lymph nodes have been the size of eggs in my neck. I had body aches as well, and a very mild dry cough that would come and go. This week I’ve been experiencing a lot of blood when using the bathroom. I have a family history of colon cancer but I’m only in my 20s. I’m actually hoping for coronavirus over other causes because at least it wouldn’t be persistent or (likely) terminal. Has anyone else experienced bleeding as a symptom? And yes I’m going to the doctor tomorrow and asking for a covid test and a colonoscopy.	Some interesting symptoms.

Did anybody fully recover their sense of taste or smell?	I'm thinking this virus would be handled more seriously if it damaged eyesight and hearing.

How long after exposure did your symptoms start?	For those folks that received a positive test result and knew when you were first exposed, how long after did you start experiencing symptoms and what did you initially experience? Also, how long did you wait to get tested? I’ve read that if you get tested too early, you could receive a false negative. Thank you in advance!	How long after exposure did your symptoms start?

Feeling okay stills scared	Hey everyone I posted a few days ago about my symptoms and fears. A bit of background I’m a 19 year old female, I weight around 120 pounds and I am 5’7. I’ve been having symptoms for around 33 days now started off with a dry cough and sinus congestion that turned into a wet cough with yellow/ green mucus, low grade fever (37.3-37.5c) and slight rib cage pain some days. Today I have no sinus congestion today, cough is mostly clear and rarely coughing (a couple times per day) and slight upper back pain. I also suffer from very bad anxiety so many of symptoms I’m not sure if they are corona or my anxiety. My anxiety caused me to have many panic attacks and depression, wasn’t able to sleep or eat much but for the past 3 weeks my eating has gone back to normal. I’m really concerned right now because although I’ve been feeling better for the past few days now I feel like my breathing is on manual like I have to remind myself to breathe, I also feel like I need to take deep breaths at time.

Anyone running a fever, but don’t feel like you are?	I’m on Day 16 of symptoms and they’re starting to lessen but I’m hesitant to think I’m on the mend because I’ve had good days followed by bad days before. In the last 4 or so days, I’ve been taking my temperature regularly and find I don’t have a fever for the first few hours of the morning or a few hours before bed, but between noon and 8pm I tend to run a low grade fever between 99.5 - 100.9. For reference, I usually run low (97.5). The strange part of this is I don’t feel remotely feverish anymore.

What helped you to treat at home?	27F most likely has COVID-19. A good friend and I came down with the same symptoms at the same time and then the rest of her household went down with it. She’s being tested tomorrow, I was told by an ER doc family friend that my symptoms add up and to treat at home and avoid people. That there’s no point in going to get tested if my symptoms are mild and manageable. Over the last 5 days I thought I had a bad allergy flair up. A ton of sneezing at first, runny nose, fatigue, then scratchy throat. Waking up with mucus in throat from a post nasal drip. Headache that feels like a hangover headache. Slightly diminished sense of taste/smell but I thought it was on par for nasal congestion and didn’t think much of it until I started to feel bad. My temp has only ever gone up to 99.3 but I am usually in the mid 97s and I’m starting to have chills so I’m pretty uncomfortable.

Anyone still just not 100%?	Hello. I’m a 37 yr old female. Normal weight and general good heath. I got Covid on August 5th. I’ve mostly been a hermit since all this started, in March, but my dumb luck I got it from lunch with a friend. I have asthma but my oxygen has been fine this whole time. I felt like I had a bad cold/flu for ten days. Never once felt like I needed to go to the ER or anything. Just really tired (I’m usually not a sleeper), mild temp, achey. Even hurt to walk. I’m better and out of quarantine, but I still just don’t have the same energy I had before. I’m legit on season five of the Golden Girls by now 😩😂. Anyone else feel that way or have I just gotten lazy? Also, I know age is a big factor. I have two kids who were with me the whole time who tested negative. I know someone who is 23, tested positive (not from me) and didn’t get one symptom. The person I got it from is 29 and was sick three day’s. Longer for me at 37. Just an observation.

Grandmother will not social distance. What are my chances of catching COVID?	So my 80 year old grandmother has said that she will continue to live her life how she wants. I begged her not to go to the grocery store, begged her to stay home, but she is just going to do what she wants. There are 960 known infections in my county. If she goes out and does whatever, what are her, and my, real odds of catching COVID? I have been staying home for three months and staying safe. My safety is now gone and I need to know my odds of catching this virus while living with someone who plans to just act like it doesn't exist. If you're wondering, yes, I do worry it could kill her if she gets it. She doesn't care so there's nothing I can do. I have begged her and begged her. She doesn't give a shit.

Did you suffer from costochondritis after your other acute symptoms resolved?	I'm curious if, after your acute symptoms resolved, you suffered from costochondritis (i.e. a kind of dull chest pain when changing positions or standing up, etc.) -- or something like it -- for a period of weeks or maybe month(s). I definitely had something like this, but I was sick before tests were available, so I'm curious if maybe it was triggered by COVID-19. Thank you!

Think I had it a week ago	ey guys, I'm a 28 year old male, ICU nurse no medical history. I actually tested negative, however ever since I got my nasal swab I've been questioning whether the test was performed correctly as I hardly noticed the swab, when they teach us in school that the test isn't performed correctly unless its pretty uncomfortable. Another nurse on my unit also tested positive on the unit around the same time as me, and the screening center was confident that I was positive as other cases in the hospital reported very similar symptoms. Of course, just to make life more stressful now I have the internal debate on whether my test was a false negative, I was wondering if any of you guys had similar symptoms and tested positive: Monday: 5 days since last going to grocery store during madhouse COVID rush. Wife gets a sore throat and dry cough. She has a history of bronchiectasis (aka at higher risk). Daughter gets the sniffles and a cough (doesn't go to daycare or anything). Nothing too crazy Wednesday, early AM hours at work: first notice soreness on the left side of my throat. Figured its the dry air on the unit.

Day 16th and counting. Tested positive on July 20th.	Hello all, Just wanted to share my experience with covid-19. On the night of July 19th at around 2200hrs, I began to feel congestion in the nose. The next morning on the 20th, I felt more congestion and a runny nose. I called my supervisor and informed him of the symptoms. Through my work, I have access to efficient and quick testing; I was immediately placed in the testing queue. At 0945hrs on the 20th, I was swabbed for covid. At approximately 1730hrs I received the call telling me I have tested positive for covid-19. Of course, I was scared at first, but I tried to relax and began to inform my close relatives about the situation and that they should get tested immediately. Ok, symptoms. At first, it felt like a typical flu. Congestion, runny nose, coughing. By the 2nd day, the fever kicked in.

How to go to the ER without a Car in NYC?	Hey, My mom is presumed positive for the virus. She has been showing a majority of the symptoms and today for the first time ever (she is 49) she started experiencing shortness of breath. I want to figure out the best way to get to the ER if her oxygen levels drop below 92%. We like in Sunnyside, Queens, NYC (11104) and don't have car. Should we uber there? take public transport or call 911?

What would I have done differently? My tips for protecting yourself from negative Covid-19 outcomes.	"When I got really sick, I asked myself, ""how does someone my age (21), with my BMI, get this sick from a disease most people told me would be mild?"" Well, it turns out I meet a lot of risk factors. I'm a male, with high blood pressure (medication was causing hbp unknowingly), type A blood, and an EX-smoker. Being of male sex means you have more androgens that the virus likes to attach to and spread. High blood pressure may increase cardiovascular issues. Type A blood is more prone to clotting and it is the more inflammatory blood type. Ex smokers account for 60% of people in French hospitals right now whereas smokers account for only 2%. This is in a population where 1/4th smoke. Nicotine could possibly slow the process of viral replication. Being an ex smoker means you may have all the negative long term effects of smoking with out the protective elements of nicotine.

Potential Symptoms, Awaiting Results	I posted in the main thread yesterday and today but didn’t get any responses and have seen others with similar posts getting replies, so hopefully this is okay. I’ll start off by saying I got tested yesterday afternoon and I am waiting for results, but I’m a bit anxious and I’m avoiding even touching my cats at the moment because I’m scared of potentially getting my boyfriend sick. I THINK my potential exposure was at a Publix liquor store about 12 days ago when the cashier asked me to take off my mask and talked to me within a few feet while my mask was off. I’m now on day 5 of massive, pounding headaches that get worse when I move. Still waiting on test results from yesterday afternoon. I don’t think I’ve had a fever but I can’t confirm because I don’t have a thermometer. My cheeks have felt a bit warm to the touch. I believe my sense of smell is diminished, but it seems to come/go. I can stick a sharpie an inch under my nose and barely smell it. (Any methods you’d recommend to test?) My head is still swimming and I’m dizzy when I move	Potential Symptoms, Awaiting Results I posted in the main thread yesterday and today but didn’t get any responses and have seen others with similar posts getting replies, so hopefully this is okay.

Can two people who have or recently had the virus interact with each other?	I have two friends, let's call them Abe and Bob. Abe has just tested positive for COVID-19, while Bob has recently recovered from the disease and is now out of isolation.

Day 79, fourth relapse	I'm a 48 years old male, no previous health conditions, active and generally fit. I live in London, UK. I was in Italy in February and I suspect I might have caught the virus there. On Feb 24 I came down with a mild fever, symptoms were an intermittent dry cough shivers, weakness and a trembling feeling in my legs and lower back. I had a swab on Feb 26 which came back negative six days later. From March 2nd on I was pretty much recovered and with no symptoms until the fever came back on March 15. Same pattern, low grade fever that would not go away with paracetamol, intermittent cough and from the last week of March I started having chest pains that felt like having someone pressing on my chest. Oxygen levels remained normal (98/99) throughout but the chest pains got me increasingly worried and my GP after a phone conversation recommended I go to A&amp;E. I had my chest auscultated and no signs of pneumonia detected, heart normal, blood samples showing no infections, all absolutely normal yet I had been unwell for at least two weeks at that point.

It's hard to fall off the wagon) and my lung capacity is SHOT Don't get me wrong I wasn't the best at breathing before COVID, but I've never felt my chest tighten like this.

What am I missing?	I contracted Covid at the end of June, with my first symptoms showing up on July 4th. I noticed a sore throat and tested positive on July 8th. I have since tested negative twice, however I am still having symptoms. Personal history: GERD - controlled by surgery with no need for medication at this time July 4-July 13 symptoms: fatigue, mild sore throat, ear pain, congestion, headache, kidney pain, hot flashes/sweats, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain Symptoms seem to get better after that, but I was still left with a sore throat and fatigue. Over the past 2 weeks, I've noticed an increase in my fatigue (slept almost all day for 3 days straight), sore throat, sinus congestion, lightheaded, and GI symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. I've also had abdominal pain and back pain. All of these symptoms are more severe than when I actually was positive for Covid. I can't tell if this is a new infection of something else, or just a resurgence of Covid. I have ruled out strep and mono and started a z-pack yesterday but doesn't seem to be helping.

I just want to vent about how mentally tiring this thing is	"My family and I started with symptoms 17 days ago. We were scared, not only because this thing is new and unknown, but also because we thought my parents were at risk given their physical condition (almost 60, both with high blood pressure) The first week was hard, and we share a lot of the symptoms (cough, headache, lost of smell and taste, etc) but as the days have passed, we have all been feeling much better. I even got some monetary help from someone on Reddit, which I will forever treasure and appreciate, as things are really hard on my country right now. Fast forward to today, and I just realized how exhausting this thing has been. I've been told that we should be safe as we never presented any serious symptoms during the last 17 days.

Is this a low or high risk for exposure?	I hung out with a friend last night (sat in the same room and talked, rode in the car, hugged when saying goodbye). Today, he said he saw a friend of his last Saturday and that friend works at a place where some employees have tested positive. So far, he said the friend doesn’t have symptoms (he does report tiredness and some allergies) and his friends roommates have no symptoms. My friend I saw does not have symptoms. His friend got tested and we are waiting for the results. Is this high risk? Should I self-isolate? Thanks so much, I’m just very paranoid and concerned right now.

Vent. Frustration on Day 36: felt great. Light exercise = lungs burning.	I (36f) was feeling really good. Not light headed, fatigued and no lung symptoms. Im getting frustrated because any activity is wearing me out and im gaining weight (even on keto) since this started. I rode my recumbent exercise bike for 15 minutes or so thinking its the lightest activity possible. Itll be fine. About 10 min after my lungs were on fire and it lasted until this morning. SpO² was okay though. 95% Albuterol inhaler helped for a short bursts. I guess im mostly frustrated because i will feel guilt and gross. I have a telehealth appointment this afternoon. My dr said some activity was good but it sure feels terrible.	Vent. Frustration on Day 36: felt great. Light exercise = lungs burning. I (36f) was feeling really good.

Now all that’s left is bloating, indigestion, diarrhea/constipation, acid reflux, and a whole load of belching. The shit thing is that my doc isn’t sure what’s causing it now. My horrible anxiety (just got prescribed Celexa yesterday), the lingering infection (45 fucking days), aftermath of a z pack which ended about a month ago.

Now all that’s left is bloating, indigestion, diarrhea/constipation, acid reflux, and a whole load of belching. The shit thing is that my doc isn’t sure what’s causing it now. My horrible anxiety (just got prescribed Celexa yesterday), the lingering infection (45 fucking days), aftermath of a z pack which ended about a month ago.

Dry mouth, sore throat, and frequent urination... That's contagious?	About a week ago my fiancee was complaining about a really dry mouth and having to pee every two hours. She also had a mild dry cough. Well now I suddenly have the same thing. Could hardly sleep last night because I kept having to get up to pee. Really dry mouth. Super thirsty. Sore throat. Something tells me this is not my meds, it wasn't her meds, and last I checked, Diabetes is not contagious. Has anyone else had something like this? Is this potentially related to COVID-19?

Negative reactions from fam? 😭	Hi, I guess I’m here for a reality check from you guys- please? I’m hurt by my family’s response to my being sick. I’m assumed positive though I’m awaiting results. My doctor said I have nearly all of the symptoms of Covid and even if I test negative I have to self quarantine bc of the high rate of false negatives. I told my dad and brother and they both told me I’m overreacting (by thinking I might have Covid, even though they know my doctor told me I probably do), and they think I’m being negative for even telling them about it. My brother said it sounds like I have the flu and paranoia. I have asthma and had a severe pneumonia two years ago, so I’m a little scared and in a LOT of pain with my fever, headache, body aches, and cough. I’m pretty hurt by my brother and dad’s reactions. I think I wanted support- bc even if I don’t have Covid I have something and it’s pretty terrible. Am I crazy for being upset? Am I just overreacting? Was it stupid to even tell them?

Covid recovery (5 months long hauler), watch out for not only Physical exertion, but also Emotion and Mental exertion	I kept telling myself to report back here when I recover to give people hope, but the truth is when I felt good (like 100% myself) I was so busy catching up with work and life I did not take the time to post anything here. Last week I hit my 5 month mark and having an unexpected relapse (I honestly thought I was fully recovered as I had been good 100% for more than a month.). I don't mind being a long hauler, actually there is nothing i can do about it... I just hope we will fully recover one day no matter how long it takes.. I want to share my story here, since this is where I got all the support in the last 5 months. also share what helped me, what triggered my relapse, what made it worse... and I want to hear your advice for my latest symptom ( head pressure, sinus pressure, pressure in the inner ear, basically everything above my neck feeling off, lightheaded ) For those don't want to read the boring long post: Take care of yourself, despite my relapses, I am able to work full time and cook dinner, 2	Covid recovery (5 months long hauler), watch out for not only Physical exertion, but also Emotion and Mental exertion I kept telling myself to report back here when I recover to give people hope, but the truth is when I felt good (like 100% myself) I was so busy catching up with work and life I did not take the time to post anything here.

Is it worth getting tested for antibodies?	I’ve been reading through everyone’s experiences, and it’s making me feel more and more like this is what I had in back in January. My symptoms started with an incredibly painful sore throat - worse than strep and just a constant burning pain in my entire throat. I was also feverish for probably about a week, waking up dripping sweat and all that. I had a horrible cough (actually threw up from it), sinus symptoms, no taste or smell, chest pain, and what felt like a 4 day long migraine. The absolute worst symptom, though, was the anxiety and general disorientation. I do have an anxiety disorder already, but this feeling was much different. I truly felt like I was dying and even called my mom in a full meltdown - very out of character for me. I just remember feeling so out of it and getting so winded constantly. These symptoms gradually got better but lasted for weeks. In late January I ended up going to the doctor because it had been 3-4 weeks and I still felt ill. They said it was just a virus and told me to take some allergy pills to help. I ended up	Is it worth getting tested for antibodies?

Does it ever end :/ Day 1-2: abdomen pains after eating or drinking. Upset/gurgling lower stomach. Bowel movements 4 times a day. 3-6: bowel movements 4-10 a day. Food goes right through me, same stomach feeling. loss of appetite started. Loose stools started, greenish. Leg started burning, muscle spasms. 7: only went once. Felt a bit better. 8-10 : body aches, get super sore easily. Was able to eat a bit. During the day felt okay. At night I would randomly get hit with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea. Burping often. On August 13th I peed very often, but actually went a lot so not uti or anything. 11: felt okay during day, loose stools in morning and night. Still burping, muscle spasms, thigh &amp; calf bothering me. Was able to eat but still dont get hungry or 'want' to eat. Didn't get hit by fatigue or nausea at night though. 12: (Morning) upset stomach &amp; diarrhea as soon as I woke up. Worse than its been in awhile.	What day did it get better for you?

Does anyone else feel like no one cares you got covid?	I tested positive beginning of July. I now have post covid syndrome and it is such a struggle it is ruining my life. My roommates continue to not social distance. I know I probably shouldn’t take it personally but I am. Every day is a battle for me and they act like it doesn’t matter as they continue to break the rules. They hardly acknowledge what I am going through and it hurts. I’ve had many arguments with them about this that got nowhere, I am outnumbered. The sad thing is I am fairly confident that I got covid from one of my roommates. I believe she was very mildly symptomatic. She refused to entertain the idea and get tested and a week later I was sick. And then I tested positive. Hmm. We talked about the possibility that she was positive but she refused to acknowledge that possibility because she doesn’t want to change her behavior. Most of the time I can get past it.

Weeks later i realized it never went away, only the pain. **Week 3:** Throat pain, diarrhea, nasal flow, low fatigue and low fever.

I finally start taking azithromycin and tylenol cause i didnt see myself recovering at all. **Week 5:** All clear.

Had a bunch of symptoms, loss of smell did it for me.	On Saturday 07/25 I woke up with a very sore throat, I couldn’t even drink water. I was outside all day setting up a tent for a small cookout (10 ppl) and started feeling very drained. I drank two Advil’s, felt a little bit better and carried on with my day. Sunday comes and I start feeling very cold, tired and my nose gets runny (sore throat is still there) I’m constantly sweating and my eyes are very painful. Monday I set up a virtual appointment with a doctor at 11:00pm because I could not take the throat pain anymore (he gives me amoxcillin and oral lidocaine). My sister starts complaining about a sore throat. Tuesday throat pain is still intense but all other symptoms have subsided except for night sweats, throat pain, and very minimal congestion. Wednesday night after believing I was feeling a lot better I lost my sense of smell, here I go on another virtual call with a doctor only for him to say everything else pointed at strep but your sense of smell is not common and may be covid.

Dizziness, Chest Pain, Interstitial prominence on chest xray. What does it all mean? Why does it seem like I'm getting so much conflicting advice and information?	I am a female medical speech therapist in her 40s who works in a nursing home. I tested positive for covid 19 on August 13 during a building outbreak after many months of negative tests. I initially had relatively mild symptoms, just gastrointestinal, but then around day 10 or so started getting very dizzy with pronounced orthostatic symptoms, headaches, and upper respiratory symptoms. On that day, the CDC rep (contact tracer?) told me I was free to end my isolation because it had been 10 days and the GI symptoms had resolved and said I should go get tested for the flu because my upper respiratory symptoms couldn't at that point be related to covid. (!!) On day 16 since I was still really dizzy, my PCP suggested I go to the ER in case I was dehydrated and needed fluids. She assumed the dizziness was a result of the diarrhea. The ER doc did some blood work and reluctantly listened to my lungs and told me they sounded clear, then discharged me without doing any other diagnostics, saying I should just go home, rest, and hydrate. He said he thought the symptoms I was having were caused by the	Dizziness, Chest Pain, Interstitial prominence on chest xray. What does it all mean?

I initially had relatively mild symptoms, just gastrointestinal, but then around day 10 or so started getting very dizzy with pronounced orthostatic symptoms, headaches, and upper respiratory symptoms. On that day, the CDC rep (contact tracer?) told me I was free to end my isolation because it had been 10 days and the GI symptoms had resolved and said I should go get tested for the flu because my upper respiratory symptoms couldn't at that point be related to covid. (!!) On day 16 since I was still really dizzy, my PCP suggested I go to the ER in case I was dehydrated and needed fluids. She assumed the dizziness was a result of the diarrhea. The ER doc did some blood work and reluctantly listened to my lungs and told me they sounded clear, then discharged me without	2
How to Test negative after Infection??	Hey guys how the hell do I test negative? I've been tested positive 14 days ago and yet as of yesterday I am still positive! I need to get back to work!

My grandma (80+) got diagnosed a few days ago.	She's been on and off the ventilator for a few days and seems to be getting better. she wasn't getting better for sometime in the middle. Now they're going to put her on something called Sarilumab. Worst part is she doesn't even speak English and doesn't like the food the hospital gives her because she's from a different country. For anyone who cares, she is in NYC and had been in isolation for at least 15 days. The most reasonable theory we have right now is that she picked it up from groceries that someone else got for her.

Info I received while being re-tested	I posted this as a reply in another thread but thought it might be useful to share on its own. My history - 35F, sick in April but couldn’t get a test due to being in NYC. In May - got a test, was negative on swab and positive for antibodies. As of last week I’m having recurring symptoms: sore throat, brain fog, shortness of breath when exerting, and fatigue. I got retested twice this week out of caution in case I’m contagious, so that I don’t infect others. Here’s what the doctors told me, at different locations: DOCTOR #1 (swab only) - told me that they thought my current symptoms (brain fog, fatigue, getting winded, sore throat) are seasonal allergies. My partner went at the same time and a different doctor told him they seeing a lot of people getting it twice (yikes). So, we both received slightly conflicting info. They also disregarded his 99.5 temp as not a “real” fever even though that’s what he had during his original illness. DOCTOR #2 (swab/antibodies) - Told me that the symptoms I currently have are in line with reinfection, and if I get a fever to begin quarantining a second	Info I received while being re-tested I posted this as a reply in another thread but thought it might be useful to share on its own.

College student with 2 roommates and 1 bathroom; need advice!!	I just tested positive for COVID-19; the only known exposure I have had is that one of my roommates was with friends this weekend, one of whom tested positive. I have taken COVID-19 more seriously than either of my roommates and, as luck would have it, still wound up with a positive result. The roommate who was exposed has not yet gotten tested and is not showing any symptoms, but believes she still has antibodies since she has had it before. My other roommate is a nursing student who has been out of town the last week, therefore has not had exposure to either one of us. She is freaking out and cussing both of us out, saying I'm extremely selfish, and that I have to leave the house and quarantine somewhere else before she gets back today. OBVIOUSLY if I could, I would quarantine somewhere else and not be around her at all so as to not put her at risk, but I simply do not have anywhere else to go and do not have the money to pay for a hotel or Air B&amp;B for the 10 days I am supposed to quarantine.

Temperature	I just used my babies thermometer (rectally) to check my temperature. It’s 100°. Does this mean I have corona? There are 0 presumptive or positive cases in my town. I am in Massachusetts.

Tested Positive today - 21 y/o	Hey everyone so I’m a 21 y/o male from Florida and really I first started noticing symptoms on the 6th and it progressively became more apparent that I was coming down with something . It basically followed through like this. 8/6 - So I woke up and it felt like when you wake up after a night of sleeping in a really bad position. My back, shoulders, and neck were sore and aching. This is all I really noticed on this day and just wrote it off as a bad nights sleep. 8/7 - This is when a bunch of symptoms started to hit me through the day and I knew I should go get tested. Once again I woke up but this time the pain was even worse. It had spread to my head and I had a mild headache now. My eyes were very sore too. Whenever I look around it hurts and feels sore. Throughout the day it kind of felt like I had a really bad hangover but I wasn’t drinking the night before. I would get dizzy whenever I would walk around and it also made my headache feel even worse. Later in the evening	Tested Positive today - 21 y/o Hey everyone so I’m a 21 y/o male from Florida and really I first started noticing symptoms on the 6th and it progressively became more apparent that I was coming down with something .

Just found out I've been exposed and likely have it.	So I haven't been feeling normal for a couple days, and then my roommate informed yesterday that she was positive....so I've likely gotten from her. Now, I maybe noticed I wasnt feeling normal/felt off around Saturday and literally slept in on Sunday till 5. I got some medicine/supplies delivered and then found out last night that my roommate was positive. Pain was about a 2 out of 10. Woke up today and it felt more in my throat, pain definitely increased but only a 3 out of 10. Now, what should I be taking? I've had some health scares this year and already was literally taking the following list of supplements I've had after doing some research months ago. Any feedback or recommendations on things I should be doing to kick thos things a** would be appreciated. Supplements: Vitamin c Vitamin d Multivitamin Zinc Broccoli sprout extract Agmatine sulfate Probiotic Turmeric Quercetin So far the case is seems mild and I'd sure as hell want to keep it that way. I've also grabbed bananas and strawberries and soup and gatorads, so I'm gonna try not to eat like crap.	Just found out I've been exposed and likely have it.

How long does the loss of taste/smell last? I just want to be able to enjoy food again	I had symptoms since 10/6, tested positive but did not lose my sense of smell/taste until 10/11. It has only been 4 days but I am already going crazy because I expect to taste something but can't! Other people have taken the opportunity to eat healthy but I had already been eating healthy pre-covid and actually enjoy the taste of healthy foods (vegetables, fruits). Without that taste, I have no motivation to eat healthy anymore and rather seek more extreme flavors (spicy, sweet) in some odd hopes that my taste buds will come back. I feel like I'm never satisfied and keep eating more and more hoping maybe the next bite I will magically be able to taste something... So to anyone who has suffered or is currently suffering this taste loss, how long did it last or how long has it been? When will I be able to taste food again?

Covid symptoms lingering a month later?	Hi I’m 22M and I got covid about a month ago.

So who here thinks Viral Load is a thing?	So my case of coronavirus has a likely source. My last day at work before which I went into isolation - a Thursday - a colleague travelled over from overseas (through London) and this colleague had face to face meetings with two people. He had several meetings with me in very close proximity, he also sat near my desk and I remember he looked a bit unwell. Anyway within two days of this encounter I developed symptoms and became quite unwell, but my symptoms within the first two weeks were mild bordering on moderate. I also found out that the only other person this traveller colleague had face to face meetings with on that day became really sick and was hospitalised for oxygen supplementation, after which he was confirmed corona positive. The weird thing is... it took this colleague 10 additional days for symptoms to show up from presumed viral exposure. Note that the only two people in my office building that got sick were in contact with this traveller in the office that day. I’ve still got lingering symptoms after 12 weeks but the other colleague that got more sick initially felt normal after 4 weeks. My question -	So who here thinks Viral Load is a thing?

Recovered from Covid-19 last Tuesday (discharged from hospital) and have felt absolutely amazing since. How long until I'm no longer contagious?	I caught the virus sometime in the middle of April and spent 8 days at home trying to fight it until I hit a fever of 103. I felt awful and went to the hospital and came to find out that I had actually contracted pneumonia but had no idea, as I had no chest pain, shortness of breath, and had no problem walking around. They took great care of me, giving me hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics for the pneumonia (extreme shortness of breath kicked in about 2 days later). I felt perfect after 6 days and was discharged. My lungs are back in perfect working order (thanks to the antibiotics, breathing exercises, and a spirometer) and all symptoms have completely disappeared. So the question now is, now that I'm about to hit two weeks after recovery, is it safe to say that I'm no longer contagious? How long is considered a safe bet? The hospital and my discharge papers said that I had to be in quarantine for just one week and it has now been 10 days since then. Thanks in advance for any advice!

Roommate tested postive, what precations to take?	Both of the room mates(50something and 20 somthing) hung out out of town with the 50 something years old's boyfriend who is from phoenix arizona this past weekend starting Thursday evening. They started noticing mild symotoms saturday afternoon but thought it was from sawdust as They were cutting lumber and such. By Monday both were not totally sick but not well either. My lady and I were in close contact to both of them since we live in a small two bedroom apartment. They got their tests done Tuesday afternoon. Last night the 50 something year old came into the room around 9pm last night and told my girlfriend and I that they got a text message saying they are positive. We immediatly got in contact with our bosses and told them the news then scheduled time off for the foreseeable future and scheduled tests for this morning. After all the phone stuff was done we sprayed the entire apartment living room and kitchen down with lysol and went back to bed.

Managing anxiety - see if this helps	They tell to take 'a deep breath'. That never works for me (whether I am anxious or not). Instead, i experienced, this works better for me, see if this helps. 1. Exhale (breathe out) a bit. Pause (don't inhale during the pause) 2. Repeat step 1 till your stomach feels empty and till stomach gets pulled inside because of exhaling 3. Now inhale (breathe-in) slowly and as long as you can (you can pause or do continuously) 4. repeat 1-3 for couple of min, rest and repeat. I also close my eyes and try to visualize a small flame (like a flame of a candle) far away in the dark. Sometimes I play soothing music, chanting of OM, bell sounds on the side. Hope it helps and you feel better soon!	Managing anxiety - see if this helps They tell to take 'a deep breath'. That never works for me (whether I am anxious or not).

Infant experiencing day 4 of diarrhea after direct contact with COVID positive baby at daycare	My almost 11 month old is now on day for of diarrhea. Yesterday we found out another baby who he directly interacts with at daycare tested positive. The other baby hasn’t been at daycare since Monday and my son’s diarrhea started Tuesday morning.

Husband and I both teleworking/quarantining for the next two weeks. Neither of us have any symptoms yet. If he does have it this seems like worse case for us. I can’t socially distance from my son and he drools everywhere, constantly puts his hands in his mouth, and then touches everything. I don’t know how I can possibly keep the house clean.

Extreme back pain. Muscle pain or lung pain?	DAE get really bad back pain with covid?? I’ve been presumed positive for a few days now and I’m just not sure if I pulled a muscle or if it’s lung related. It only hurts to breathe in some positions but not all. But if I move my back in any way, it hurts like hell. The pain is in the center/upper part of my back. The past day I’ve been having some sharp pains in both of my calves as well, but I don’t have any of the other symptoms of a possible blood clot such as swelling, redness etc. I’m feeling extremely hopeless and scared.

How long did you and your family have to quarantine?	I tested on 8/28, positive result 8/30 and received a call from the county health department today, 9/3. She asked me some questions - when were you symptomatic, how are you feeling, etc. I was first symptomatic 8/18 and am feeling pretty good except for some lingering chest congestion and tiredness. She said normally I would be able to come out of isolation by now (bc it's been 14 days) except I still have symptoms. And that my family would need to isolate for 14 days after being in contact with me. Except they are who gave it to me, and they all tested negative on 8/31. But she said she would have to ask her supervisor for how much longer and would email me. What were you and your family told to do after your positive tests?

Anyone test positive have slight chest pain with no real breathing difficulty?	Hey all. I'm a 19 y/o female. I smoke but I stopped once the lockdown started so about 6 weeks ago. Last weekend, I had thought I swallowed a bone and couldn't get it out but for the next few days I had this sensation in my throat as if something was floating in there. It wasn't painful, just annoying. On like wednesday, the throat sensation went away but then I started having some mild chest pain... it would pop up a few hours after I wake up, disappear for a while, then come back at nighttime which seems like the worst time. I can still breathe properly and the pain is not excruciating but it's a bit worrying. Has anyone experienced mild symptoms like this?

Online study on anxiety due to COVID-19	We are researchers from the University of California, Irvine, in the Department of Emergency Medicine and the Department of Informatics. We are doing an online study on anxiety due to COVID-19. This study seeks to utilize our previously tested Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) online community intervention to connect peer leaders with people who are suffering from anxiety due to the COVID-19. This article discuses the use of our HOPE intervention in a previous study with opioid use disorder. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/can-social-media-help-prevent-opioid-abuse](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/can-social-media-help-prevent-opioid-abuse) Over the 6-week intervention we aim to teach participants about risks, prevention methods, and to reduce fear and anxiety surrounding COVID-19. We need peer leaders to help engage the participants in our Facebook group. We are looking for anyone in the US who is 18 years or older and has recovered from COVID-19. Ideally, we are hoping the peer leaders will be able to share their experiences with others in the group. There is compensation in the form of Amazon gift cards ($20 each week). Peer leaders will also need to attend three training sessions beforehand (also online). We are planning to have the three training sessions this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (3/27-3/29) at 2PM PST (each about 2-3 hours	Online study on anxiety due to COVID-19 We are researchers from the University of California, Irvine, in the Department of Emergency Medicine and the Department of Informatics.

Is it true the antibody test (igM) tells you if you're not contagious?	So as far as I understand, there's two antibodies tests, igG which tells you if you have immunity, and the igM that tells you if you have an active infection and you're contagious. I keep testing positive for the PCR test and my doctor told me to get the other two tests to see if I can go back to work. How are you getting back to work in the US?? I've heard you don't keep testing and go back to work 5 to 10 days after no symptoms is that so?	Is it true the antibody test (igM) tells you if you're not contagious?

Chapped Lips?	This seems very random, but has anyone else experienced lips that feel extremely chapped while recovering from COVID-19? I have tried multiple lip balms, but nothing helps. They aren't even actually chapped, but they burn/sting as though I was eating extra spicy crawfish at a crawfish boil. (That's literally the only personal experience I can think of as a comparison).

Does anyone experience a sharp pain in your one side of your chest/back when you breath in?	I started feeling this way before bed last night and couldn’t take the dogs for a brisk walk today because my upper back behind my right lung would get worse. I hope it’s just anxiety or the really bad air from the wildfires nearby (I wore a mask so I wouldn’t breath in particulate matter from the fires or spread any illness) I’d appreciate it if you could share your experience with this if it applies to you.

My Progression	17 - White - Male - No Underlying Conditions I've posted here a few times and in order to relieve my mind and other people's I'd like to share my story in case anyone can relate and feel less isolated than they already are. And let me start off by saying that I feel isolated... but here I can at least be among others who are going through the same thing. In that regard, here has been my progression so far: Day 1 - I was coming home from shopping feeling sick to my stomach and tired. I developed a fever later in the day before bed and knew something was up. Day 2 - Low grade fever continues throughout the day. Diarrhea ensues, along with stomach pain, anxiety. I develop a lump in my throat. Maybe anxiety, but I made a post anyways. Day 3-4 - Same exact symptoms, anxiety most likely caused any SOB that I thought I had as it's definitely different now. I got tested on day 3, negative on Day 5, but this can be attributed to the fact that she merely touched the tip of my nostril. Literally tickled slightly inside.

Mom (48yo) tested positive with hardly any symptoms	Hey. So about 2 weeks ago my family knew and met with someone who turned out to be positive. We had tested together. Everyone had negative results except my mom. My mom was with some other people a day before the test. They tested and also had negative results I'm wondering why did my mom had a positive result . But everyone else didn't. So it's been 10 days since the result. Mom didn't have any symptoms except a low fever for a day and had a small cough the other day. Nothing else and she's very healthy. So could it be that the test was wrong?? And maybe it was confused with an another patient? Because everybody she had contact with didn't get nothing .. Sorry for the bad English. It's not my first language being in Libya Thanks for any help	Mom (48yo) tested positive with hardly any symptoms Hey.

Tingling and burning sensation on left side of body	6'2. 280lbs. 25 y/o. I caught covid back in early March with basically all the symptoms minus a fever. I experienced cough, SOB, pneumonia in my right lung, fatigue, headaches and hypertension. My blood pressure was in normal range about a month before I caught covid (118/80) and now it's normally mid 130's and sometimes high 140's. It took a few months, but the SOB/pneumonia and coughing stopped around mid May. Right as those symptoms went away, I started to have strange nerve sensations exclusively on the left side of my body, with the main one being a burning in my left bicep. It felt like I had a really heavy workout in that arm, even though I was working on my laptop and I haven't worked out in months. I went to the ER and they did an ekg and a cat scan of my head that both came back normal. They chalked it up to a pinched nerve and sent me home. Over the weeks that followed I started to have more weird sensations on my left side. I've had a reoccurring tingling in my leg, foot, scrotum and face (only on the left side of my body).

After having covid.	Idk if this is the appropriate place to post, tell me where to if not. I got covid, was super sick for a week. Then have been fine for the following two weeks. Haven’t gotten tested again but I feel normal EXCEPT for this feeling of like there’s something on my throat that a can’t cough up and it’s made me develop this cough I have to do multiple times during the day and it’s annoying to me and I imagine it would be annoying for other people whenever I’m able to see them again or return to work. Any idea what this is or if it’s a side effect from having covid or if I can kick this somehow. Also I’ve been taking vitamins and extra supplements and stayed away from alcohol ever since I recovered to help keep my immune system topside.	After having covid.

Has anyone found relief from post-viral temperature regulation issues?	I was never tested but had symptoms for six weeks in April/May. Today, thank goodness my only remaining ones are occasional uncomfy heart rate, and temperature regulation issues. Going on three mile walks outside will spike my temperature the next day, but it doesn't feel like a fever...more like my head has a little furnace inside. And I'm very sensitive to AC/lack thereof. If a room feels slightly too hot, I get a milder version of the furnace feeling. I also don't sweat as much as I used to. Some people in a Slack group I'm in swear by acupuncture and TCM herbs for this issue. Humming for 10+ minutes helps me when the temp spike is mild.

Was sick in February, now my rash is flairing up again.	So I had a terrible illness in February, presumably covid with all of the symptoms which ended in a rash across my torso, arms and neck. The symptoms finally went away in late March but today I woke up to a sore throat and my rash has itchy bumps on it again. Has anyone else experienced this?

Anybody who tested positive have stomach cramps?	For about 5 days now I have been sick. I’m not sure if I have a stomach bug or if it sounds like Covid. Here are my symptoms Day 1: Extreme stomach cramps, temperature of 99.6, slight body aches, fatigue/weakness &amp; headache. Day 2: Still bad stomach cramps, regular temperature around 97 degrees, started having pain in my upper back &amp; a little pain in chest area. Extremely bad headache this day. Also still weak/fatigue Day 3: Same bad stomach cramps, no fever, back &amp; chest start hurting more. Day 4: feeling better, stomach cramps still but not as bad. Back &amp; chest still hurting &amp; feels like I’m not breathing enough oxygen as I usually do. Day 5 (today): Hardly any stomach pain just every now &amp; then. Back &amp; chest pains are not as severe but definitely still there. Little stuffy nose/sore throat but nothing severe. Felt pretty decent today. Should I get tested for Covid or does it sound like just a stomach bug or something else?? I thought maybe it could just be trapped gas but I’m not for sure.

My parents got tested two weeks ago and still no results from Quest. Anyone else had this issue?	The test instructions said to email a certain address if they hadn't gotten results in a week. My mom has emailed twice now with no response. And of course if you call there's no option for asking about test results. Did they lose my parents' tests? It has been two weeks.

Common cold symptoms at onset of COVID-19?	Hello. Thursday morning I woke up with the same feeling I have gotten in my throat the past few times I have come with a cold. It's not really a sore throat feeling, but more like I have a prickly object stuck in the back of my throat near my tonsils. I had the same feeling yesterday morning too, along with some nasal congestion which is another thing I will often experience with colds. This morning the feeling was gone, but I have still experienced some nasal congestion and other sinus woes such as throat congestion. No fevers or chills. The only body aches I have gotten were from sleeping on my shoulder and doing my landscaping job during the day. As for being in contact with people, I was close to a lady who had recently met with a family who came down with the virus, but she never came down with it herself. And we were only closer than 6 ft for about 5-10 seconds. She had a mask on too. This was last Saturday. The only other place I have been recently was the DMV office, and that was a day before symptoms started. And their sanitary,	Common cold symptoms at onset of COVID-19? Hello.

Anybody have lasting lack of appetite?	I was told by many doctors I had Covid-19, even though I tested negative. But, it’s possible I didn’t. I had mostly GI symptoms, with low grade fever, and chest congestion and a slight cough that was like burning in the middle of my chest. I am better now, and I can eat, but I haven’t had an appetite in weeks, maybe a month now. Like I’m forgetting what it’s like to be hungry. I have to remind myself to eat, and I often get full quickly. Anyone else experience this?	Anybody have lasting lack of appetite?

Taste and Smell	I just got my results back today that i’m positive for COVID. It’s been mild (23M) since symptoms started appearing 10 days ago but the lack of taste and smell has me concerned.

long-term mild infection	so i'm torn between thinking i've got covid, or some sort of tick disease. for three months now, i've had body aches and low grade fevers intermittently. it's just general malaise, and feeling feverish; my body temp has gotten up to 100.3. my usual temp is super low (i clocked in at 96.7 on a good day) so if i'm above a 99, something's up and i don't feel good. i usually feel okay in the morning, and then start to go downhill. it's not every single day. i've had days (or even i think two weeks was the longest) of feeling fine, then it goes downhill again. i tested negative for a rapid test in april; i tested negative for antibodies a month ago. i tested negative for a bunch of tick diseases (although, i wasn't tested for every possible tick infection, i'm trying to figure out if i should pursue more of those.) tested negative for mono. i'm feeling frustrated because i know my doctors are starting to think i'm the boy who cried wolf, or that it's psychosomatic, or something. i've never been sick for this long, and in this weird of a way. &amp;#x200B; this week,	long-term mild infection so i'm torn between thinking i've got covid, or some sort of tick disease. for three months now, i've had body aches and low grade fevers intermittently. it's just general malaise, and feeling feverish; my body temp has gotten up to 100.3. my usual temp is super low (i clocked in at 96.7 on a good day) so if i'm above a 99, something's up and i don't feel good. i usually feel okay in the morning, and then start to go downhill. it's not every single day. i've had days (or even i think two weeks was the longest) of feeling fine, then it goes downhill again. i tested negative for a rapid test in april; i tested negative for antibodies a month ago. i tested negative for a bunch of tick diseases (although, i wasn't tested for every possible tick infection, i'm trying to figure out if i should pursue more of those.) tested negative for mono. i'm feeling frustrated because i know my doctors are starting to think i'm the boy who cried wolf, or that it's psychosomatic, or something. i've never been sick for this long, and in this weird of a way.	0
I have symptoms but tested negative?	I live with my parents currently and my dad tested positive for the virus last Tuesday. Since Thursday, I have been feeling unwell with major fatigue, lower leg cramps. Out of the last 5 days, I had a low grade fever (99-100 F) on two of those days and have a headache accompanied with nausea that comes and goes. Slight pain in my throat while swallowing and lost my sense of taste since Saturday night. My aunt and uncle lives next door and they helped us when dad was sick. They also tested positive for the virus last Saturday. Because my body constantly feels like it’s been hit by a bus and because of the fatigue and body ache, I couldn’t work as much as I want to, I took a covid test (PCR) yesterday and today the result came out to be negative?

Sixth months recovered, still tachycardic with no explanation	Hello everybody! Hope you are well reading this. Really just wondering if anyone has similar experiences. I'm a 25 year old man, living in NYC. My health beforehand was quite good; I live an active life and have been a distance runner for a few years now. I got covid at the end of March. I was quite fortunate to have a mild case and was considered recovered by the beginning of April. I never had any SOB or chest pain, and at its worst I was just dealing with fatigue, fever, and head cold symptoms. I did have gastrointestinal problems throughout April, but just as I was starting to seek out diagnosis and treatment it went away. All in all covid and it's after effects made me lose about 15lbs--significant since I was already a pretty skinny guy, but I've since gained 8-10 of those pounds back. The big thing though, as in the title, is the damn persistent tachycardia. When I first noticed it was a problem and went to the doctor, my HR was around 60-70 resting, but with really any standing activity raising it to 100-140. When I felt healthy enough to return to running, my	Sixth months recovered, still tachycardic with no explanation Hello everybody! Hope you are well reading this.

Negative antibody test + unusual symptoms - anyone else have a similar experience?	Sorry, I feel like I'm in the wrong thread, but I wanted to ask for people's experiences! This is a two part question: 1. Did you have COVID and still get a negative antibody test? And 2. What were your unusual symptoms?

The acute illness lasted about 1 week, itself, and cleared up quickly. Fast forward to throughout the pandemic lockdown, and the three of us would get an array of symptoms like fever, fatigue, loss of smell and taste, etc. Actually, I managed to avoid most of these tell-tale symptoms while my roommates would note a new symptom everyday. Instead, I dealt with **rashes and headaches** \- these aren't new for me as I have a list of mental health and allergy causes and have dealt with them for years, but there were some moments during lockdown when I felt like the types of rashes and headaches I got were unusual (brain zap headaches, for example).

My nose has been going off lately and I’ve been having some headaches but that could be from stress (work and school lol). I haven’t been running a fever, but sometimes I do cough (it’s not like an ongoing cough it’s like a every once in a while I cough). I’m very paranoid that these are symptoms, am I overreacting?

Mild burn in chest	Greetings from a COVID-born hypochondriac. I posted here back in March when I was dealing with some troubling symptoms: runny nose, loss of taste/smell, slight cough, general fatigue. I was also going through the egg freezing process so my immune system was shot. I’ve been pretty strict about quarantining since then. I have my groceries delivered, I wash my hands and change my clothes when I get home if I go anywhere at all, and I don’t get near people. My only fuck up is having gone to a few house showings (1st time buyer) but I wear the whole get up: gloves, layers I can dispose of in my trunk before getting in my car, mask, glasses, wipes... Just the last two days or so I’ve had a slight burning in my chest (sternum more than lungs) which I thought was mostly my anxiety, lack of sleep, and shoving food in my face faster than I can eat it. So my thought was acid reflux at best. Today I expected that to go away but I still have the burning, lots of burping, maybe a bit out of breath?and was a little dizzy in the morning.

I was also going through the egg freezing process so my immune system was shot. I’ve been pretty strict about quarantining since then. I have my groceries delivered, I wash my hands and change my clothes when I get home if I go anywhere at all, and I don’t get near people. My only fuck up is having gone to a few house showings (1st time buyer) but I wear the whole get up: gloves, layers I can dispose of in my trunk before getting in my car, mask, glasses, wipes... Just the last two days or so I’ve had a slight burning in my chest (sternum more than lungs) which I thought was mostly my anxiety, lack of sleep, and shoving food in my face faster than I can eat it. So my thought was acid reflux at best. Today I expected that to go away but I still have the burning, lots of burping, maybe a bit out of breath?and was a little dizzy in the	0
Chest tightness for 3 weeks. Terrified.	**About Me**: - Been having extreme anxiety/panic/depression over COVID-19 since March - 26 - Male - 132 lbs. - No known medical conditions - Toronto, Canada suburbs **Sun, Jun 28:** Having a great day until I suddenly feel a bit of a scratchy throat while I’m talking on the phone in my car via Bluetooth. **Mon-Tue, Jun 29-30**: I don’t remember much about these days because the symptoms were still moderate. I think onset of chest tightness and a burning nostril sensation. **Wed, Jul 1**: Canada Day! I have a relaxing evening on my balcony with the perfect breezy dusk and watching fireworks with my fiancee. I feel calm, which finally brings back my appetite, which has been completely zapped when I’m super stressed over my symptoms. This is the last time I felt normal. Ate a large burger/fry/milkshake meal around 9pm and went to sleep at 10:45pm, only to wake up abruptly at 11:45pm in a sheer state of panic with chest tightness that has now lasted 3 weeks **Tests**: - Tested negative for COVID-19 tests conducted on Thursday, July 2 and Sunday, July 5 - Walk-in clinic doctor using a stethoscope said my lungs and heart sound fine	Chest tightness for 3 weeks.

Vomiting with covid? Emetophobia sufferer	I'm a 17, soon to be 18 year old female with a severe phobia of vomitting. I'm feeling a little run down, keep getting shivers but no fever, I think it's because of the recent drop in temperature and my room being cold. I am absolutely petrified of catching covid purely because I'm so scared of throwing up. I haven't vomited in roughly 7 years, but I'm still genuinely terrified of it. How many people do experienced vomitting with covid? How common do we think it is? I'm just getting myself all worked up because I've felt nauseous all day but it could be due to a number of things	Vomiting with covid?

Questions about symptoms	Hey guys, just wanting some input on those who have experienced anything resembling my experience... So starting 6/8-6/10 I was so so tired &amp; taking multiple mini naps throughout the day which was highly unusual, but I just chalked it up to my depression. 6/11-Now, my most consistent symptom has been a sunburn type feeling all over my body, yet no temp and my skin is cold to the touch. Ive had lingering headaches here and there, vivid dreams, random body aches, and mild-moderate chest compression off and on as well as fatigue. Whats been most peculiar is its like these symptoms change from hour to hour! I went from feeling the worst yet around noon today to feeling damn near %100 right now with no symptoms. Anybody else share the same experience at all? &amp;#x200B; Ps: I got tested on Thursday, should have my results back early next week.

Anyone else having symptoms of acid reflux ?	I am presumed positive - did not qualify for testing I have been having the worst GERD/acid reflux symptoms for the past couple of days including frequent belching and a constant burning sensation in my upper chest.

Possible fast mass herd immunity for the novel coronavirus	If 60-70% of the world's population are going to eventually get it (as believed by most epidemiologists), why don't we have a voluntary COVID-19 infection system where healthy volunteers could go to a hospital full of COVID patients and take couple of deep breaths or have some kind of COVID-19 infection shot. Then these people would have to be put into mandatory 2-week quarantine with a fine if they leave the house. They would be provided food and would receive daily phone calls of their symptoms. After the mandatory 2-week quarantine, they would be free to go back to work. If most of us will get it anyways, some part of the population could go back to work in weeks not months. The economy would be in much better shape a lot faster and the Fed wouldn't have to print as much money. This kind of voluntary system would make a lot of protesters happy as well. It seems like we can't produce enough testing kits so maybe this would be a better solution.

Wondering if I have it anyone have similar symptoms?	For 2-4 weeks I’ve been getting awful diarrhea and that’s all it started with. Then I started coughing up phlegm all the time and feeling it in my throat, which I was told could also be from quitting cigarettes when I heard smokers die more easy. Then I started getting severely hot and cold randomly but no fever around last week I started getting super dizzy and feeling like I was going to pass out, throw up, and not able to see, Just a vertigo feeling. Just laying in bed my body hurts all over. Simple tasks like walking up the stairs are making my entire body hurt yet I’ve done it for a year now and had no issues till recently. I got a new scale and it read 138. I’m not sure if that’s accurate or not but I’m a 6”1 male and was already under weight at 155-160 and it looks like I’m losing weight.

They were dull, achy pains that did not go away despite whatever I took or did. I busted through my special migraine meds allotted for the month in maybe a week. About 2 weeks ago, got a yeast infection that I couldn’t get to go away. 3 rounds of diflucan po and OTC, coupled with a lot of lower back pain. I chalked it up to stress and just dealt with it.

Question about testing for covid	Hi everybody! Over the weekend I found out my boyfriends brother tested positive and I’ve been around my boyfriend, but not his brother. Long story short, my boyfriend has not been in contact with his brother but everybody in his family and myself have been tested over the past two days. None of us have experienced symptoms so we’re having wishful thinking right now. However when I got tested they did the nasal and saliva tests. They were both horrible, but I’ve noticed after the saliva tests, I’ve been feeling something similar to a sore throat. Kind of like drainage? Would that be because of the saliva tests? I’m just not sure if this can qualify as a symptom or not.	Question about testing for covid Hi everybody!

Chances of dying from COVID with diabetes and high blood pressure?	Not me, but my mom is a diabetic and has high blood pressure, so I’ve been worried sick and still refuse to see anyone because of this. I’m just wondering what the odds are that she would die if she got COVID. She’s 47 years old.	Chances of dying from COVID with diabetes and high blood pressure?

Really weird symptoms? Possible mild case. Not like anything I’ve had before.	About three days ago i slept a ridiculous amount (like 16 hours) inexplicably. That day I started getting a fever. Chills, alternating with sweats, and body aches, mostly in my lower back. The fever gets way worse at night and makes it almost impossible to sleep, even after taking tylenol. I have been waking up in the morning in a pool of sweat. The fever has been pretty persistent. Although, around late evening it almost vanishes, but it comes back with a vengeance at night. Now on day three i have a very mild cough. So mild that if it were just the cough i’d think nothing of it, and it’s accompanied by a scratchy throat on/off. The strangest symptom is just a general “weird” feeling. I don’t know how else to describe it. Almost like restless leg syndrome, but like all over my body, mostly in my chest and shoulders. Anyone else have symptoms like these? Moreover, tested positive? Is this COVID or something else? I am in Denver and strangely enough i’ve heard there’s actually something else that seems to be going around here.	Really weird symptoms? Possible mild case. Not like anything I’ve had before.

Should I worry about having COVID-19	About a week ago I came into contact with my friend walking her neighbors dog. The dogs owner tested positive for the virus and the dog walker hasn't gotten results back yet, but she isn't feeling well. The date in which the dogs owner tested positive is unknown. While I was walking my dog last week, my dog and get dog went to each other as they're friends and she pet my dog and I pet hers. We didn't make any physical contact and she had didn't cough or anything. Me and my family (my mom, dad, brother, and sister) all cough occasionally, but we also have seasonal allergies and have been sneezing too. I have also had a sore throat and i've spit out mucous, but that may be post nasal drip from allergies. Should I be concerned?

33F - Tested Positive - Isolating together	Hi everyone. Need some opinions. I started developing symptoms 6 days ago, got tested 5 days ago and results back (positive) 3 days ago. My boyfriend has his own apartment but typically stays at my house 95% of the time. He left for work the day I started showing symptoms and once I told him I wasn’t feeling well, to just go to his place until I got tested. He has no symptoms and is waiting for his test to come back since we had direct contact day of and many days prior. If he tested positive, my doctor says there’s no problem for us to isolate together even if he is asymptomatic. That it literally doesn’t matter you have it or not. I asked if it had anything to do with viral load, etc and they just said it’s fine (but I was rushed off the phone). Anyone have any experiences they could share that may help us make a decision if he does come back positive? It would be super helpful if we could be together bc all of his stuff is here and I could use help with meals and frankly, it’s freaking lonely. Thank you!	33F - Tested Positive - Isolating together Hi everyone. Need some opinions. I started developing symptoms 6 days ago, got tested 5 days ago and results back (positive) 3 days ago.

Did your response to other viruses (especially HPV) predict your COVID-19 severity?	"I am 29/F in an area with a lot of cases, and I think I had a very mild case of COVID-19 (could not get tested to confirm). It started with a ""raw"" feeling in my lungs, lasting about a week. Then for two days I had some mild upper respiratory symptoms, a low fever, and was extremely tired. Then the fever went away and it was just chest tightness and feeling like I needed to cough but wasn't coughing, which has been gradually improving for the past week. Where this gets weird is that I thought the way that my body responded to other viruses meant that COVID-19 would be really bad for me. I have had HPV (genital warts) for nearly 3 years without it ""clearing"", even though most women my age can clear HPV in 6-18 months. My doctor said some peoples' immune systems don't react very strongly to HPV, and that it can take longer to clear if yours has a more laid-back response. Now I am wondering if my immune system's response to viruses might explain having mild symptoms with COVID-19.

Who else had the sharp eye pain?	One of the least talked about symptoms that I don’t see brought up much was the sharp pain in the back of my right eye. I fet it in both eyes but especially the right. It felt like there was a knife in the back of my eye whenever I moved it and lasted a full week. The only person i heard speak about it also was Chris Cuomo and for me it was one of the worst parts of the experience.	Who else had the sharp eye pain?

Anyone notice new varicose veins?	It's been 5 days since I've tested positive, and I've had mild symptoms. Loss of taste and smell, chronic headaches, and a slight stuffy nose and body aches that were gone after the first day. However, I've noticed these past few days my legs have been feeling restless, particularly the tops of my thighs. It almost feels like I'm overstretching them when I'm completely relaxed. At times the pain is intense and then it subsides. Well I just noticed new spider veins on them. I've spotted them in other areas before, but never my thighs. I'm not too worried, it's cosmetically displeasing but otherwise I've been handling the leg pain with CBD. I'm just curious if this may be a shared symptom or if I'm being a hypochondriac?

Did anyone have a slight wheeze and that tighter esophagus feeling?	I (22M) have been experiencing a tight airway feeling similar to when u have allergies for 2 days now. Like there's mucous in my throat. Slight runny nose and slight nasal congestion. Still breathing out of my nose however. A very wheeze when I exhale. Very scared I might have it.

Share your list of Symptoms.	I thought it would be helpful for all of us to list our symptoms in a basic list and how long we have been feeling unwell for. This way it can help people who are also seeking to communicate with people who are feeling the same way and maybe will be an easy way to see whats coming up again and again. So for eg 25m, 75 days with Symptoms. Chest pain and shortness of breath. Wrist pain, finger pain, general bone pain. Burning skin. Rash on face and sides of face. Back shoulder and neck pain. Sores in lip. Loss of appetite. Intermittent low grade fevers. Sores in lip. White tongue. Tension headaches. Bounding heartbeat. Vertigo seemingly (labyrinthitis)	Share your list of Symptoms.

I know its not as serious as other posts here, but I've been stuck in self isolation for five days now and if I talk to friends they just say ""don't worry"" so I thought I'd ask for your advice here. So my story is this... I was living in Valencia, Spain over the winter and traveled to Barcelona in late February for about five days to visit a friend.

Terrified	I work in an OR and have been extremely careful about wearing my mask and washing my hands, especially since I'm not a nurse or scrub tech. (I do administrative work.) I am having a cough and chest tightness, with a slight sore throat, and was turned away from my work this morning. I'm going to get tested in the morning. I currently live with my older parents and grandmother while finishing a Master's Degree. My mother is convinced that it's just allergies, but I am absolutely terrified. How on earth did you guys deal with the anxiety and fear? I've just been lying in bed crying most of the day just or watching old TV shows trying to ignore how scared I am.

Persistent Headache	Hello! Has anyone experience JUST a persistent headache before testing positive? The only thing that i’m experiencing is a headache that comes and goes and wanna know if anyone else had just this symptom. Some days I feel fine, but it’ll randomly come and i all i wanna do is lay down. No other symptoms, thankfully, but just need advice. I have a doctors appointment scheduled for Thursday and i’ve has the headache for maybe 1.5 week/2 weeks now. I feel better than when it first started though, so hopefully that’s a good sign.

Antibody Test Returned Negative	I have had difficulty breathing since late February along with chills, nausea, and chest pain. I had a chest x-ray, EKG, etc. and both my lungs and heart were ruled out as sources of the issue. I finally convinced my doctor to give me a Covid test (they decided on administering the antibody test due to the length of my symptoms) and it came back negative. I'm wondering if anyone else is in this situation. I'm still having symptoms of breathing difficulty, coughing, and chest tightness that is exacerbated when attempting to exercise. If I a completely sedentary the symptoms almost are fully resolved. The main difficulty is I was an avid runner prior to this and can't do so anymore without symptoms returning.

You might have an oximeter and not know it	If you own a Samsung Galaxy S6 or better, the S Health app includes an Oximeter which is surprisingly good. I had my 3rd wave of symptoms yesterday (day 21), and it was able to pick up that my SpO2 went to 87% just from going to the bathroom, then returning to high nineties. The option is hidden under 'stress' in the S Health app. When you measure the stress, you get SpO2 and pulse at once.

Test came back negative, but still have lower throat dryness and fatigue	As the title suggests, my test came back negative today. Has anyone else experienced a lingering “dryness” or “itchiness” in their lower throat along with periodic fatigue and joint soreness? I haven’t had many symptoms besides that.

First post here: Day 4 of being positive	27m, went to get tested after my fiancée (27f) tested positive. My results came back on her 2nd day of being positive. We’re both trying to figure out how to quarantine while living together as we’ve both shown wildly different symptoms. She was initially vomiting and had steady diarrhea several days prior to getting tested with a low grade fever peaking at 99.6. Since then, all of those symptoms have died down and been replaced with coughing, mild congestion, and COMPLETE lack of taste. She says everything tastes like cardboard, even when she tried adding hot sauce. I on the other hand have kept at 98.6 or lower consistently and only have mild and inconsistent chest pains, along with some congestion, coughing, and occasional sneezing. Due to different symptoms and timelines, should we be quarantining separately? We have been so far but haven’t been able to get any concrete answers as to wether or not it’s going to really accomplish anything.

My boyfriend and I both tested positive. I’m glad we decided to get tested because I had no idea that these neurological issues were actually symptoms until the day we got tested. Dizziness, confusion, memory loss, feelings of depression. I am dizzy most of the day, but the most difficult part is the confusion. It hits me like a brick, and the best way I can try to explain it is like...my brain knows what sentence I want to speak, but it chops the words up into 20 pieces and scrambles them. My brain just shuts down trying to unscramble my thoughts and words, and by the time I figure out the first couple of words, it’s scrambled again. I can’t even speak. Our doctors say that having these symptoms (especially ONLY these symptoms) is super atypical and it scares me to death because nobody knows if this is going to be a long-term effect or even a permanent problem.

But upon seeing my feet the doctor said, ""Oh, that's what COVID toes look like!"" and brought in 4 others to see them as they had only heard rumors. However, I still have one lingering purple spot and ""blister"" on one toe (down from originally 9 toes to varying degrees). Even it is shrunk and dried looking but not gone.

31F What to Expect Based on My Symptoms So Far?	Hi everyone, I am waiting on test results, although I'm presumed positive based on my symptoms. On Thursday, I was dizzy and fatigued beyond what is normal, but after having a nap I felt fine. On Friday, I lost some of my sense of taste and smell, I would say about 50% of what I can normally taste/smell. It is now Monday, 4 days later, and I don't have new symptoms, just still with diminished taste/smell. No fever, no cough, no aches, no extraordinary fatigue... I know the virus is different for everyone, but I'm curious about what I can expect moving forward, does anyone have a similar trajectory of symptoms?	31F What to Expect Based on My Symptoms So Far?

Covid before?	I just wanna know something. On July 20, I had symptoms similar to covid, such as very wet cough, runny nose (watery mucus), congestion, diarrhea, and the morning of the third day, my sense of smell and taste was like at 50% and in the end of the night was completely gone but the next day it was 100% back. I took a test the same day my sense came back but it came back 4 days later as negative. I just want to know what was wrong with me whether I had covid or something else. My mom kept saying it was just allergies or bronchitis. I completely recovered perfectly fine, no sob, no fatigue, no nothing and I recovered after 13-14 days.	Covid before?

COVID and running.	I caught the virus about a month ago. I had two weeks of flu like symptoms. Lucky I didn’t have it that bad and got over it. A few weeks before my cardio was at its best in a while, 5 mile runs 2xs a week about around 9 minute miles. And doing good overall, now 2 weeks after the sickness I’m having trouble running 2 miles. Just finished a 17 minute 2 mile! I’ve done way better then this. Does anyone else have experience like this? I know the virus attacks your lungs, but it’s very discouraging knowing I took 10 steps back, how long will my lungs be like this. Please don’t reply with “at least you recovered”, just want to see if anymore has the same experiences as me.	COVID and running. I caught the virus about a month ago.

70 days in oximeter levels still fall below 95	Anybody have this happen to them? I got the virus back in late March and one of the things i noticed is when I would have lung flare ups my oximeter readings would drop by a few points. On my best days sitting idly my oximeter readings would be 97, now I'm going through yet another flare up in my lungs (will it ever end?), and my oximeter readings are dipping down into 94-93 range, this is of course accompanied by chest tightness and a little lung rattling, any body else can relate? I'm really getting tired of this shit.	70 days in oximeter levels still fall below 95 Anybody have this happen to them?

People reporting fatigue, have something to tell...	Soo, a few weeks ago I did an antibody Test as I have Antiphospholipid Antibodies and they checked if it’s cause was a virus or some sort of that. I was I’ll mid January, early February and end March. All the time it was a running nose, sore throat and fever. But, I’ve never received a call from my hematologist to confirm my antibodies, which I presume if would have been positive, would have been done... But right now I’m dealing with base fatigue. I’m just waking up, eating and then sitting down on the couch, not having any motivation to stand up at all. I’m totally healthy, besides asthma which I’ve had as a child (But it may be disappeared throughout the years), now out of no where I’ve had thrombosis, later on caused by antibodies (APS(Hughes Syndrome))... But what if the (covid)-antibodies are gone, but I had it, which actually caused this autoimmune condition? Nor the doc can answer this question so I guess I’ll just have to accept it. Mainly wanted to report my fatigue aswell. Was worse though, at some point hadn’t had any motivation to even eat or do anything, felt like severe depression idk,	People reporting fatigue, have something to tell...

Covid-Positive But Have Exams This Week	I'm 20/f and a student who recently tested positive for COVID. Symptoms started 9/14 with a sore throat and congestion, following two days I developed severe headaches and a cough, then 9/17 fatigue kicked in and I got tested then confirmed 9/19. The fatigue and headaches are endless, some hours of the day I feel fine but others I feel like I can't keep my eyes open. I have two exams this week and two next week and I just don't know what to do to combat the fatigue and brain fog. It's extremely stressful since online learning is not the easiest and these symptoms are not helping my situation. I would ask for an extension on my exams, but it is not certain that I will get it and will also put an extra stressor on me because I will end up behind on the material regardless so I would much rather just try to stay on top of things. This semester is really important to me and I would appreciate any advice about how to push through these symptoms. Thank you!

Mom is diabetic and coronavirus positive	My mom is T2 diabetic and has been having symptoms since Thursday 4/2/2020. She went and got tested Friday and we got the results on Wednesday that she was positive for the virus. Her symptoms have been fairly mild with just a slight cough and a low grade fever but with all the news out there I’m freaking out. Is there anyone that has had the virus and has recovered and if so please share your experience with me and if she should be doing anything help out. Thank you.

How long did it take?	Curious as to how long it took you to get your test results? Specifically, is there anyone out there that tested positive and it took a week or more to receive the news? My symptoms started last Tuesday the 14th and I was able to get a test on Friday the 17th. The website says 6-10 days but my thinking was that those that test positive will hear sooner rather than later as those are a priority. This is assuming of course that the delay with the labs is reporting and not the actual testing itself.	How long did it take? Curious as to how long it took you to get your test results?

Can early symptoms leave for days only to return?	I’ve read a lot of your stories and I see that in the duration of showing symptoms, many symptoms can come and go by the hour. Is this true for days as well? About 5 days ago I woke up with a tickle in my throat, extreme exhaustion, headaches all day, and my body was sore. I figured it could’ve been due to a hangover. I wasn’t that hungover though, and typically even if I am fairly hungover, I feel better around noon. I was extremely tired all day. I even took a three hour nap (unheard of for me). That night I couldn’t sleep to save my life. I felt like I was hot, then cold, hot, then cold. I didn’t have a fever, but I did have diarrhea. Body aches worsened. No noticeable shortness of breath. Then over the last few days, I’ve felt relatively normal. I went ahead and got tested yesterday just to be safe. There is still something up with my throat.

Stressful week.	My parents got diagnosed with covid. They were tested. They most likely got i from my sisters who was treated for strep recently, but most likely it was covid. They were babysitting my daughter when they suddenly started feeling sick. Now my wife is sick and will be tested this weekend. My two daughters seem ok. And I am not feeling sick. Maybe I will get sick later or I might just be an asymptomatic carries. I think most likely my wife will test positive. We also have a month old daughter. It is all a lot to think about it.

I felt better New Year's EVe, and would say I was back to normal on the 2nd. Around the 4th or 5th of January, I suddenly developed a dry cough out of nowhere. Slight fever. The next day, it was a full blown thing, heavy chest, phlegm-y cough, body ache, fever, incredibly tired. Symptoms went away slowly and the last to go were the on and off fevers even after the cough subsided. I remember hearing from a doctor friend that they had seen quite a few cases like mine at that period of time in my country, all sick for a few days, got better and got even sicker after then recovered again.

Dog Question	I am in the U.K. so have not been tested. I had mild symptoms and I’m better now. The strongest symptom was loss of taste and smell. The week I was ‘ill’, my dog was so not interested in me. She kept away from me completely. Now normally I am her favourite person. She is SO excited when I come home or enter the room. She follows me around the house. She thinks I’m great! (She’s the only one) So the behaviour while I was ill was very odd. I’m just wondering if any other dog owners noticed anything similar.

Reminder: Masks Actually WORK	I tested positive for covid after getting tested on Sept. 13th. (I went and got tested since my roommate got tested and it came back negative but that she had traces of it). I am a college student and one of my classes is ceramics. My college cancelled in person classes for 2 weeks to lower positive cases. During this time, my ceramics class required us to go in an art room and create projects ourself. The days leading up to my test and the day I got tested, I had been going in and out of this room. I was even talking and socializing with the other students there while I was, unaware at the fact I had covid during this time. And yes, I had my mask on during these times, was cleaning up my work area before and after with a provided bleach/water cleaner, and was using hand sanitizer religiously. I spoke with the classmates I had interacted with then just yesterday and told them how I had covid. They were shocked since none of them had gotten it. Moral of the story: wear your mask, they WORK.

Day 5 and no symptoms?	I tested positive Monday after starting to feel sick on Sunday. I’ve got a killer headache that comes and goes, a mild sore throat that does the same, and overall fatigue. No cough or breathing problems, but everything I read says that this is just about the time I would start to experience those things. Honestly I’m scared that I’m going to wake up one day and it’s going to be worse. So far I’m surprised at how it just feels like any other flu/bad cold I’ve ever had. I’ve literally gone to work in worse condition than this. So I know I’m not totally out of the woods, but are these good signs? I’m 35, male, no serious health problems. Usually pretty active but haven’t had the energy for the last week or so, obviously.	Day 5 and no symptoms? I tested positive Monday after starting to feel sick on Sunday.

I’ve literally gone to work in worse condition than this. So I know I’m not totally out of the woods, but are these good signs? I’m 35, male, no serious health problems. Usually pretty active but haven’t had the energy for the last week or so, obviously.	2
Symptoms are reshowing after a week.	My wife, daughter(4y/o presumed positive) and I all tested positive on 8/11. I’m most certain I had it a week or so before 8/11 and gave it to my wife, as I had lost my sense of smell and taste the week prior to testing. My wife and I had no fever, slight shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea, slight cough, chills and loss of senses. My daughter had a cough for 3 day and was fine after. My wife was still having daily zoom appointments with PCP while I was already cleared(8/16). A few appointments before she was cleared (8/20) I started to get a stuffy nose and some minor nasal congestion, PCP said it was most likely allergies because I had no other symptoms at that time. It’s now 8/24 and im having mild fevers, chills, shortness of breath, I’ve had a constant head ache since 8/21, and I’m feeling lethargic. My wife is starting to have a similar problem with the stuffy nose and congestion (Daughter is showing no symptoms atm). We are contacting PCP later today but, I was wondering if anyone else has been cleared by their doctor and started to reshow symptoms afterwards? I’m just	Symptoms are reshowing after a week.

My question is to those have already started school or are about to as I was tested positive and have been going through the disease but start school in a couple of days. How did you prepare and how are you getting through it?	I just tested positive and have had severe body aches the last couple days. My head aches have developed into a brain fog/confusion and it’s hard to stand up. For the most part my breathing has gotten better and less coughing over all.

For those that have recovered...What is your experience with hot food? Do you keep smelling a specific scent everywhere?	Namely coffee, and chicken, rice, even pasta....Does it all have this sort of odd taste? All of those taste the same to me, some mildly, but coffee especially. I was super sick in April, got tested for the antibodies in like late May/early June. Came back positive, so I assumed when I was sick it may have been the virus. I still wear my mask. I never really had the taste/smell symptoms but now it's been too much to ignore. I love coffee, and I assumed it was just a bad batch or my coffee machine being ass but now I keep tasting the same bad taste in a lot of things, and I mostly notice it in hot foods. Like just not I had crispy chicken with garlic sauce and white rice and...It wasn't the strong garlic taste, till got it, but I also kept getting hits of the bad taste. I'm trying to see if it's covid related, but I just keep seeing articles about symptoms and not stuff about after (presumably) getting it and didn't see anything about hot food specifically.

How to prepare?	Healthy person here, no symptoms at all and have been isolating for 7 days. Do you have any tips you could share to help people like me prepare in case we get the virus? Are there any particular items or meds that are helping you get through it? Saw one guy here say that eating weed edibles helped a lot!

Tested positive, and will be clear to work around others soon but work wants me to test negative first before coming back?	Hi everyone, So I'm here because I'm starting to panic. I knew that if I got infected I'd get put off work for a while and I dreaded it but it happened and now I'm self isolating and its been almost 3 weeks. I live alone and I got sick Monday June 29th with a fever and started quarantining myself that day. I got tested on the 7th and just yesterday I got my results. I tested positive and was instructed to self isolate for 10 days since the day I got tested and an additional 3 days to watch for symptoms. I feel perfectly fine now and I'm just sitting at home watching tv and studying for my GRE exam. I reported to my work and they told me that I needed to test negative before I could come back. And I understand, there's a pandemic going on, I work with a lot of people which is probably how I got sick in the first place. But the health department told me that I would test positive for a while even if I was no longer infectious. Testing also took forever, so now I'm worried that I'm going to	Tested positive, and will be clear to work around others soon but work wants me to test negative first before coming back?

Has anyone been able to get tested without having a fever?	22M I’ve been bounced around clinics that do test, but have been unwilling to test me. This morning I had a slight fever (99.5), dry cough, tight chest, and body/headaches. One place refused to test me unless I had been in contact with someone who tested positive, despite the fact that their sister facility told me to get tested for covid in their ER parking lot. Finally, I was able to see a doctor who was testing. My fever was gone by then, but all my other symptoms remained. My blood pressure was 160/90 which the nurses and doc were very concerned about. They tested me for the flu and it came back negative. The doc said it could be “some respiratory illness”, but wouldn’t test me unless my fever spiked again.

Day (10 or 11) - things that helped me	26M no underlying conditions - I’ve had symptoms for about 10 or 11 days now. Gone through chest pains, congestion, loss of smell/taste, shortness of breath, fatigue, slight cough, dizziness, and intense brain fog. Some of the things that I found really helpful were: - Teas (oregano and onion) sounds really gross but I couldn’t really taste it lol but it definitely helped me - inhaling steam from boiling eucalyptus leaves sometimes drops of eucalyptus to help with the breathing - I took ibuprofen (still taking it) - reading things about others progression (it’s easy to let anxiety take over. Just remember most of us will be fine and it’ll pass) - doing things to calm me down (for me it was praying) - resting, but it’s good to get up and get a bit of sun if you can even if only for a little - DayQuil for some of the other symptoms - stay hydrated and eat if even just a little -buy an oximeter (helps calm me down to know my oxygen levels were ok) Just wanted to let everyone know it sucks sometimes but you’ll pull through!

Just tested positive	Had a test done on the weekend. No symptoms at all. Got a call this morning with a positive test result. By the afternoon today I had a low grade fever, a little tired but what I’m feeling the most is this terrible pain in my legs. Cramping almost? I did a leg workout a few days ago, but this seems much more than my typical soreness. Anyone else experience this? I’m worried. Secondly, my wife just went out and got the test done. We are assuming she has it and our two little ones. We have been at home isolating since March and I’ve only gone out to get groceries a handful of times using all precautions available (mask, gloves, lysol wipes, etc). I’m worried about what to do in terms of my little kids. I’m worried I’ve given them this virus and so worried about the next couple of weeks... should I simply isolate from my family at this time? Do we continue on (I put them to sleep, change diapers, etc...)? Doctor told me to continue on as usual, and more importantly stay home for the 14 days minimum. Any advice would be great. Thanks!

Should I get retested a third time if I had a mild case? (Positive then negative)	Timeline: 4/14 tested positive loss sense of smell and taste. No other symptoms like cough or fever, or anything. Maybe minor nasal congestion? 4/24: smell and taste came back. No congestion. Felt recovered 5/10: tested NEGATIVE (my second test) still no new symptoms fever free no medications asking since lots of people on this sub are testing positive, negative, then positive. my symptoms were fairly mild, and it might be a little hard to get a third test. I am not returning back to work for almost another 3 weeks a month. should I just trust this negative? frankly due to many people testing positive I was expecting myself to be positive still due to dead virus fragments. I am getting back to normal life booking my dentist appointments and stuff but wondered if it’s worth to try and get a third test at this point. I’m just scared to infect anyone else.

Can you get covid l-19 from: Shortness of breathing, chest pain, heart palpitations and tingling on arms, hands, and feet.	27M- I’ve recently been in the ER back on July 4th due to heart palpitations, heart fluttering chest discomfort, fatigue, muscle aches, and difficult breathing and of course. The blood tests, ECG, chest X-rays all came clean and perfect. Couldn’t find what was wrong. I went to urgent care again but this time I got two medicine- one steroid and the other for night sleeping due to asthma attacks. The other doc told me that she could hear my wheezing and it’s possibly allergies/pneumonia or even suspected coronavirus. So I went and got the COVID-19 swab tested on 7th. Itching to hear back, figured I would have some comfort of words down here since these time I’ve experienced chest discomfort, shortness of breathing due to asthma/panic attack but always go away if I really rest and focus on my breathing. Wondering if this has happened to anyone with no symptoms of fever or cough to get coronavirus? (Healthy, doesn’t smoke or drink, nor do any illegal drugs. Have mild asthma back when I was little).

If you look at my post history, you will see the frantic searching and investigating I've done to figure out what this thing was. I tested negative twice for the virus. My symptoms were most likely considered mild but then moved to moderate because I was a fool and decided to do vigorous exercising. My primary care didn't think it was the virus. I finally went to a cardiologist today to get my heart checked out. It looked like the virus was affecting my heart during the ER visits. The cardiologist didn't find anything wrong today which is a good thing. He thinks it was quite possibly Covid-19. The tests are pretty inaccurate. And the antibody are inaccurate too. He talked about me going to get tested for the antibodies, but he thinks it's just a waste of time because of the inaccuracies. He says Covid-19 is more of a clinical diagnosis because of all the inaccuracies and problems with the testing. Now that I've pinpointed that Covid-19 was likely the cause of my symptoms.

Is this generally true? Do those with only mild symptoms have a much better chance of NOT having any longer term health issues?	0

Hey curious if these symptoms match	Hey guys, so yesterday at around midnight I had a slightly sore throat but thought it was yelling during cod(yes i know). Anyways a slight sinus headache came with that last night which I took ibuprofen for and managed to go to sleep. This morning I wake up woozy with a 100 flat mini fever and it has only progressed to a 102.6 and my feet and hands are cold/numb. Thanks for any responses and please wear a mask!

Anyone else can’t sleep?	Anyone else have trouble sleeping? I know it’s the anxiety of having covid but it really sucks. Right before I’m going to fall asleep I jerk awake in fear.

Testing swabbed throat, not nose?	I am being tested for covid and a bunch of other viruses through my doctor. I was told the test is a PCR test.

Tested Negative - All the classic symptoms	On day 9 now Started out fever &gt; 102, body aches, dry cough; Day 5 - Oxygen Saturation 91, fever &gt; 100, cough turning wet, less aches; Day 9 Still coughing like mad, fever &gt; 99, Oxygen up to 95%, starting to feel better. Two other people I know, husband and wife, on day 24. Similar symptoms, hers is more prolonged. All three came back negative. We all also got results with the wrong test numbers, then they called back and said oops, but still negative. Self administered cheek/roof of mouth test at LA testing site. Either the rumors of 30% false negative rate are true, or there is another really bad upper respiratory flu-like bug going around. Be careful folks, two of these bugs at the same time would be devastating. Crap test being pushed to make folks feel like their representatives are doing something probably worse.

Would those who are in their 20s and otherwise healthy mind sharing their experience with covid?	Hey everyone! I’m 99% sure my first symptoms began to onset two days ago (which is weird since I’ve only been going to the grocery store and on walks for two weeks now but alas). I’m 24, normal BMI, non smoker and no other health conditions and currently experiencing a low grade fever but no other symptoms except from tiredness (but not EXTREME fatigue). I’m nervous there may be a rapid downturn in my future so would love to hear how others in similar health standing have experienced this virus. Thank you so much and hope you all stay as safe as possible!	Would those who are in their 20s and otherwise healthy mind sharing their experience with covid? Hey everyone!

One of my students is covid positive	And weirdly enough I don't have to isolate for 14 days. All of my students do, but not me. They say I'm not at risk because I'm a teacher and wasn't really having any close contact with them. The only thing was I was less than 2 meters away from them even though we were each wearing a mask. Now I'm scared I might have it and am unsure about what to do. There is probably a slim chance I got it and am worried to pass it over to people, and this situation just makes me really stressed. Anyone else in the same situation?

Do we need to quarantine from each other?	Out of my 4 roommates 2 of us have tested positive and moved out. My other roommate and I tested negative today.

I’ve had subtle symptoms for 8 days now	It all started last Sunday (6/28) I woke up feeling nauseous and vomited. Throughout the day I experienced chills, hot flashes, and fatigue on top of the nausea. Fast forward a couple days, the nausea is gone but the chills and hot flashes remained. Since then all the way up until today the chills have disappeared but I still get minor hot flashes and fatigue (also yesterday I developed a low grade fever) and just a general weird feeling I can’t describe that only happens at random times during the day. I also need to add that for the majority of each day, I would feel completely normal but at random times throughout each day I would experience these symptoms listed above. Most of my symptoms have been improving though. Now, I got tested last Tuesday and it was negative, but my doctor told me to self isolate until I follow up with her and discuss a possible retest. Still feeling minor symptoms now so I got a retest today, waiting on the results for that. I know it’s impossible to tell over the internet but does this sound like COVID?

26m - Tested positive 3 weeks ago (mild symptons)	Posting here just so there's more information of the different ways the virus can affect you. The first sympton I had was a headache that lasted for two days only. On the second day of the headache I noticed I couldn't smell anything, and at this moment it was highly suspected I had the virus. By the third day my headaches were completely gone and so I went to get tested and it unsurprisingly came back positive. The days that followed the only symptons I had - along with loss of smell and taste - was congestion in my nostrils, which made it kind of difficult to breathe through my nose, although I could blow my nose and it would unclog it, but I could breathe through my mouth no problem. And I also had what I can only describe as hyperawareness of my body, where I could feel my internal organs more so than usual, not unpleasantly. Around the 10th day I was completely back to normal. Smell and taste have returned and no other symptons were present. I did take medication as soon as the third day after I lost my smell. I took Azitromicina, Ivermectina, Aspirin Junior	26m - Tested positive 3 weeks ago (mild symptons) Posting here just so there's more information of the different ways the virus can affect you.

Guilty feeling after testing positive	I am returning to university this fall. I was supposed to move in this weekend coming up but had to be tested before returning. I took the saliva test at home and sent it in only to get the result of POSITIVE. I am unsure of how this happened due to the fact that I have only been in close contact with my family and boyfriend, nobody else, in the last 2 weeks. I even wear a mask while going for walks outside if I feel like I can not social distance in the more commercial areas. I have no symptoms and was completely blindsided by the results. I feel guilty due to the fact that I had just seen my aunt and cousins for a small outdoor gathering just so that I could say goodbye. This was after the period where my contacts were limited to only my family and boyfriend and I had no symptoms as well. Nobody else has symptoms ( at least not yet). I had also just gotten tested 3 weeks ago ( nasal swab) and it returned a negative result. I am not sure what to do. I informed my aunt and cousins.

Overwhelming Guilt	Saturday night my throat hurt a tiny bit and I had a stuffy nose. Being someone with pretty bad allergies, I’m kinda used to this feeling and I assumed it was simply from a change in weather pressure or an increase in pollen count. The weather has been all over lately, so this made complete sense. I had lunch with my girlfriend Saturday, and I hung out with my friend all day yesterday. I’ve been around my brother a good bit and he has Crohn’s disease and he’s on Remicade so he has a weakened immune system. This morning I woke up with extreme sinus pressure, a very stuffy nose, and on top of that, the inability to smell or taste well. At first I assumed I couldn’t smell because of my stuffy nose. When I got really close to my soap or chapstick, I could somewhat smell. I chewed some gum and It didn’t taste the same. It was very dull. I got a rapid test about an hour ago and it came back positive. I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt.

When does breathing return to normal?	"I caught the ""flu"" when COVID was just being reported in the US, when they were only testing those who had recently traveled to China. I was on a work trip in NYC before catching it. I had the symptoms that make me and my friend (infectious diseases PA) think I may have had COVID - temperature up to 104, shivering, body aches, and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath was such that I ended up going to urgent care to see if it was pneumonia. After not seeing anything on the x-ray they told me to keep taking tamiflu. This was in early March. I am back to normal with everything EXCEPT for the breathing. I have asthma but am generally healthy and fit. But ever since getting sick, I get winded just walking a few blocks. Which is ridiculous because my favorite exercise is hiking and here I am unable to walk through flat sidewalks without having to stop to rest. For those who have had COVID and have recovered, has your breathing returned to normal? If so, how long did it take?"	"When does breathing return to normal?

So i think I'm positive...	I made a post earlier about how I was helping my mother who was tested positive. She's getting better but I think I may have caught the virus somehow. I'm 18 and just this morning, after 5 days of helping my Mother, I had a runny nose. Now during the night time, I feel sick inside. Like how someone with a cold would feel. I checked my temperature and it's around 98.6. I know I should call a doctor instead of asking reddit, but I just want to know, for my peace of mind, how others around my age felt if they had the virus.	So i think I'm positive...

Cold Symptoms, runny nose, sore throat, sneezing	My mom began feeling cold like symptoms on 9/30. She was sniffling, blowing her nose, a sore throat. Two days later, towards the evening, my (19F) throat begins to hurt. Every time I ever get a cold, it always starts with a sore throat. Next day, throat is really sore, coughing with mucus. The next day, 10/5, the sore throat is gone and my nose is stuffed up, runny, and I have sinus pressure. My mom is similar. My dad started feeling a sore throat yesterday and is again getting nose congestion. My mom got tested today, so we are awaiting her results. But I really wonder if this is covid or a cold? We haven’t had fevers, shortness of breath, or anything (knock on wood). It’s just weird to me how we all have pretty much had the same symptoms and they all just feel like our normal colds (I always get a cold during the fall season). Any thoughts?

Been months and I’m struggling with anger	I got wildly, and weirdly sick after going to first week of school this semester. NY - late January - extremely high volumes of international and NYC students. I was sick as a dog, couldn’t breathe + hold any food or liquid, weird cognitive problems. Basically had never felt like this. Tested negative for flu a and b in the hospital. Ever since, I’ve just felt different. As if things aren’t tolerable or manageable at certain times. Idk. I just can’t shake the feeling everything changed after I got ill. I had actually thought my body already entered sepsis at one point at home during stomach pain/head pain before going to the hospital.

Did anyone test positive here with severe asthma ?	What was your experience and how badly did it affect your breathing/lungs.

What did your Covid cough feel like at the beginning?	I woke up today and yesterday with a tickle in my throat; today is definitely worse. I’ve only felt the need to cough probably twice, but I definitely have that odd tickle feeling and like I need to clear my throat a little. I did fly a few weeks ago (I had to - my father is terminally ill and they were thinking he was going to pass away) but it’s been almost 2wks since my flight home. I am in Colorado though where the fires are bad and I went for a 45 min brisk walk last night where I was breathing with my mouth open a lot. Usually when I get a cough (which happens, I get bronchitis generally about once a year) my throat hurts to swallow before I start coughing, and like I said, this is a tickle. So just wondering if anyone can tell me what their cough felt like as it was coming on.	What did your Covid cough feel like at the beginning?

Mask purchasing advice	I have been getting by at a high contact workplace without wearing a mask and looks like the day is fast approaching where I will be mandated by the state and my workplace to wear one. I am one of those wonderful people who actually becomes ill from wearing a mask- surgical or fabric. I never had issues wearing a surgical mask or sports buff before but ever since I came down with the virus, my lungs are shot and I get asthma attacks from them. A kind friend gave me a cloth fabric mask and I nearly fainted while wearing it out on a walk with her. Anyone here get similar reactions and what kind of mask did you find that helped you to breathe better without adverse reactions. I am willing to look like I'm living in a fallout movie or look like Darth Vader, just don't want to do resort to my workplace advice of going to HR and them handing me the accommodation of remote work. What is a good reliable place to get a mask on-line or what type should I look for? Thank you kindly.

Positive cases leaving the house?	Hi! It’s almost been a week since I tested positive, and I’m fortunate enough to have a mild case of it. I’m taking care of myself as best I can, and my doctor is hopeful that I’ll be able to fight it off and be back to work soon. I live with my father and brother. My father is also positive. He felt a little sick last week but we wouldn’t have even known about it if I hadn’t been tested routinely at work. My brother is negative. My question is, our local health department recommends total quarantine, but my dad insists that I’d be able to leave the house, go drive to pick up food somewhere, and take walks around the block. I’ve told him a number of times that our DOH told us to totally quarantine ourselves, though we’ve been doing things in and outside of the house (like cleaning). Leaving the house for anything else is completely irresponsible, right? Like I feel like I’ve tried to tell him that I don’t feel comfortable going anywhere for now because I’m still feeling under the weather, but he insists that I can just leave since we’re not REALLY coming	Positive cases leaving the house?

Was it a true false positive?	I know that the chances of this are super super low. I’m going to give all the details and I’m looking for other explanations for how this happened to my friend and to me. My friend / potential romantic interest works for a company where they are required to get tested before beginning a new project. In order to get work he must always stay safe and test negative. He began a project about a month ago with a team of 25-30 confirmed negative people and made direct contact with maybe seven. They were so safe that he joked about almost tasting cleaning products in the food from the cook who also had to be negative. Upon leaving the project everyone did both an antibody test and a covid test. Instead of doing one in that city, he drove back home to his family and stayed at one hotel on the way for a night. He says he wore a mask, was solitary, washed his hands, and only exchanged his credit card with the lady at the desk which was guarded by a glass screen. He was sort of sketched out because the hotel had some graffiti on the walls	Was it a true false positive? I know that the chances of this are super super low.

Post Covid Telogen Effluvium. Who else is experiencing this?	I am two and a half months post Covid and my hair is falling out like crazy. It’s making me really worried and borderline depressed, because everything I read says there’s no way to stop it or solution it; I just have to let it run it’s course. This has never happened to me and now it’s coming out in small clumps, I find hair everywhere, and my scalp is SOOO oily. Anyone else experiencing this?	Post Covid Telogen Effluvium.

COVID-19 with fever, but primarily gastrointestinal symptoms in an elderly woman? I've been around her and have weirdly low SpO2 readings, but no real symptoms.	My grandmother is in her late 80's and refuses to go to the hospital. Since I've been around her, and even accidentally drank after her, I decided to quarantine with her alone, away from the rest of my family, at her house until I can figure this out. I'm not in a COVID hotspot exactly...my county of 660,000 people has only have just north of 1,000 confirmed cases and 60 deaths....but still. I exercise regularly and have had no symptoms. But, my pulse ox (I use it to track my pulse when doing cardio) started giving me erroneous readings (but only at rest), high 80's to low 90's (pic): [https://postimg.cc/RqTS3cvm](https://postimg.cc/RqTS3cvm) Then about 10 days or so after I started noticing that, my grandmother, who I'm around frequently, woke up with a fever and lower abdominal pain one day. Long story short, she adamantly refuses the ER and I have decided to give in and take a calculated risk by keeping her out of a hospital where she really 'could' catch COVID, and to just stay with her and monitor her like a hawk. Her SpO2 has been normal. Just the fever, some lower abdominal pain, diahreah, and 'dry heaving'... luckly	COVID-19 with fever, but primarily gastrointestinal symptoms in an elderly woman?

What were your earliest symptoms like?	I started off with a bit of an itch in my throat two days ago that I was almost certain was going to go away; but then I woke up yesterday with quite an intense sore throat. Further into the night I began feeling the SLIGHTEST bit of tenderness in my muscles all over, and today the tenderness got a bit more intense to where I can obviously feel it but it isn’t unbearable pain or anything. Throat pain I’d say more or less the same as yesterday. No runny nose but the back of my nose burns when I swallow just above my throat (no clue if I described that accurately lmao). And lastly, I’ve not had a fever whatsoever at any point, nor have I had any shortness of breath. I don’t know for sure how soon I can get tested. My work place was meant to help me out ASAP, but there’s some unexpected trouble that popped up. I’m self isolating until further notice but I can’t help but have this on my mind.

Meds/Supplements that help with symptoms	Hi everyone! I just wanted to share some aids that helped me to manage my symptoms. I thought maybe each of us has something to share as well. So, the first supplement that helped me with severe nausea was activated charcoal. I felt severely nauseous when I had a fever, I couldn't eat. I read that it's because I was intoxicated with the virus and charcoal supplement can help with intoxication. It really helped me!!! Usually charcoal is used when you eat something bad, have nausea and need to clean your gut. Another supplement that helped me was Valocordin. I bought it in Russian online pharmacy. It's a tincture that supports heart. It's natural, it's a blend of Adonis herb, Lily of the valley leaf, hawthorn berry, valerian root, peppermint oil. It helped me with rapid heart rate and anxiety. I also took some vitamins (D, C) and zinc. And was drinking tea with Manuka honey. Not sure if it helped me or not. I'm not a doctor but I just wanted to share this with everybody. Do you take any medications/supplements that helped you with the symptoms? Please share! Stay safe and healthy 🙏❤️	Meds/Supplements that help with symptoms Hi everyone!

Anyone get a negative test the first time around?	I’m on about day 6 of real symptoms. Day one yielded a very red and swollen throat, headache, diarrhea, congestion, very minor difficulty breathing. Had congestion and headache for 2 days prior. Returned to urgent care yesterday with a lot of trouble breathing, swollen throat gone but headache, sniffles, increased sleep, and chest tightness greatly increased. Today I am seeing a drop in pulse ox levels down as low as 87 (usually 90-92) if I am moving around, but quickly rebound to 94-97 if laying. Nurse friends are suggesting I may want to get another Covid test. An x ray ruled out pneumonia already- TLDR; Has anyone tested positive about a week after testing negative with symptoms? Thanks in advance for any comments.	Anyone get a negative test the first time around? I’m on about day 6 of real symptoms.

Mother in COVID study- tests positive- now my whole family has it.	My mother is a healthcare worker and researcher at a large metropolitan hospital. She drops off a Covid test every week as a part of a back to work study. Last week she dropped off a sample (Tuesday June 30). Her test came back with one of the two markers needed to be a confirmed positive. The research is running the study we’re anxiously waiting her test drop off this week as they believed that she would be positive. They were correct in that assumption but NEVER TOLD HER and she spread the virus to myself and 5 of our family members (ages 1.5-58). This is a post for another time, but I cannot believe that they did not tell her that she was probably positive for the virus as all of this could’ve been avoided. Anyway, my husband had to be hospitalized for a mental health crisis and as a preventative measure they tested him for COVID and he was positive (Monday). My daughter and I went ahead and got tested and so did my father Tuesday (all positive). We all caught our coronavirus so early that we all tested positive before symptoms started showing.

Just got my positive results today	Hi, Early 20s Male here in California. I started having a cough and itchy throat on Friday. I didn't think much of it since it's been super smoky here and I left my windows open for a couple of nights, until my roommate mentioned feeling the same. Got tested yesterday morning and it came back positive. So far my symptoms have been light, cough on friday, fever that got up to 101 on saturday and general weakness and aches. my fever was gone today (i only took tylenol once) and only was around 99.1. My real question is, i have a phlegmy cough. starting Saturday. usually every few hours once i cough up the phlegm, my breathing gets easier. i'm a bit wheezy til i get the phlegm out. is this a normal symtpom? I have an oximeter and my oxygen levels have been at 95 or above the whole time. just looking for some guidance, thanks.	Just got my positive results today Hi, Early 20s Male here in California.

False Negative Swab Test	"My boyfriend and I were tested a couple days ago and got results back, and it said we were COVID negative. My boyfriend and I were shocked. My boyfriend has all the classic symptoms and I have everything except the fever too. Talked to some medical people and they said the swab test is only accurate for a short window and not everyone has COVID in their nose for the swab. Blood or saliva is more accurate, but it is not available in my state to ordinary citizens. My doctor could only find hospitals that did it and they didnt offer appointments to the public. My boss now believes I am COVID negative and is making me return to work. I'm terrified. My best friend works with me and she is pregnant. I dont want to get her or anyone else sick but my test says I'm ""fine"" to return to work. What the hell do I do?"

My boyfriend has all the classic symptoms and I have everything except the fever too. Talked to some medical people and they said the swab test is only accurate for a short window and not everyone has COVID in their nose for the swab. Blood or saliva is more accurate, but it is not available in my state to ordinary citizens. My doctor could only find hospitals that did it and they didnt offer appointments to the public. My boss now believes I am COVID negative and is making me return to work. I'm terrified. My best friend works with me and she is pregnant. I dont want to get her or anyone else sick but my test says I'm ""fine"" to return to work. What the hell do I do?"	1
8 weeks plus since first symptom	So glad I found this site. I was so worried cos everything in the media suggests recovery in 14 days. Yet, 8 weeks after first symptom, I still have occasional symptoms every few days. First symptom Friday March 13 (no kidding!). Positive test on 3/20. My symptoms are very mild, thankfully. Fever (&lt;99.5 F, but feel worse) and chills that 'go to your head'. Nothing else, but when the chill waves come, cannot do anything but lay in bed and under the covers. Since then, I've had 3 consecutive negative tests but the symptoms still appear every few days. But they are much less intense. Overall, however, the 'good times' are very clearly increasingly outnumbering the 'bad times'; and there are longer periods of good days between the bad days. It is mentally difficult to be positive when the symptoms come back just when you think you have fully recovered. I just wanted to say thanks to this group and 'stay positive'.	8 weeks plus since first symptom So glad I found this site. I was so worried cos everything in the media suggests recovery in 14 days.

My only COVID symptom was very smelly poop, anyone else?	I'm not trolling!! I'm covid positive, 20 years old, Male. I thought it was funny that the only thing that covid has done to me is make my sh*t smell SOOOO bad (probably due to malabsorption of nutrients, a possible symptom of covid) No cough, no fever, clear lungs, but I got stinky poop. I know this is a serious subreddit, but there's humor in everything so I thought I'd share something funny. Cheers, hope y'all are doing okay Lol	My only COVID symptom was very smelly poop, anyone else? I'm not trolling!! I'm covid positive, 20 years old, Male.

COVID and pets	Does anybody have any experiences with the virus and pets? I have 2 cats and I would hate for them to catch my virus. It would be difficult for me to lock them up all day and nobody would want to take care of them since they could be contagious. I looked it up online but it seems there’s no definite answer wether or not they can get it from humans. Any advice on keeping your pets safe while recovering from the virus?

How do I measure the duration of my symptoms?	My first symptoms (I thought) appeared last Monday on March 16th but were very mild until the weekend (March 20th) when my week long sore throat turned into green phlegm in the mornings and a bit of a cough at night, with headaches, fatigue, ringing ears, 2 days diarrhea, and one day of nauseau. Now (March 25th) I'm having a bit of pain in my left chest area especially when breathing very deeply. If I hold my breath for around 10 seconds I don't feel pain or discomfort which is weird. Also today I woke up with significantly less phlegm, almost none. What I'm worried about is that im onto the 3rd wave of the virus and I'll be either hospitalized in the next few days, or left with lasting lung damage at 24. I had initially thought that since my first symptoms appeared on the 16th, I'd essentially be in the clear by the 30th. Now I'm worried that the first week didn't count? Very confused and concerned..

Catching corona at the hospital?	My dad tested negative but got pneumonia since a few weeks ago and just recently admitted to the hospital. We were scared to go before because we heard of others catching it at the hospital on top of their disease and didn’t make it. I’m just scared if something like that happens to my dad. He’s taking antibiotics for pneumonia so getting corona on top of that is just not great at all.	Catching corona at the hospital?

Do you still have antibodies, months after illness?	I got very sick in March, with covid-like symptoms. (I was heavily sick for 2 months... and then dealing with after effects until even today) Didn't get tests (couldn't) at the time. I did antibody tests yesterday (31 august 2020). They came back negative. Question for those who were confirmed positive a few months back: Have you done antibody tests a long time after your illness? (how long) What was the result? &amp;#x200B; Thanks	Do you still have antibodies, months after illness? I got very sick in March, with covid-like symptoms.

Support or experiences. 11 month old positive	Looking for support or experiences. I tested positive on Sunday. Had allergy like symptoms, 2 episodes (1 day apart) of diarrhea with horrible cramps, and just very tired. Then lost my sense of smell Saturday night. My husband and 10 year old son were both tested (Sunday and Monday respectively) and were both negative. But Monday morning my 11 month old started running fever, up to 103. Some diarrhea that day. And she also had congestion, runny nose a few weeks before, but none now. She tested positive. She is breastfed and we are continuing to nurse. Her fever has evened out today. Only requiring medications 3 times. Temp only got up to 100. She’s nursing more frequently, drinking some water, and eating ok. She’s just very tired, sensitive, cranky, not herself. Has anyone had a little one test positive? Please share with me your experience. Thank you	Support or experiences. 11 month old positive Looking for support or experiences.

Extremely vulnerable patient, mild case of covid!	Hi all, just wanted to share a surprising experience that my father in law went through. He is classed as extremely vulnerable, with all of the diseases associated with covid mortality. He is 70 years old, overweight, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, hepatitis along with some rare chronic disease called Mediterranean fever. He started experiencing symptoms around 1 week ago, diarrhoea, fever of 38 degrees and a slight cough. However he felt well, just off his food. Fast forward to today, he hasn’t had any more symptoms, he feels well, no cough, shortness of breath or fever! It’s awful to say but when he tested positive we automatically thought the worst given his poor health. I must say this is a very strange disease that seems to be affecting people very differently!

Hypochondriac or reason to worry?	Hi all. Not sure if I’m just being a hypochondriac or I actually have reason to worry. I tested negative for covid almost three weeks ago now after having a throbbing headache that lasted for about 2 weeks, on top of some nausea and chest pain, alternating between a severe heartburn like feeling to a stabbing pain. After my negative test result however, I started developing a sore throat and a sort of rattling feeling in my chest, felt somewhaty like there was something crackling in my lungs. I also developed an elevated temp for about two weeks, the highest was 99.8, usually it ranged from 99.1-99.5 most days. Nothing in the high fever range, but my usual baseline temp is around 97.5. I also had a headache during the higher fever days, which got worse when I coughed, which would happen sporadically. On Sunday, I woke up out of a deep sleep and my heart was racing, I checked it with my hr monitor and it was 135, but I could feel my heart like it was trying to jump out of my chest. I wondered if it may have been anxiety so I tried to do some deep	Hypochondriac or reason to worry? Hi all. Not sure if I’m just being a hypochondriac or I actually have reason to worry.

What symptoms did you have (17)	I am a 17 and think I have Covid. It started Tuesday with a sore throat. I (stupidly) went to school because I had a big test I couldn’t miss and if I went online the teachers would suspect I did it to cheat. Tuesday was also my last day at my job so didn’t want to call in sick since they would think I am just trying to leave early. Wednesday I stayed home. By Friday I had a sore throat, congestion, fever, and a cough. Today I have all of the above with no taste and I feel super weak. I have a test Sunday. (Scheduled it Thursday gotta love the wait) I have never had a sickness I can’t shake in one or two days of rest. Does this sound like it could be covid? I am worried since I went to school and work.

Rapid test gave no results, then negative?	"Hi everyone - I received a rapid covid test at an urgent care on Tuesday night. They said they'd call within an hour for results, but I ended up having to call them 3 times for my results. The first two times they said the results had not been recorded (this was about 20 hours after being tested), then the last call about 24 hours after I was tested, they said ""something happened"" to several of the tests given on Tuesday and they gave no results of any kind, so I should call back the next day to talk to a manager. I called when they opened the next day, and they said that now my test was reading negative. I followed up to ask for some kind of explanation, but I've heard nothing. I'm just looking for some peace of mind before I go back to work tomorrow. Has this happened to anyone else?"	"Rapid test gave no results, then negative?

Worried sick	My fiancé is in hospital with the virus. He’s only just taken himself in three days ago. His lungs are in a bad way and he has clots.

I had a feeling it was going to happen	My family doesn't do social distancing very well. They keep inviting people over to our house. Earlier today, a relative had invited friends and family over to their house to swim at their pool. I've been doing my best to social distance but it's hard when the rest of your family that you live with doesn't. So I stayed away from people as best as I could. Almost everyone swam in the pool and ate snacks from the same bag; digging their hands in there and not washing them. I had a small feeling in my gut that something was going to happen. But I thought that was just me worrying too much about this virus. This evening we got a call that one of the families that came was exposed to a person who had just tested positive for the virus. I knew this was going to happen, and I've been saying it to my family that we shouldn't keep inviting people over. But like always, my family never listens to me. They always think I'm overreacting. I wish they would just listen for once. Now we wait.	I had a feeling it was going to happen My family doesn't do social distancing very well. They keep inviting people over to our house.

Anyone experienced leg pain?	My mum may have the virus. Since yesterday she has leg pain (calvf pain exactly) as if she had walked too much. When she walks the pain completely stops. Pain is worse when seated than standing. It's on the back of the calf. She says the pain is 2 or 3 out of 10. If she has the virus it's day 33. She's very high risk (COPD, HPB), 55 and smokes (gives me hope the smoking thing is true but who knows). She got sore throat on the mornings of days 1-3 and 8. She coughs but she coughed before as well so can't tell. No tests in my country. I definitely have the virus and have been isolated when symptoms appeared but maybe too late and nothing's perfect. My question is only about the leg pain: did it happen to any of you/people you know/things you've read online? Was it only calves or all the body? Thank you :)	Anyone experienced leg pain?

please please help	i know i’m not supposed to post here since i’m not a confirmed positive- but it’s currently 4:26am and my anxiety is keeping me awake. i’ll delete this soon sorry. i’ve had a very mild scratchy throat for a few days, then today my throat has been tender? it doesn’t hurt to swallow or anything but it’s sensitive to touch. i have no other symptoms at all (besides minor headaches which i’ve had my whole life). is it possible to have covid without a fever or a cough? my whole family and i have been very careful throughout this time but i can think of a few instances where it’s possible i contracted it. i’m not too worried about myself but i live with my dad who is 60. i’m worried to tell my family because they have extremely bad covid-related anxiety and i don’t want to work them up about getting tested if i don’t need to? please help in any way you can. i’m very worried.	please please help i know i’m not supposed to post here since i’m not a confirmed positive- but it’s currently 4:26am and my anxiety is keeping me awake. i’ll delete this soon sorry. i’ve had a very mild scratchy throat for a few days, then today my throat has been tender? it doesn’t hurt to swallow or anything but it’s sensitive to touch. i have no other symptoms at all (besides minor headaches which i’ve had my whole life). is it possible to have covid without a fever or a cough? my whole family and i have been very careful throughout this time but i can think of a few instances where it’s possible i contracted it. i’m not too worried about myself but i live with my dad who is 60. i’m worried to tell my family because they have extremely bad covid-related anxiety and i don’t want to work them up about getting tested if i don’t need to? please help in any way you can. i’m very worried.	0
Covid?	I have phlegm in the back of my throat and my throat is sore. Do I need to take the test or no? I work at an airport that's why I'm concerned.	Covid?

I (21M) tested positive for COVID yesterday and the anxiety of it is killing me	Hello all, Starting nearly two weeks ago I began to develop a very mild sore throat. Ignored it thinking it was just my allergies, I often have sore throats due to my allergies so it was not a point of concern for me, but as the sore throat persisted I began to worry and eventually went to get tested for COVID on Thursday of last week. The test was a rapid test and my results came back negative in less than an hour. I figured it was still just allergies at that point. Come Sunday morning, my sore throat is worse and not only that but I developed a fever and body chills and aches overnight. Because I already tested negative before I figured I might have had strep and took myself to my doctors, there they offer to test me for COVID again and the next day, on Monday, I received my results which were positive. Since receiving my results, I have not had a fever or body aches, I've only popped a few painkillers on Monday and none on Tuesday. I am still a little fatigued but I believe it is mainly due to my lack of sleep	I (21M) tested positive for COVID yesterday and the anxiety of it is killing me Hello all, Starting nearly two weeks ago I began to develop a very mild sore throat.

Efficacy of disinfectant wipes?	"This week 4 people from my job tested positive, and I've been left paranoid about if the disinfectant wipes I use on my phone/laptop are effective. Mainly the thing I'm hung up on is dwell time. Most packages say something along the lines of ""Use enough product for surface to remain wet for 4 minutes to disinfect"", but some say only 15 seconds to 'sanitize'. I've only been able to find one source confirming that ~30 seconds should be enough to kill 99% of an enveloped virus like COVID. Is anyone able to shed light on this? I'm hoping I can be put at ease because I simply do not have enough product to get things wet for 4 minutes several times a week. Hopefully this isn't too out of place here, but r/coronavirus doesn't allow text posts and I'm not sure where else to get answers."	"Efficacy of disinfectant wipes?

Frequent sewage smell?	Hello again! Has anyone on here who has had covid had an off/ sewage smell? I keep smelling it wherever I go. I smell it on people, my pets, bathrooms, with some foods and drinks etc. It’s the same smell and I smell it all of the time. It’s really gross. Has anyone else experienced this? My partner is experiencing it too! So we are thinking it’s covid related. He lost his sense of smell and can now only smell one thing (which is the sort of off/sewage smell). I never lost my sense of smell fully but now have this one smell that is recurring. Just curious, thanks!	Frequent sewage smell? Hello again!

Not sure what to do	I started having a stuffy/runny nose on 10/7 at night. When I woke up on 10/8 I was very congested, sneezing a lot, itchy/scratchy throat, no fever. I took my temperature throughout the day and it was fluctuating between 97.5 and 99.8. I had chills yesterday. Today on 10/9 I am still very congested and started coughing a little bit, and I am dead tired, literally falling asleep sitting at my desk. I have still been going to work because I technically don't have a fever. I took a covid test 2 weeks ago and it was negative. Should I get another test? wait? leave work? I just feel like crap overall.	Not sure what to do I started having a stuffy/runny nose on 10/7 at night. When I woke up on 10/8 I was very congested, sneezing a lot, itchy/scratchy throat, no fever.

Tested Positive Yesterday (My Exp. So Far)	I started feeling symptoms about 3 days ago. I got a rapid test yesterday. It came back positive today. Day one was easy. I had a bit of a dry nose yet runny nose but that was it. The second day the nose got a bit worse. It kind of felt like air was passing into my brain but honestly wasn't that bad. I had a very minor headache. I didn't even bother taking any Advil. The third day (today) nothing has gotten any worse. I took a tylanol and honestly didn't even feel like I was sick whatsoever. However, lost some of my sense of smell today. I have no cough, no fever, no phlem, no sore throat, and no aches. I feel energized and normal. I'm a pretty healthy 18yo and male. Is this what others are feeling or am I just asymptomatic? Anyone know if it is going to get any worse?	Tested Positive Yesterday (My Exp. So Far) I started feeling symptoms about 3 days ago.

Just tested positive and have health anxiety, please help me calm down	Starting June 26th I had pretty bad indigestion and it hasn’t gone away yet, I threw up on that one day and that was it. July 6th I got a super dry throat. I’ve been feeling a little weak and tired but that’s about it. I get a headache sometimes at night but once I lay down I feel fine. I’ve been getting weird feelings in my arms and chest but I normally get those so I didn’t think much of it. I found out my mother tested positive for COVID so my dad and I got tested too. He turned out negative twice so I thought I’d be negative too, but alas I turned out positive. I’m so fucking scared. How long have I been sick? Will I ever get over it? I’m only 17 I don’t want to die yet. Is the indigestion I’m experiencing part of it?

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills	It's been 34 days since symptom onset. I tested positive 6/22 and negative on 7/21 but this weekend I have had worsening symptoms again and am back in bed around the clock. The chills, aches, hot flashes, fatigue, green phlegm, feverish feeling, dizziness, airhead balloon feeling, the fizzing vibrating feeling, sore throat, all of it's back. Should I go to the hospital? I ordered another at-home test but it will take at least a week and a half to get those results where I am, and I'm supposed to be at work at 9am tomorrow morning and nobody in my office knows how to do my job because I'm the only person in my department working currently as they assumed I would be fine and have antibodies after testing negative. So if I go to the hospital, I will likely get fired... am I overreacting? :(	I feel like I'm taking crazy pills It's been 34 days since symptom onset.

Chest X-Ray After COVID?	I (23F) tested positive for COVID on June 22. I had pretty mild symptoms throughout it but since the two week mark, my shortness of breath has continued to get worse. I’ve always dealt with shortness of breath due to anxiety and take medication for it, but this feels different. It feels as if I’m breathing through cotton and it comes and goes every few days. I can feel a clear distinction between my normal anxiety induced breathing and how this feels. I’m not sure if it’s COVID related but it started with the virus so that’s what I’m assuming. Has anyone else experienced this? My dad suggested I should get a chest x-ray or something just to see where my lung function is at. Has anyone gotten a chest x-ray or done any other tests to assess your lungs after COVID? Any responses are appreciated. Thank you!	Chest X-Ray After COVID?

Post inflammation issues	(37 m, no pre conditions, virginia, o+) I was presumed covid positive at the end of March. I started having symptoms around March 18th and really struggled until the end of April. I developed a mild pneumonia and was first given azithromycin and on the last day of taking that I was given hydroxychloroquine. I am not sure if either helped as I was prescribed these approximately 2 and 3 weeks into this hell hole. As of today I am about 65ish days in. I still have the lingering effects of this bitch people refer to as covid. I developed covid hands. Think of covid toes but on your hands. Basically they feel like they have frost bite. They are red at the tips, splotchy, burn, itch, swollen, and occassionally will wake you up in the middle of the night throbbing. This seems to be subsiding a little after over two weeks. Also I have a skin rash on my face. This is red splotchy, itches, and is flakey. It is almost like sever dandruff. I have a short beard and occassionally I will get a minor form of this when healthy.

Reliability of Oximeters and Recovery	Hello, Background: 31M, no known health issues, presumed positive by multiple doctors (can’t get tested unless hospitalized.) First symptoms presented 3/13 still experiencing them now. (A few false starts for recovery.) Symptoms: chest pain, SoB, fever (gone away now) digestive issues (intermittent) dizziness and elevated heart rate. Purpose: I have an Oximeter which I have been checking my levels diligently. Recently, I’ve been experiencing panic attack like symptoms (heart rate spikes, dizziness, chest pain.) I’ve also noticed that my oximeter seems to be giving me conflicting information. Specifically, my problem is this: The typical reading for my oximeter when awake is anywhere from 97-98. When I try to sleep, I find myself either waking up suddenly or just about to doze off and feeling terrible. (Like a wave coming on.) I check my levels and my SpO2 is down to 91, 89 even as low as 84. However, the levels rapidly climb back up and within like 10-15 seconds are back up to at least 96-97.

Still Positive After Recovery	Hey covid queens and kings, So I tested positive about two weeks ago and followed CDC guidelines by isolating myself to my room for 10 days. On the 11th day I had recovered from my symptoms, besides my lack of sense of smell, and no fever for 72 hours so I ended my isolation as well as retested so I could return to work. However I just found out I’m still positive even though I’m almost fully recovered. I’ve read you can still carry the virus and not be contagious, but my work will not let me back until I receive a negative test result. Sooo, I guess I’m just curious, for those who had covid and retested, how long did it take for the negative appear? Also am I still contagious right now, should I be isolating? I’m so confused. My mom just tested positive too and I’m not sure if I should be isolating from her as well. Could I get it again? It’s a mystery.	Still Positive After Recovery Hey covid queens and kings, So I tested positive about two weeks ago and followed CDC guidelines by isolating myself to my room for 10 days. On the 11th day I had recovered from my symptoms, besides my lack of sense of smell, and no fever for 72 hours so I ended my isolation as well as retested so I could return to work. However I just found out I’m still positive even though I’m almost fully recovered. I’ve read you can still carry the virus and not be contagious, but my work will not let me back until I receive a negative test result. Sooo, I guess I’m just curious, for those who had covid and retested, how long did it take for the negative appear? Also am I still contagious right now, should I be isolating? I’m so confused.

Go with your gut	22F Tested positive today after my only symptoms being a slight headache and a little bit of a runny nose. The runny nose I associated with moving to Florida and things blooming here that I wasn’t used to. And headaches are not uncommon for me to get. Despite being pretty much asymptomatic, I ended up deciding to get tested. I had a gut feeling and I guess that gut feeling was right. If you even have the slightest gut feeling that you might have it, please go get tested. It’s better to know than wonder and possibly spread it! Stay safe, friends.

Do you think my family has had it?	December 2019 my mothers friend came back from a holiday in Turkey to England. A few days later started showing the symptoms of a cold/chest infection that then progressed to peumonia by the middle of December. She was put on anti-biotics and everyone thought thatd be it cos no one knew about COVID then. Christmas day she comes to visit my parents house where myself, my parter and our then 4 month old daughter were also visiting. My daughter got lots of cuddles and kisses as you do with babies and my mothers friend was told she wasn't contagious anymore etc. 1 day after new years my daughter is lethargic, high temp, pulling in at her chest cos shes breathing heavy and generally a very unwell baby but she was in good spirits. We took her to the hospital anyway because you dont take chances with your kids. They listened to her chest and heard congestion and had an 02 saturation in the high 80's - low 90's so was taken in. At first she was under observation in a private room which lead up to a nose mask to a whole face mast giving her oxygen and a feeding	Do you think my family has had it?

Grandpa (78) on day 10 of vent. Need medical information.	"(Cross posted) Hi all. I just need some information from anyone who understands. Bear with me, this will be a long story...this happened in NJ. My grandpa went to the hospital about 2 weeks ago with mild COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) after acquiring it in Queens, NY. They hooked him up to oxygen and gave him the anti-malaria drug. Within 4 days he was doing very well. They transitioned him to a normal floor and his fever broke. We talked to him and the doctors were very optimistic for his being discharged within 24 hours. Overnight his condition worsened. They transferred him to the ICU. They tell us it is because he required more oxygen and that's all (2 liters to 4 liters to 6 liters and then automatic ICU transfer). He's lucid still, speaking to us, mild fever. Doctors say do not panic. Day 2 in the ICU he's doing ok. Then, overnight they have him sign a waiver to be intubated without telling the family. The doctors called us after it was already done the next morning (my mom broke down crying). They told us at the time it was ""preventative"" because of suspected pneumonia,"	Grandpa (78) on day 10 of vent. Need medical information. (Cross posted) Hi all.

Anyone else feel this way?	ETA: I didn’t know what flair to add, but every time I try and post in covid support subs, it says I can’t post there - which is odd, because I comment there daily. Fun fact about me? I haven’t touched anything outside of my home in seven months now. Since February. No door handles, no clothes, food, boxes in stores - nothing. And I hate feeling this way, as if...if I touch something, I’ll get it. I was diagnosed with OCD about nine years ago. So I am sure that some of you who are familiar with OCD can understand what is going through my mind right now. But ever since I first started hearing about Covid in the news, I made it a point to tell myself: “I won’t touch ANYTHING” anymore while in public. When I go to the store, my husband does the shopping. He pushes the cart (that’s been wiped down with two Clorox wipes that I bring from home) and I’ll point to the items we are needing for our home (food and essentials). We both wear masks - sometimes doubled - and both carry hand sanitizer with us. Most of the doors that	Anyone else feel this way?

A month since symptoms began. Suddenly have SOB.	I was presumed positive (did not get tested) a few weeks ago after being in close contact with two people confirmed positive. A month ago my symptoms started as mild nausea and diarrhea (neither abnormal for me) followed by bronchitis and a dry cough I still have. Originally diagnosed with bronchitis by doctor who then said I was presumed positive after finding out I was in contact with presumed positives. My symptoms never changed. Basically just chronic dry cough, very mild chest pain that comes and goes and mild chest tightness which has mostly dissipated. I have been feeling mostly better. Never had a fever. Never felt sick . Never was lethargic, dizzy, muscle aches, fatigue etc. nothing. All symptoms pretty mild. Wouldn’t even suspect a thing if I wasn’t aware of COVID. Always the chance I did not pick up COVID, so that’s been in the back of my mind too. Today I woke up with a noticeable SOB. My lungs feel ok. I can breathe in all the way and exhale fine but it just feels like I’m a bit winded. Like I have to think about it. I do suffer from anxiety but don’t feel particularly anxious	A month since symptoms began. Suddenly have SOB.

Sharing Supplement Info for COVID-19 Treatment	When I tested positive my doctor told me that another doctor had been doing a lot of research on certain supplements and their affect on COVID. She gave me a sheet of his findings and how much to take. I’m just sharing this to y’all. I am not a doctor, this was given to me by one: For PREVENTION: (Vitamin C - 500mg twice daily) (Quercetin 250-500mg twice daily) (Zinc 75-100mg daily) (Melatonin) (Vitamin D3 1000 IU-4000 IU daily) (Take all except melatonin with food) For Symptomatic Treatment: (Vitamin C - 1000mg twice daily) (Quercetin - 250mg-500mg twice daily) (Zinc - 75-100mg daily) (Melatonin) (Vitamin D3 - 2000 IU to 4000 IU daily) (Green Tea Extract - up to 800mg daily) I take these and I kicked all symptoms other than congestion, loss of taste and smell in 5 days after first symptoms showed up.

I don't know what to think	"I got sick back in January here in the US. At that point, it ""wasn't in the US,"" but I'm not convinced that's true. I was sick for a couple of weeks with a fever, chills, dry cough, lethargy, sore glands, sinus burning, and postnasal drip. There may have been other symptoms, but I don't remember. I was sick enough to miss work for several days, but I went back, exhausted and still coughing like crazy. It went away for a weekend, then came back with a vengeance for two weeks. Rinse and repeat. After the third visit to urgent care and three nebulizer treatments, they gave me a steroid inhaler and a regular inhaler. Things got better after that. By this point, it was mid-March. I was easily winded until probably the middle of April, but I was functioning. Then it came back. Low grade fever, chills, sweats, tightness in my chest, and dry cough. Lasted a few days, then disappeared. Came back a month later. Same. And here it is again, a month later.

Husband and I both tested positive, do we continue self isolation from one another?	I began symptoms June 30, and am now feeling much better. I got tested July 4th at Mayo Clinic and received results same day. Husband and I began set isolating immediately. He got tested on Tuesday and just got his results yesterday, also positive. He has been symptom free for the most part, except a headache that started on Friday. No fever in either of us. We are able to keep self isolating, but I was wondering if we should wait until we are both considered in the clear to return to normal cohabitation or if it even matters anymore. After two weeks, I miss my husband, it sounds stupid considering he’s in the room down the hall, but I do. :( Thanks guys. Wishing all of you a speedy recovery.

Breathlessness as only symptom?	Hello, I've been having troubles breathing for the past 4 days. I first noticed it when I went on a bike ride. I've gotten tested today and am awaiting result. My question is, did anyone else have only this symptom (+ maybe fatigue?). How was the progression for you, how long did it get worse for you? It's been getting steadily worse for the past 4 days and I can't walk much before being out of breath, I can't got to the ER since I have no insurance here, just looking to see what your symptom progression was and how long it took for your lungs to recover.

Wife and I tested positive, what to do with our teenagers?	My wife and I have both tested positive for COVID and also have two teenagers. What should we do with them, or how have others managed who are positive and have family? Not be in the same confined space? Sanitize after leaving the room? Masks all the time?

How do I find a lab with FDA approved Antibody Tests?	I got the rapid test, came back negative, but now I've heard a study last week showed as much as a 48% false negative rate!

Did not believe I would be positive	40 y/o mother of 2. I got tested because my kids were sick - took one for the team. Found out 5 days after I tested that I’m positive. Tested 4 days after my child first exhibited symptoms. They have had constant 99.7 temp. One has cough and runny nose. The other no really symptoms. Makes me feel validated that my sore throat (which has been worse with allergies) and need to nap ( I love naps anyway) are actually symptoms of coronavirus. I also get geographic tongue normally and it is hurting right now. No loss of smell or taste though. More tired than usual - have hypothyroidism but take levothryoxin for that. Highest temp was 101.7 day before I tested. Seemed like a fluke - was in a hot room for too long. Type A+ blood. Husband has no symptoms - did not test - he is Type 0 + and believes he is too healthy to have it :/. Hope it doesn’t get any worse. Seems we are far enough along to not get worse symptoms?

Has anyone else had lasting chest pain after mostly recovering? If so, how would you describe it?	My COVID-19 symptoms were: lethargy; very high fever (terrible dreams the first night); bad sore throat; congestion; and a very bad cough -- made my chest hurt -- which eventually, I think, turned into walking pneumonia, because I had some shortness of breath towards the end. Also, for weeks after, I had a weird kind of chest pain -- mostly in the place where I felt the worst pain while coughing. I'm not sure what it was, but it seems like it could be described as *costochondritis*? Basically, for some weeks after recovering from the illness, if I sat down on a bench or slouched, when I got up, I would have a weird chest pain. If I brushed my teeth or washed my hands forcefully, I'd have this chest pain. And then, just a few weeks ago, it basically stopped. Has anyone else had this kind of lingering chest pain?

Antibody test result	I was fairly sick during the middle of March (13th) while at university with cold symptoms, pulsating headaches, shivers, diarrhea, and insane fatigue. All my other symptoms went away fairly quickly save for the fatigue (took 6 weeks to subside) and the headaches which I have to this day, though they’ve been less intense ever since I started taking Vitamin D. I never got the COVID test but I ended up taking the Abbott IGG SARS-CoV-2 Test from LabCorps 12 weeks after my initial systems and got my results by the following day: Positive. I wanted to ask how accurate these tests are. Is it common to get a false positive? Granted, my parents will also take the antibody test as they got sick a couple days after I returned home from college (March 15th). If you guys have any tips with regard to lessening the headaches, it would be much appreciated. Thanks! Edit: I’m 22 years old and fairly healthy.

Were any of you experiencing low O2 after the six week mark, later in the day?	I got sick in late March, starting with a loss of smell. I was diagnosed by a telemedicine in early April. 7 weeks on, my only serious symptom is low O2 early in the afternoon, and then occasionally at night. I’ve had a raft of medical tests. There’s literally nothing that would indicate that there’s anything wrong, except some chest pain and my O2 dropping to the mid eighties after several hours. I’m 50. I was in good shape two months ago. I’m moderately overweight. I’m female. There’s nothing remarkable about me physically, except ankylosing spondylitis and celiac. Anyone else experience the same thing? How long did it take to recover?	Were any of you experiencing low O2 after the six week mark, later in the day?

Not sure if this could be covid	For the past two weeks now i’ve had a crushing headache or migraine that won’t go away, what seems to be high blood pressure, dizziness and lightheadedness, sore muscles and fatigued when i stand up or walk around, and just overall have felt horrible. I’ve left work more times the past couple weeks than ever before due to migraines. It seems my eyes are just extra sensitive to light and there is constant pressure near my eyes. Could this be Covid-19? I went to my doctor just a couple days ago, she didn’t mention covid at all, just put me on a daily migraine medicine. I’m suspicious about the symptoms though, i’ve never had a headache for this long. I am taking more pain pills and migraine medicines than ever before. Please let me know if anybody has had similar experiences	Not sure if this could be covid For the past two weeks now i’ve had a crushing headache or migraine that won’t go away, what seems to be high blood pressure, dizziness and lightheadedness, sore muscles and fatigued when i stand up or walk around, and just overall have felt horrible.

My time with COVID-19	On June 27, I was tested for Covid after feeling sick. My joints were achey, low to no fever, eyes burned, was very lethargic and tired (slept 18 hours straight), had diarrhea, and over all felt shitty. I have been quarantined since 6/26. My symptoms lasted for about 5-6 days, where I felt normal on 7/1/2020. I’ve tested on: 6/27: positive 7/11: positive 7/17: negative 7/20: positive 7/28: waiting for results I’m bored at home. I have taken the time to organize my life - you know, going through old paper work and getting rid of crap and clutter in the house - and have found interest in creating video content for YouTube. Throughout all of this, my girlfriend who lives with me tests negative for each time I test. She must have had Covid earlier in the year. She has antibodies. I really miss going into work. I miss my family. I miss a lot of the night life here in Vegas. When Vegas “opened” back up in Phase 2, this reopening made me feel a little better, knowing that life was going to take a lot of adjusting here and everywhere else.

20 M, two months after infection. Discussion of symptoms and after effects.	Hello, I tested positive along with my family the beginning of March. The sickness was very bad, I had a headache, aching eyes, and a fever all at once. I never knew that combination was possible until then. My fever was 102+ for about 4 days. My family and I had to tough it out sadly. I experienced all symptoms except for covid toe. I ever had blood in my mucus during the peak and endless mucus. I didn’t have a very bad cough, just for about half a day, but my nose was always stuffy. One night 2 weeks after infection I woke up around 2-3 AM with an intense fever, headache, and my eyes were burning. My body was very cold, I was shaking, and something I’ve never felt before which was my hands were buzzing badly. I had to get help from my mom and I was very uncoordinated and confused. My mom also told me my skin and face were super red. The effects I still have now are no sense of smell at all, my nose is stuffy more (wondering if I got nasal polyps from the virus), I’m short of breath more and one	20 M, two months after infection.

Feedback would be great	I’m currently 18 years old and when I was working today the middle of my chest hurt when I breathed in for like 5 minutes. I’ve also had bowel issues today (diarrhea), a bloated stomach, and a cough (i’ve had a cough from smoking anyways). Also have been fatigued but that could just be from lack of quality sleep. Is this criteria worthy of getting a test?	Feedback would be great I’m currently 18 years old and when I was working today the middle of my chest hurt when I breathed in for like 5 minutes.

Not positive, but worried about possible exposure	Hello all, Went on a outdoor lunch date yesterday early afternoon with a date She didn't disclose that she went to an actual house party on Friday night until we were actually eating, which annoyed me So I'm just wondering, how long would it take to be infectious after a possible exposure? From what I read, she's probably not possibly contagious after only a day and a half, but it still worries me.

Recovery health scare (funny)	"This happened day 10 or 12 after coming down ill. I had turned the corner and was feeling better each day. When I am ill, especially with a respiratory illness, I make a special hot tea. A Pirate- Grandma tea. Hot tea, lemon, honey, pinch of cinnamon, pinch of cayenne, a bit of ginger root and a hunk of dried turmeric root, along with a big glug of dark rum. After finishing the small picture of tea, I chewed on and ate the bits of ginger and turmeric roots. I watch a TV for awhile then get ready for bed. Glad I am feeling better. As I spit from brushing my teeth I see to my shock, my spit is dark yellow like concentrated urine. I am thinking ""Oh shit, my liver or kidneys are failing, maybe my pancreas.... Fuck..."" I keep spitting and it is an unhealthy yellow, wow. Upon further inspection, I note a speck of vegetable material in the sink. A dark orange speck- the damn tumeric. Apparently if you chew tumeric it will stain your mouth a deep yellow like Easter egg dye. All is well and I am feeling better. Damn near normal.

Tested 3/25	I'm not sure of this is really the right place to be posting this. But here we are, and I'd like to share my story for some feedback/support. This is long winded, just trying to give as much detail as possible. Sorry in advance. First off, a little background. I am a medical assistant in an outpatient wing at the local hospital in town. Like most hospitals in the US , we were severely unprepared and there was little to no education or urgency to keep staff safe. We were not taking precautions with travelers from hotspots who were asymptomatic within the past 14 days of said travel. Numerous patients came in from travel with low grade fevers. We thought nothing of it, we knew no better at this point I'm time. I will mention this was the very beginning of March. Fast forward, to 3/23. Our clinic is bare bones and seeing 'essential appts', and extra staff is being floated to other parts of the hospital for ancillary support. At this time, I get stationed to screen temperatures of patients coming into the hospital. There is a slowdown in the flow of people coming in.

To those who found out that they are positive (asymptomatic or not), are your actions afterwards depended on your government?	Hello. I come from a country where cases are still increasing and COVID testing are only voluntary if you wanna get tested or required at their work. I am really curious for those other countries especially what the government does to people which results came out positive. Did they let you decide to quarantine to a designated isolated area or to quarantine at your own place? Were they harsh to you?

The worst part of this pandemic is wondering if every cough, every headache is Covid.	It’s getting ridiculous. No less than 5 times since this all started I’ve seriously 100% thought I had it, only to not have it and be perfectly fine. It’s such a roller coaster. That and the fact that COVID-19 has literally EVERY symptom of a sickness known to man that means me waking up with a dry throat COULD be COVID-19. I’m so tired of it. I’m not a hypochondriac but this whole thing is certainly steering me in that direction.	The worst part of this pandemic is wondering if every cough, every headache is Covid. It’s getting ridiculous.

COVID19 and blood vessels / why it might be helpful to get a stress test EKG and Angiogram	"This post is for all my long haul homies dealing with SOB/no cough or sore throat but respiratory symptoms/fatigue/flair ups and medical system gaslighting as a result. Month 4 here. The main point of my post - you may want to get those cardiovascular tests in addition to pulmonary tests based on my experience. I've met many individuals like myself on here that began feeling symptoms the first week of March. My roommate was exposed to someone who later tested positive and had all the telltale signs (dry cough, fever, fatigue, etc.) But I only had a low-grade fever, scratchy throat, extreme fatigue, and headaches at first. I had no cough or sore throat. By the second week, this developed into intense shortness of breath and ""enflamed"" chest and back symptoms that have carried into four months. This was early on and the first test I was able to access was three and a half weeks in. It was the test where you cough into the petri dish. Because I wasn't coughing up mucus, the test administrator said that my test would probably come back negative. It did. I tested negative two weeks later, as well.

Is it possible I might have contracted Covid?	I lost my sense of smell and taste one night a few months ago, and got bad fatigue during the month of Ramadan. After a while I concluded it must have been Coronavirus. Now more recently, I've had bad cold symptoms, annoying eye aches, fatigue, fever, sore throat, and after waking up I'm starting to get tingly fingers. Could this be a normal cold? I can't really get tested as of now, I would like to hear your thoughts about what I'm experiencing.	Is it possible I might have contracted Covid?

3 months out and still experiencing symptoms	I (24m) had a mild case with low-grade fever, bronchitis, and cough. When those symptoms went away I started to get bad daily headaches which worried me and decided to go to the ER on August 31. They did a CT scan and told me I was fine. I still have the daily headaches (and hair loss) but something weird has happened to me two times and I'm wondering if it has happened to anyone else. While sitting down playing a video game, I had a sudden feeling of lightheadedness that came and went away in seconds. First time was around mid- August and lasted 30 seconds and today, lasted around 10 seconds. Has it happened to you?

Are you guys freaking out ?	I’m in Illinois in dupage county, I know someone I went to high school with got the virus and he lives about 15 minutes from me so I know it’s around here.

Throat Super Painful On One Side	I tested positive for COVID 2 days ago, and today is my 5th day with symptoms. Overall my case has been extremely mild, but the thing that seems to be the most annoying now is my sore throat. It's also weird because the sharp throat pain is only on the right side, and has been like that for over a day now. Any ideas why? I am hoping to god I don't have a strep/covid combo somehow.

I’m (17F) starting to show symptoms as well. I’ve been having a scratchy throat for 3 days but no cough, no fever, and no chills. The only thing that I can think is developing is chest pain. Been feeling tired but I feel like that’s regular for me. Could it be just my mind playing tricks on me because when I’m distracted I don’t really feel my throat. Should I bother getting a test? I’ve had contact with my mom but I wear masks and gloves but we could have had contact when she wasn’t showing symptoms.	My mom is tested Positive but My mom (35F) tested positive about a week ago.

Day 30 Since First Symptomatic	Hi there, I have been sick since about March 15th. I tested positive on March 24th. Like many people, this has been a roller-coaster for me. I am, at this point, no longer febrile and I have my taste and smell back (although not at full force). Every morning I wake up terrified that I'm going to back slide since my recovery has been so up and down. Lately, despite feeling pretty well, I have had terrible heartburn and what feels like something caught in my throat. It burns when I swallow and is very uncomfortable. I have been treating this with tums but it makes eating unappealing. I remain slightly fatigued and foggy -- my memory and ability to focus have suffered through this. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing heartburn or what feels like heartburn. I have an oximeter and my blood oxygen level seems fine. I still have a slight although productive cough but it's not crazy. No headache any more, thank god, and as I said, no fever. Thanks all, be well!

Salty and or Metallic taste? Unsure if COVID related?	For the last 3-4 days, I have been having a salty/metallic taste in my mouth. First it was more metallic, 2 days later shifted to be more salty. &amp;#x200B; I have no other noticeable symptoms. 25M, 160lbs, no preexisting conditions. In Tampa, Florida, and have gone out a little bit recently. &amp;#x200B; Anyone experience this? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but if COVID is a fair possibility I think I should get tested prior to some things I have coming up.	Salty and or Metallic taste? Unsure if COVID related?

Anyone experiencing a low body temperature since you’ve had Covid? I never really monitored my temp before all this but since I tested positive it has ranged from 95.2 to 99.7. I know for a fact 95.2 is supposed to be bad if not about dead.		Anyone experiencing a low body temperature since you’ve had Covid?

Family is recovering after 6 days	My family and I are all pretty much recovered. I know I don’t want to speak soon but it literally just felt like a mild cold for us. The only one that showed symptoms was me and I just coughing, headache, fatigue for a couple days. I wouldn’t have guessed it’s COVID I would’ve just thought it were a cold and only got tested because I was headed out of town for a friends wedding and she knew I was sick so I said I’d get tested for peace of mind. I have a BMI 20, non-smoker, exercise almost daily. My 4 and 6 year old coughed a few times and that was it. Husband just had fatigue. I don’t know if I actually believe we were positive but I’m thrilled that we’re over and done with it. It was not so bad 🤷🏻‍♀️ The isolation is the hardest part, six more days of boredom lol.

Tested positive 6 days ago, felt weird since 10-11 days ago	23M, not sure if it's too early to feel safe, because it's been 6 days since I was tested positive and no serious symptoms. I first had a strange feeling in my throat almost two weeks ago (and still have it), like I had to cough but at the same time didn't really. Just felt a little burden a little under my throat, somewhere in-between that and my chest. Sometimes my neck and my arms hurt, but it could be because I'm mostly in my bed watching TV. In the last two days I had a little inconvenience where I needed to take air and basically yawn every few minutes or so, while not being really tired. Just because I need that extra air, it's like I forgot to breath from time to time. I also have this very small sharp pain in the left side of my chest from time to time, but it's not really serious. I mostly wonder if anyone experienced such mild symptoms and suddenly it hit him like a train? I'm worried that my condition might worsen.

My Experience with COVID	I am a Doctor and there was already plenty of exposure for me and my colleagues and most of us ended up being positive. Heres my experience and the medicines I took. Day 1 First major symptom, Fever. I had a feeling of something in my throat for last 2-3 days but it didn't catch my attention. Day 2: Took panadol and went to Hospital in the morning feeling fine and then went to do Emergency at night. Midnight I noticed major cramping in my legs. Thought it was due to dehydration as I was fasting during the day and drank plenty of water and did ER till morning 8am and felt very tired during that. Day 3: Slept for almost entire day and woke up with fever around 100-101 and severe sorethroat, body aches and severe diarrhea. Day 4: Woke up with Severe eye irritation, redness,tearing and fever. Went to hospital and got tested, was very tired after coming back from hospital, slept again for 8-10hrs and again woke up with fever, sorethroat body aches and diarrhea Day 5. got report and found out I was positive. That day i felt much better symptomwise and thought i was recovering.

For those who had to deal with this can me and my girlfriend both sleep in the same bed if we both test positive?

Week 10-ish of recovery	Hello all! Sorry if this has all been talked about before, i was reading a good chunk of posts on here but i thought i should contribute my own experiences and also ask for some advice? was v sick in mid march-late march, felt like i was fully recovered by mid april. late april the GI issues started, the cramping started, the random inflammation started, and doctors keep telling me all my xrays, ultrasounds, and bloodwork is fine. went back last night because a portion of my face went numb for a minute before returning to normal. My heartrate at a resting rate has also been elevated p drastically and fluctuates throughout the day? normally i would be at an even 64-68 on a normal day, but recently its been low 70s or high 90s. I was worried about the possibility of a stroke or heart attack because of the strange numbness in my face and sometimes arms and legs, but the hospital says from my bloodwork they say they see no reason of me having any of the two :( &amp;#x200B; i cant speak to my pcp for another week, and im just concerned since it seems like some	Week 10-ish of recovery Hello all!

How physically inactive should I keep myself?	M22, 135 pounds, 5’6, Day 4 of symptoms, I think 7-8 days since exposure. No known pre-existing conditions. Would it be beneficial to go on walks/stretch? I’m reading accounts of people being more physically active when they start to feel better then relapsing. I’ve just started to have a cough and some chest pains, but no fever and blood oxygen is 98-99 consistently. Edit: on a side note, I’m taking the usual Vitamin C, D, Magnesium, and Zinc supplements. Any idea what a safe I.U. Of vitamin D is to take a day? I’m currently taking 1,600 I.U a day through vitamins and don’t want to overdo. I have another supplement that is 2,000 I.U I could add in.

Post-covid Paranoia	"Been almost two months now. It is mostly due to the horrible times i spent in hospital and my now-sensitiver lungs. Spending 11.5 days in that hellhole even if my status werent so bad. Being all alone in the white af room and the only furniture was my bed and a few stuff to lock my clothes in etc. I could barely see anyone's face. Only the stupidly inexperienced nurses' eyes through their astronautlike suits that come in like only 3 times a day giving me pills and injecting me blood thinner, sometimes doing tests and failing to find my vein while trying to extract my blood and ending up with 10 syringe stabs in my sore damn arms. Also no wifi and disgusting food. All i could do was listen to music for 11 days straight, couldnt even watch YT or anything to not consume my mobile data. I started to lose my damn sanity in that stupid room. Now i am scared out of my mind if i ever have to go back to that asylum and be sick again. Every time i feel sick-ish i go full ""oh fuck""."

How long does this law symptoms lasts	Okay fever checked on March 12. Fluke because I was just making sure the machine worked. I didn’t think I felt hot. So my normal temp is 96.7 or 97. It was getting up to 100 and stayed around 99 and here it is April 15th and now is dropping to 98. After first week I went into see my doc. I had no other symptoms. Not even allergy symptoms with pollen hitting us hard. Send me home. Finally 3 weeks of looking for a place to test I found a clinic that would take you if you have a fever. I had wanted to go in cause I though nah it must be something else. Nope you either test for covid-19 or go somewhere else. I was having a lot of joint and muscle pain in my hips and knees. I am flexible by nature and this was wayyyy out of the norm for me. Also my eyes were red and hot and irritated in the morning like I’d been on a 3 days bender. So drive through, Tuesday April 7th was earliest I could get. I got the call on Saturday April 11th that I am positive. 🦠They	How long does this law symptoms lasts Okay fever checked on March 12.

Extreme COVID Guilt???	Recently, my aunt visited my family and I on Sunday and we found out today that she was tested positive (asymptomatic). Keep in mind that I did come in close contact with her. I visited my boyfriend on Wednesday and only find out TODAY that my aunt was tested positive, which I feel extremely guilty knowing that I could have exposed my coworkers and my boyfriend and his family. I had to go home immediately so I don’t spread it to more people in the case that I could have contracted COVID. But right now, I feel nothing but guilt and shame on myself especially since I decided to go out. Obviously, I didn’t know that she was positive a few days ago, but I can’t help but think it’s my fault for going out and possibly spreading it to more people. I’m trying to schedule a test; I just hope it comes out negative. But to be real, has anyone that got tested positive or presumed they were positive after coming in contact with someone felt extreme guilt??	Extreme COVID Guilt???

Covid anxiety vs actual covid	Just wanted to share my experience; I suffered from massive anxiety regarding coronavirus, I would often wake up in the middle of the night unable to breathe, continuously sure that I was infected and my lungs were failing... As restrictions began to ease (I’m in the UK) I started to feel less anxious and began to go about life in a normal(ish) way. One week after my daughter (7) started back at school she started to get a bit of a sniffly, she had no other symptoms and so according with the guidance from school we carried on as usual. 3 days later and my partner (35) started feeling under the weather, he described it as ‘the feeling just before you get a cold and tiredness in your body.’ He was poorly but no more than a nasty cold, no cough or temperature, but did lose his sense of smell after 5 days. We kept trying to get a test, but couldn’t obtain them till 7 days later from a school he works at. (which we then tested positive for Covid.)

"""Presumed positive"" is a nightmare..."	So I was sick for about 2 weeks (felt better starting about 5-6 days ago) and I made a telemedicine appointment in the middle there, where they said my symptoms largely matched and to assume I had it and act accordingly. I didn't have a thermometer at the time, but the day I got one in the mail, I measured my temperature at a peak of 99.8. I have OCD and have more or less taken my temperature ever 30 mins (at a very minimum) for about the last 10 days. That first day that I got my thermometer was the highest I'd recorded my temperature since then (until today). Aside from that, my temperature normally stays between 97.8 (immediately after waking up) to 99.2 (usually peak temperature in evening) Today I have measured my temp back up to 99.8, and have been in the 99's most of the day after about noon. I'm starting to realize that I'll constantly be super anxious until this pandemic is over because I'll never know if I did or didn't have it -- unless I get sick enough to go to the hospital, which terrifies me in itself.

Husband Positive	Hey guys! My husband took at COVID test 3 days ago, and it came back positive today. He had a few mild symptoms, fever of 99.1 and nausea. I am completely freaking out. I have anxiety in regards to our health on a regular basis, so this is really got me messed up. What are the chances my daughter and I will test negative? We live in a small house, and she sleeps with us all the time. I have no symptoms. I feel fine. Last week, I noticed a little cough but assumed it was allergies. My daughter has been fine. About a week or so ago, she did complain of some tummy issues but nothing since. She even played soccer today! If I do test positive, will my symptoms get worse? I’m thinking only scary thoughts. Like I have it and won’t wake up in the morning. Someone please help calm my mind.	Husband Positive Hey guys! My husband took at COVID test 3 days ago, and it came back positive today.

Post Covid syndrome in children?	My family were all sick for the entire month of March and into April, presumptive positive. Now I've got a kid with a sudden rash. All the photos of this Kawasaki like syndrome are of white kids so I have nothing accurate to compare the rash to. Anyone out there who dealt with this? Was it an itchy rash? Raised or flat? Other symptoms? I know I'm probably freaking out over nothing. This child is allergic to everything, has eczema, and was outside all day. It's probably allergies. But if they're in this subreddit by any chance, I want to hear from someone who has seen what not-allergies/post covid inflammation syndrome looked like because the news is not helpful.

What if my second test says I’m still positive after weeks of recovery and no symptoms? Am I still contagious?	I only loss my senses as mild symptoms and didn’t have a cough or anything else. I was considered an extremely mild case. I want to return back to work eventually, but I’ve heard it’s a good chance I’m still gonna test positive. Next week would be a whole month since my loss of smell and taste. It will also be 3 weeks since I’ve gained them back, “recovered” with no further symptoms. My question is: guidelines say people should isolate 2 weeks after recovery with no symptoms because most can’t get a second test. They are deemed not contagious by a few weeks. Since you don’t have access to multiple tests that is the rule apparently to be safe. I got my second test and currently awaiting results now. If they say positive, should I have to continue to isolate forever until they come back negative? 2 tests was hard to fight for. Multiple...I don’t know.

Brain issues after week 17?	I got sick in March, male, age 30. Since then I experienced a scary array of symptoms. I had xray and cardiologist saying my organs are fine. Most of these symptoms have disappeared by now (thank god), I no longer have SOB, tightness in chest, fever, loss of smell/taste, tingling in legs and arms, and a few other symptoms. What i still have is brain fog, fatigue, tinnitus, headaches, head pressure which feels like sinus infection, ear pressure, pain behind eyes, dizziness, stiff neck and blurred vision. All of these symptoms comes and goes with exception of the tinnitus. Should I be worried? My doctor wants to see me again next week but I don't know if that's fast enough. I'm afraid I might have/had meningitis but I can't know for sure. Also I don't know what kind of help I can expect. It seems no one knows what to do at this point, other than rest, eat healthy and careful with overextenting the body. Should I get a MRI or CT scan? I have read multiple posts here from people experience similar brain symptoms, getting scans which showed normal results. Maybe this is just the cause of the virus,	Brain issues after week 17?

Possibly asymptomatic	I’m 34F, in good health but I do have pretty bad asthma which is well-controlled with daily meds. We had a trip to the beach planned this weekend with some friends, and each person went to get tested before the trip so we could feel safe and not social distance since we were sharing a condo. I went to an urgent care with drive thru testing, with rapid results. 15 min later the nurse came to my car and told me I was positive. I was so shocked. I did see her swab the guy behind me in line while holding my specimen, so I was convinced she had mixed up our tests. So she tests me again and it’s still positive. Had we not had this trip, I would have never been tested. I didn’t think I had any symptoms, but now that I know, I’m thinking... maybe my throat was sore. I guess I have been a little achy. Definitely been fatigued this week, but I thought it was just from having a busy toddler. No fever, no cough. No major symptoms. Hopefully it stays that way. When did everyone else’s symptoms start?

In the same car as someone that tested positive	Hung out with a friend for about 2 hours, he wasn’t showing any symptoms or anything and said he’d got tested for COVID around the 20th. He said his results hadn’t gotten back yet but the people he hangs out with that were exposed in the same area all came back negative. I didn’t know he hadn’t been quarantining/was even exposed to it til after he was in the car unfortunately but now the situation is that he tested positive 10 days before I met him and his symptoms subsided around 4 days before I met him (he was asymptomatic at the time we hung out.) No facemasks worn and contact was limited to a few handshakes, it’s been 5 days and I don’t have any symptoms and am getting tested Monday but does anyone have any idea what my odds of having it are? I’ve been freaking out about it a little and don’t know how much risk I’m at right now so I’d appreciate the help.

Dominic and Laura made me pizza today	"This is an update from the Dominic and Laura letter post. I have not ""tested positive"" because my country doesn't test unless you're hospitalized, but that was the closest available flair. Sunday evening I took a turn for the worst. My daughter startled me while I was hanging up some clothes and it sent me into a coughing attack. I just couldn't stop coughing and felt my lungs flame up. I called our national healthline, but to summarize what the nurse said-- unless I can't breathe at all, I should just stay home. So I did. Had my ex come pick up our kid and I had a really rough night. The next day, I basically just slept (sitting up because too much coughing laying down). It's lonely without my kiddo, but at least I can focus on getting better. Slowly, slowly I am starting to get better again. Lots of napping and online scrabble ([https://isc.ro/](https://isc.ro/)). My neighbors (whom I've never met) have been awesome and check in with me via sms. Today they made me pizza and left it outside my door. It was delicious. Best neighbors ever!"

The last 2 days I've had a very light headache so light I could barely feel it, it went away around yesterday night but today I was feeling fatigued and it's not really a shortness of breath but my breathing has felt kinda irregular.

I ended up getting tested due to my anxiety and tested negative the first go round.

How do my symptoms compare to your positive covid symptoms?	I learned in late March this year that I had been exposed to a family who visited their sick college son whose college roommate had gone to Wuhan over the holidays and came back sick. I was exposed to them over a period of time in February and they were even at my house twice before I got weird “allergies or a cold.” Back at the end of February, I started to get a sore throat. Then came nasal drip. I could just tip my head down a little and snot would come out like a faucet. Then the diarrhea hit for about a week, and it was very foul smelling! The cough developed with chills but no fever, was cold all the time, and then night sweats. For about three days in a row I woke with my eyes crusted shut and had ear infection type pain come and go. I was not terribly congested but the cough lasted for weeks. Dry, unproductive cough. I lost my sense of smell for a few days as well.

Anyone have weird nerve problems with COVID?	I was just tested last Monday and it came back negative. But I’m wondering if that wasn’t correct. I had a cough like 6 weeks. And it just now is going away. But when I lay down I have this weird feel in my mid back. Like a nerve pulsing or something. And sometimes feel like a shot of adrenaline hits my face and or feel sooo blank. Also I randomly feel like my calf wants to cramp in bed with no activity. Some other parts feels like nerve irritation too.	Anyone have weird nerve problems with COVID? I was just tested last Monday and it came back negative. But I’m wondering if that wasn’t correct.

Question about nasal swab: possible false negative?	Ok so I've been in bed for about a week with symptoms which I'll list at the bottom. It's been a total of 11-12 days since I was exposed to a confirmed positive friend. I was around him for 3 days and we shared drinks. He later told me he was waiting on test results.. I need better friends haha. Also I'm a 25M very active, maybe underweight a bit The main purpose of this post is to ask positive patients how their swab was performed (or anyone who'd like to add input!). I tested negative with a rapid antigen test, but my nose was really dry/congested and she only swabbed the very outside of my nostril. Like she poked the outer roof of my nostril maybe 1-2 centimeters inside and swirled for a second (my nose is pretty big lol). She didn't touch the turbinades at all. I'd know because I have white bumps on them right now that are really painful to touch. It was negative, so they did a backup PCR test and the next lady swabbed the exact same area as the first. Results will take 5-7 days apparently. I'm really afraid to return to work	Question about nasal swab: possible false negative?

Story of how I identified my source, and how my symptoms evolved over time	"Hey curious people. I will present my story chronologically with identifying details removed.

I run a 5km under 23mins, have a BMI around 20, workout 6 days a week, vegetarian diet, no medications, and all vitamin deficiencies are controlled through supplements. Only unhealthy things I do are chug coffee at work, have a cold one with the boys 1-2 times per month, and partake in chocolate when I hate myself. **Day -9** I go out for a drink with some friends. An acquaintance asks if he can bring a friend, and I say, ""Yeah sure mate, no worries"", because I am a nice person.

Would someone with antibodies test positive or negative?	Help me understand this: If they find antibodies from your test, that means you’ve been exposed and are immune/building immunity. But you still technically have it, and can spread it- therefore it should show up as positive, yes? But once you’ve developed antibodies, you have those antibodies forever; that would mean you’ll always test positive for COVID. But a vaccine, which literally gives you the virus (so you’ll build antibodies) is supposed to prevent you from getting COVID. Even those who are asymptomatic, can still spread it.

I was Interrupted by someone else another story for another time. Anyways i woke up with a sore throat that feels like bronchitis like I can talk it still feels normal but it feels Scratchy and ichy. Not burning, Headaches, and a fever. I don't have a thermometer at the moment. but i can easily tell Because my head feels really hot. and my body feels really hot too. I got diarrhea and chills as well. My previous symptoms Were chronic fatigue, stuffed nose, and nausea. I Had those since July. but this I only had it early this morning I'm pretty sure on how I got it. I just have to avoid this person as much as I can because this person's not doing what he or she is supposed to be doing	has anyone else had these symptoms?

Is covid active in body even after a month ?	My father tested positive via rtpcr almost one month back His condition was quite bad at that time he had 0 energy kept shivering and had continuous fevers He Is on treatment and medication since then and currently home quarantine. But he feels 50 - 60% better now with a little coughing. He says that it's been a month and we should be relaxed now as corona must have been gone now as said by his peers to him. I wanted to know is that true or we should still be taking precautions.	Is covid active in body even after a month ?

Should I be working or taking time to rest? (WFH)	My mother was tested on Monday, with test results coming yesterday morning. We have not been isolating as it is difficult to do in this household from one another. My symptoms have been very mild for me, with a sore throat, occasional dry cough, and periods of feeling warm. I still feel well enough to work, as I work from home (I do medical coding for air ambulances), but am wondering if I should be resting up instead. I spoke to my manager and she said I can take paid administrative leave if I had any symptoms. Thanks in advance!	Should I be working or taking time to rest?

anyone got insurance to cover portable condenser?	my wife tested positive in late april, was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks. she still needs 3L of oxygen at home. for going out the oxygen delivery company gives us D size tanks and a backpack. those seem to be about 30 pounds. has anyone gotten their insurance to cover a portable condenser like Phillips or Innogen ? we hope that she will not need oxygen forever so we dont want to rush into paying $2000-3000 out of pocket. but getting out and getting exercise is super important as she would like to return to work someday. she has private insurance through her employer.	anyone got insurance to cover portable condenser? my wife tested positive in late april, was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks. she still needs 3L of oxygen at home. for going out the oxygen delivery company gives us D size tanks and a backpack. those seem to be about 30 pounds. has anyone gotten their insurance to cover a portable condenser like Phillips or Innogen ? we hope that she will not need oxygen forever so we dont want to rush into paying $2000-3000 out of pocket. but getting out and getting exercise is super important as she would like to return to work someday. she has private insurance through her employer.	2
How long did you have to wait to get tested?	"Potentially exposed, family is trying to figure out ""exposure time"" or when is the soonest we can get tested to get accurate results. For example, being exposed to someone with COVID usually means you can't just go and get tested the next day. I know incubation can be 7-14 days so then the question is how long to wait initially? Thank you all, stay positive and strong. 🙌"	"How long did you have to wait to get tested?

For positive folks, how long until a negative test?	Juuuust curious. How long after your exposure/symptoms/positive did you get a negative? Still waiting on the neg?

Why are doctors still prescribing Ibuprofen and Tylenol when it said to have the opposite effect if you have COVID-19??	Almost every case I have read on here has doctors or nurses prescribing Ibuprofen or Tylenol for the patients fever. I keep reading countless articles how it makes COVID-19 worse. Whats the deal here? Is there any reason why doctors will still give it to you knowing it might make things way worse?

How long until I can get back to work?	I originally tested positive on August 20, three weeks later I was feeling ok but still tested positive Sept 10, then 3 weeks later I STILL tested positive. Can it be a false positive? Am I still contagious? Can I go back to work? (I work with elderly people) Do I need to disinfect my house to test negative? I've been sleeping with the same pillow since I got sick and I haven't been as tidy as I should, I live alone and depression is tough. I still get those random body aches mainly in my joints although they're not really severe.	How long until I can get back to work?

Still waiting on test results. Your thoughts?	"I've had some symptoms that line up with Covid, and my wife is following suit with more soreness and a bad headache. Day 1: Started out with very swollen lymph nodes and lethargy. Symptoms somewhat abated by the end of the day. Pretty bad tendon soreness in my wrist/arm and random twinges of pain in my body. Day 2: Started getting a runny nose, scratchy throat, and sinus headache/burning. The biggest surprise was when I went to feed my daughter pancakes in the morning. I told my wife ""no wonder she isn't eating these, they're super bland."" Turns out I couldn't taste the syrup. I then tried a big glob of it and could only taste the texture, hardly any sweetness at all. Tried a bunch of different stuff and discovered that my sense of taste for salty and sweet stuff was greatly diminished. Got a very sore throat/trachea that night. Hurt very much to swallow. Day 3: Mostly sinus headache, snottiness, and off and on low-grade fever. This night I could NOT stop sneezing, felt like my nasal cavity and sinuses were burning, developed a cough with a small amount of production. Day 4: Symptoms have mostly diminished.

Long Termer Tested Negative For IgG Antibodies	Some background, I'm a healthy/athletic 28M who started to feel symptoms in the middle of March this year. Like many other long-termers on this sub, it has been a rollercoaster of good weeks and bad weeks. Last week I finally gave in and got an antibody test done at Quest Diagnostics (IgG test). Based off of how long I had waited to get the test done (it had been about 9 weeks at this time), I was sure that it would come back positive. Nope. Doctor's office called and notified me that it had come back negative. What does this mean? This is the second time I've gotten a negative test back (first being the PCR) and makes me believe that either these tests are a waste of time or that my body is not fighting this thing properly. Am I susceptible of getting more sick the more I'm around Covid (grocery stores, ect.)? I plan on demanding a CT scan for my lungs this week, as well as a D-Dimer test for any potential clotting.

Risk of long-term lung damage in otherwise healthy person	Hi there, I've been positive just over two weeks with relatively mild symptoms as far as fever and cough go. However, I have felt my lung directly affected from day 2 with shortness of breath, tiredness, and general lack of energy. Luckily, my lung symptoms have not required medical attention. However, after over two weeks of just resting at home, my lung has not actually improved. I've tried to stay away from Covid19 posts to avoid triggering anxiety, but what I am wondering are the following questions on which a fact-based answer would help me: 1. Is there a risk I already have a pneumonia? 2. More importantly, is there a risk to long-term lung damage from pulmonary fibrosis? 3. If pulmonary fibrosis is a risk, is there any diagnostic (e.g., a lung CT) or action I can take that would reduce the risk? I am an otherwise healthy and active 30 something who has never smoked. Thx	Risk of long-term lung damage in otherwise healthy person Hi there, I've been positive just over two weeks with relatively mild symptoms as far as fever and cough go.

Allergies or COVID?	"I have really bad allergies all year round. Any slight change is air pressure will trigger it. A few days ago I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my throat and a slight sore throat due to mucus drainage. My voice was a little altered and I was foggy. I don't have a thermometer, but my forehead felt warm-ish. My nodes and the sore throat subsided throughout the day. These are all pretty par for the course for my allergies. The next day I had the same symptoms except much milder, and I wasn't foggy anymore and didn't feel warm. This morning, same thing, and I'm pretty much back to normal other than lingering tender lymph nodea. I went and got tested on the first day and I'm still awaiting my results.

Roommate sharing my status with other people.	I tested positive earlier this month. I’ve been asymptomatic the entire time. Told my roommates immediately. The only other people I’ve shared with were my parents and my employer. quarantined myself in my room and started masking up around the house, extra wiping down surfaces, and spending way too much on Ubereats because i was being considerate of my roommates in our common spaces. I couldn’t even pet our kitty and she usually always sleeps with me :( The day before i received my initial positive result i had a friend over to the apartment. My roommate decided to reach out to this person and share my personal medical information with them before i had a chance to speak to them. This person immediately messaged me and wanted to know why they were hearing this from my roommate and not me. Now i feel like a bad, shady person for not telling them first. Both of my roommates have tested negative and so has my boyfriend. I took another test 11 days after the first test and that one was negative. I feel extremely violated.

Please tell me about your loss of taste and smell!!	Question for those who have lost their taste/smell. On Friday (7/24) I ended up vomiting in the middle of the night (about six hours after ending a day of fairly heavy drinking). I know this is gross, but I ate some spicy foods and the vomit unfortunately came up through my nose and I spent the rest of the night with burning nasal passages and congestion. The next morning I woke up with 0 sense of taste or smell. I ate a salad and could not differentiate between a red onion or green olive. The ranch dressing had zero taste. I have continually tested my taste/smell since then, and I have gotten to the point that I can smell and taste most things, but when I try certain foods there’s a strange taste that masks what it’s supposed to taste like. Has anyone had an experience with losing their smell/taste partially or is it typically a total loss? I only added the gross story of me vomiting as I’m praying the loss of senses was caused by that and not COVID. I was tested on Monday 7/27 and I am anxiously awaiting my results.

Anyone else with Post-COVID Inflammation After Recovery??	Hi everyone! I haven’t posted in here before, but I am really struggling with feeling fully like myself since being presumed to have COVID back in March. For the past two weeks, I have had a slight, very occasional dry cough, fatigue, my lymph nodes/neck generally feel swollen, and my stomach is beyond bloated and upset. But, I have tested negative for active COVID infection when I got tested last week. I am wondering if what I am feeling now could be a post-COVID inflammatory episode given that I was presumed to have COVID back in March. Has anyone who recovered from COVID had any similar experiences? Further context: I was not officially tested since this was back when it was highly restricted, but I was exposed to someone who had it and developed some mild symptoms. I felt fully back to normal after 3.5 weeks and have felt fine for about 2+ months until this recent Illness and right now actually feels worse than when I was sick back in March. Wondering if I’m alone in having this recurrence...	Anyone else with Post-COVID Inflammation After Recovery?? Hi everyone!

Mild covid or something else and my country's awful healthcare	Hi everyone, I'm 21 fairly healthy male. After the first week in uni with mandatory masks and me constantly disinfecting my hands I started having a sore throat on Sunday night. Throughout the next day I developed my other symptoms, slight temperature increase (37 celsius ish), constant headaches that are worse when laying down, sweating, fatigue and sore throat. It's been like 4 days now, my symptoms havent really changed or gotten better. I'd love to get tested but here in Budapest, Hungary they don't even test you unless you've had high fever and a cough or shortness of breath for 3-4 days. My doctor told me the ambulance she sent to a patient for a Monday test still hasn't arrived on Wednesday that's how full capacity they are. No contact tracing, nothing. Anyone here who has had covid with similar symptoms and could tell me how it went would be appreciated. Or if anyone had these symptoms but tested negative. Cheers.

Post-infection dysautonomia: If you still feel awful months after testing positive this is for you.	I used to be a two sport athlete. I was vivacious and active all the time. Then a viral infection wrecked me and decided to take up residence in my stomach for two months. Even after the virus was gone I was still feeling bad. Couldn’t stand up for too long. Couldn’t work out anymore. Some days barely had the energy to walk to the bathroom. This is happening with covid patients too, and I promise it’s NOT in your head. You are NOT “just out of shape”. If this sounds like you, you might have something called post infection dysautonomia or secondary dysautonomia. It is a very real condition that can be treated. Look into it and get your general doctor as well as any specialists to look into it as well.	Post-infection dysautonomia: If you still feel awful months after testing positive this is for you.

Positive and confused.	So, on July 19th, I was at work (Hospital) and started feeling like I was coming down with a cold. That Monday I was off but felt reasonably better. My husband had text me saying he went to go get tested cause he didn’t feel well. Tuesday morning I wake up for work and can’t catch my breath. After making it to work, I just felt exhausted and my boss sent me to get tested. I got a positive result on Wednesday and it was weird because I felt completely fine. Everyday after that has been up and down. One day fine, another day not fine. What’s consistent is my fatigue. I’m always wanting to lay down. My husband tested positive this past friday 7/24 and his symptoms went from extreme to completely fine. I now have a stuffy/runny nose and dehydration. I just feel like I don’t know what to do to make myself better. They told me after 10 days I should be fine but I don’t think I’m getting better. Anyone else feel this way?	Positive and confused.

Declining vision?	Has anyone else experienced blurry vision? I had eye pain and clear eye snot at the beginning of illness. Vision became a little blurry. But, it has significantly declined to the point my glasses don't work properly anymore. Going to contact my doctor Monday. I know impaired vision can be a thing after certain viruses. It can be part of post viral arthritis, which I also developed. I had a minor distance prescription that I only needed for reading small road signs at night. Now i have double vision with my glasses and everything starts to blur maybe 10 feet in front of me.	Declining vision? Has anyone else experienced blurry vision?

My friend's parents are probably covid+ and doing poorly, it's my friend's fault, I'm thinking of going no-contact but am conflicted.	"Hope this post is allowed. I wanted to get opinions of people who ""get"" covid. I'm a long-hauler, six months in today. My case is mild but I still have some symptoms and sequelae. Overall I'm lucky since my quality of life is still good (not like some people on r/covidlonghaulers who still can't breathe properly :( ). A friend of mine (38F) is dumb as fuck. She never took covid seriously (although her country was and is very affected). She lives with her parents, they are 77 (mother) and 81 (father). Her mum has heart problems, severe asthma (so severe she has a CPAP machine and uses it several times a day), obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Her dad has stomach cancer and high blood pressure (he might have other things, I'm not sure). So they are obviously very at risk and it was known from the start, even when it was believed that covid was a big deal only for the elderly/immunocompromised. Said friend broke lockdown to hook up with a guy (and came back home after!! Although there was obviously no way to know if the guy was infected!!). After lockdown, she started living normal life"	"My friend's parents are probably covid+ and doing poorly, it's my friend's fault, I'm thinking of going no-contact but am conflicted.

105 days post-Covid- Hope for long haulers!	I finally reached 105 days of recovery from COVID. The last month has been absolute hell with the worst migraines I have ever experienced. However, my respiratory symptoms seem to have eased up a little. I'm not quite as out of breath from walking from the kitchen to the bedroom, and I recovered from a flare up much faster than previously. It's a small difference, but it's huge when I can finally walk to the kitchen and back without needing to lie down and rest afterwards. I have been taking all kinds of vitamins and supplements, but I'm not entirely sure if any of it helped. I suspect that maybe the low dose aspirin and the mullein herbal tincture were probably the most helpful. The rest of the symptoms are still a huge annoyance, the headaches, dry painful eyes, fatigue, itchy skin, heart racing, etc. BUT my lungs feel distinctly better and a lot less pain with breathing.	105 days post-Covid- Hope for long haulers!

7 weeks in with persistent flue like symptoms. The Swedish healthcare system refuses to test me.	Started having flu like symptoms back in beginning of March. Intermittent fever, shortness of breath, rapid and irregular heart beat, muscle pains, ear pain, chills etc. Two weeks ago I had 5 days of feeling normal and then symptoms returned again. Rapid and irregular heart beat when active, intensive muscle and joint pain every day, headaches, rashes, red feet/toes, shortness of breath mostly when speaking(!) and back pain. I have been in contact with my local clinic. The first three weeks I was advised to stay home. Last week I decided to get checked at the local clinic. EKG looked normal. Lungs sounded normal. They tested me for a bacterial infection which came back negative. I asked them for a corona test and the said no, they only test people admitted to ICU basically. I'm now 7 weeks in and I still have persistent flu like symptoms, with the exception that I now have a dry cough and mucus in my throat. It's not a constant cough but damn it hurts to cough.

Friends trying to be helpful but making me feel a bit crazy...	"I started showing symptoms two days ago and was tested yesterday. Test results take 2-10 days I guess so technically I don't know that what I'm experiencing is COVID, but I have so many symptoms that it feels silly to pretend that I don't have it. I come from a family where the best thing to do when you're sick is pretend you're not sick and keep working until you literally fall over. I cancelled everything I had planned when I started experiencing symptoms, and was already feeling a lot of guilt from that. Now friends and family are trying to be supportive by saying that hopefully it's not COVID or even that they're ""certain"" it isn't COVID, questioning my symptoms, questioning where I could have gotten it, etc. It's already so hard for me to take symptoms of anything seriously without everyone I know basically telling me I'm not feeling what I'm feeling. Does anyone else have experience with this or advice on what to say when people do this?"	"Friends trying to be helpful but making me feel a bit crazy...

So far somewhat mild case/symptoms	Preface: awaiting results. I haven’t had any exposure to positively tested people, only my family, however as we have seen that doesn’t rule out possible infection. Here’s my timeline of symptoms: Friday October 2: Excruciating headache behind eyes almost like a burning sensation. Fatigue Saturday October 3: Same headache, mild fever 99.6, chills, sweating an abnormal amount. Extreme fatigue/can’t do anything. Sleep all day. No appetite during day but starving late at night. Sunday October 4: Same symptoms as Saturday. Sleep all day. Eat one meal through the day. Got tested. Monday October 5: Cold and flu medicine seem to have relieved most symptoms. Have more energy. Walk around the neighborhood to get some sunshine(it’s still 75 here in VA). Awaiting results. Mild fever 99.4 Anyone have similar symptoms. No major fever, cough, shortness of breath. So far it’s not been too bad, but I’m only on day 4. Taking vitamin C, Zinc, and vitamin D.	So far somewhat mild case/symptoms Preface: awaiting results.

And i have a bit of pain when i roll my eyeball up, but i didnt get enough sleep due to my anxiety. I had slept 2 out of 24 hours.

My partner made me feel like shit (guilty) about being ill with the flu last month. Now I’m Covid19+ and stressed/sad af over how they’re going to treat me. Advice please?	For clarity, my partner isn’t abusive or really even a jerk about much else- but he definitely does really suck when it comes to me not feeling well. He is a germaphobe even when a global pandemic isn’t requiring him to be, and he can be pretty mean about it. It was his idea for us to quarantine together in his one bedroom apartment in upstate New York and every time I stay here I feel like a huge bother and sincerely unwelcome. Anyway, I wish I could just teleport back to my own apartment because being alone with no one to care for me would be less stressful than being ill in his home. But going home would require driving 2hrs back to the NYC-area with my carsick cat while sick af. Sorry guys, idek what type of advice I’m looking for here. I’m just sad as fuck that he’s going to make me feel so badly about falling ill.	My partner made me feel like shit (guilty) about being ill with the flu last month.

Idea: When You Go To The Hospital, Why Dont They Take All Blood Donation Then And There At The Hospital? If You Have It, It Can Be Used For Antibodies, And If Not, It Could Be a Regular Donation?	Ok, so I am writing here because I dont know how many of you went to the hospital or how soon after you found out that you were positive. I wanted to get an idea of that time frame. All the best!

Strange symptoms	I’m (36f)on day 5 of symptoms with a positive test. My bf (41) is on day 7, test results pending. My symptoms are completely different then his. Mine started with sinus congestion, mild body aches, super sensitive skin (felt like I had a sun burn), complete loss of smell, blurred vision and overall floaty feeling. Sounds like a lot but these were all pretty mild. Definitely not the sickest I’ve ever been. My boyfriend is the more classic headache, cough, low fever and lung congestion. He has been fever free for 2 days but has now developed a new symptom of not feeling like he can keep warm. He will have blankets piled on and is freezing cold. His skin is warm and no fever. Anyone had anytime similar? I can’t find any info on this. Also seems his symptoms come and go. I have been getting better day by day but he seems to be okay for a few days and then feels like crap again.	Strange symptoms I’m (36f)on day 5 of symptoms with a positive test.

Question for those who have teens that tested positive.	So I haven't let my daughter go anywhere. I recently let her go out with one person. Now she has the sniffles headache and throat pain. No fever. Should I get her tested? She said it feels like a cold. But I'm freaking out.	Question for those who have teens that tested positive. So I haven't let my daughter go anywhere.

My story of my Mom (F58), myself (M19) and my twin brother (M19) all having the coronavirus	*Let me start this by saying my mother’s case is presumed, there were no tests in Michigan in early April* - - - My mom (slightly overweight, type 2 diabetes) came home from work on March 27 (a Friday) with very mild cold like symptoms, thinking it was allergies from spring she decided to wait it out at home and rest up over the weekend which worked, and she was 100% by Monday (the 30th) and went back to work. But then on that Thursday she was hit by a brick wall and was becoming very sick, very fast. By that Saturday (April 4) she was at her worst symptoms such as: Terrible headache, cough, and fatigue.

Coincidentally that same day I started to get headaches, and by that next Monday (April 6th) I had a fever and fatigue and absolutely no appetite with a slight cough.

Advice for getting compensated for positive test results greater than 14 days in NYS.	I was tested positive on 04/25/20. My symptoms resolved after 2 1/2 weeks and I returned to work (nursing home) after 3 weeks off. I was back to work for 1 week and, due to new twice weekly mandatory testing in NYS, I was tested positive again (despite having no symptoms) and required to quarantine for 2 more weeks. My employer just told me they are only obligated to compensate me for 14 days under the current laws. I am able to use my PTO, which will only cover 17 hours. I have searched around the internet for any advice with this circumstance to no avail. Does anyone here have any knowledge or information on potential recourse for compensation either with my employer or some other entity (short-term disability, etc.)? Thanks!

Tested Negative - Thought it was covid but most likely fall allergies.	Had this weird thing in the back of my throat where it felt like I had to clear it every hour or so. Started last Tuesday and didn’t progress at all till Sunday . On Friday and Saturday I did go to her at 4 am so I was more tired then usual. Woke up on Sunday feeling the normal but chest was a little sore. Not weird for me since I wake up with this feeling often and it usually goes away which it did. Rest of the day it was just a slight uncomfortable feeling in my sinuses and chest a little. I’ve noticed the longer I stay up the more uncomfortable the throat thing gets. I didn’t get enough sleep the past 2 days (Friday and Saturday) so I decided to get some well needed rest. Went to bed at 1 am so a little late still and couldn’t fall to sleep till 3 am. I suffer from insomnia sometimes and the throat thing was uncomfortable so I took a NyQuil and went to sleep. Monday morning I wake up feeling normal but the throat thing was still there.

How long for brainfog to go away?	About a month ago I started experiencing brainfog. Two weeks later I tested positive. Today I tested and I finally have antibodies but I am still positive. At first I had headaches and brainfog almost constsntly. Now the frequecncy lessened, but I am afraid this is permanent. Has this gotten better for anyone (by that I mean completely gone away) ?

What were your fist symptoms?	My boyfriend is a hypochondriac, so a pandemic has been a real strain on his mental health. He’s often worried that he has covid.

Could my symptoms be Covid?	So about two days ago I started feeling super fatigued. So I went and got a covid test yesterday... (will find out in 3 days) Today I am still super fatigued with some mild body aches and pains. I just have this over all sick feeling I can’t explain. My temp is 99.1 today and I’ve just been taking Tylenol and resting. Does this sound like it could be Covid? Or fighting off something else? These are the only symptoms I’ve had- oh and a swollen throat feeling sometimes.	Could my symptoms be Covid? So about two days ago I started feeling super fatigued.

What to do when your loved one gets worse?	My mom, who doesn't live with me, hasn't been giving me a lot of details about her condition. At first my mother told me she was sick, then she told me that she was covid-19 positive. However, today she finally told me she experiencing pain and a fever. She is having a hard time eating. This is not like her at all. I cried when she first told me she was positive. Later I came here and you all gave me some encouraging words. I had some confidence that she would get better, but instead the opposite happened. The first few days her condition did not display a lot of symptoms.	What to do when your loved one gets worse?

The low back pain is unbearable	My fever has broken this morning although I do believe I feel it creeping back up. I just began to show symptoms Friday night. My legs and hips and basically all over has been incredibly achy with the fever. I toss and I turn and I cannot get Comfortable or stay asleep for very long. This morning I wake up feeling better except the low back pain. It’s excruciating! I can’t lay down, I can’t stand up, it hurts constantly. Across my lower back, deep inside, and it catches my breath it’s so intense. I don’t think it’s my kidneys as it’s too low. Is this a normal symptom. Has anyone else had this awful unbearable pain?

Does anyone here think the caught it at the supermarket?	EDIT: Does anyone here think THEY caught it at the supermarket. My household has been very strict for this entire time. We were getting grocery delivery or pickup for a while, with my dad doing the rare shopping that required him to enter a store as he's over 60, and while at risk, it seemed safer for him to go during senior hours rather than my going during regular hours. Now we're getting a little more adventurous I guess, we've stopped pickup and delivery and mostly my dad goes during senior hours. Coming here and reading some of these posts has me really worried! I initially came to ask if anyone here thinks the caught it from a trip to the grocery store, but now I'm wondering if we should go back to delivery? Mainly I really want to go someplace like Whole Foods to get some really specific items that I like to have around... but now I'm rethinking... For grocery trips, whoever goes (mostly my dad) wears a mask, gloves I think but I'm not sure and washes all of the items down in the garage upon return.... and then showers. Is that reasonable?

Possibly COVID positive - can anyone relate to my symptoms?	I got told today by my doctor's office they would not take me, due to having flu-like symptoms. So I've been having really bad anxiety attacks after I got off the phone with the nurse's hotline, I'm having such a bad time coping and it's literally been a few hours. I think I'm freaking out because I'm overweight, asthmatic (prone to bronchitis) and I also have hypochondria due to anxiety. Runny, intensely itching and burning eyes - kinda with some gunk in the mornings. Runny and congested nose as of yesterday night, lots of sneezing, my face is itchy as is my throat. And you know that weird sick feeling you get when you have a cold or flu? That as well. Hot flashes, now my throat feels as if it wants to start feeling slightly scratchy.. I keep trying to tell myself it's hay fever (because I got it frequently before, mainly in spring/summer) and this will just go away. However, deep down I think I may of contracted it - I'm scared my kid and SO might catch it, I don't know what to do and freaking out I'll be that small % of people who pass.

Red, bumpy, swollen hands	I got my positive test today after 3 days of mild symptoms including loss of smell and taste.

Have any idea what is causing it or an idea for treatment?	Red, bumpy, swollen hands I got my positive test today after 3 days of mild symptoms including loss of smell and taste.

Mild case symptoms?	I'm on day three of whatever this is. I was supposed to have a Covid test today, but dumbass me overslept, so I had to reschedule for Sunday.

Today I wake up and I feel about the same except I now have muscle aches in my back, neck, and arms. It's situational, in that I need to move my arm to make it ache, and my back and neck only hurt in certain positions. So that could be part of a chronic muscle pains I've had. I have no fever and my mucus is clear. Does this sound like anything anybody experienced?.	Mild case symptoms? I'm on day three of whatever this is.

A rant about fomo/fear in isolation.	I feel like life has been stolen from me and so many others who have this virus. Aside from the physical toll, I'm really having trouble with the mental strife of this virus and isolation isn't helping that aspect. My social media feeds are full of friends taking trips, going to each other's houses and I am at my wits end with this fomo. It's this strange juxtaposition of feelings because I'm also absolutely terrified that any of those friends could be catching the virus with all the socializing they're doing. I'm trying hard to gripe at anyone for their choices but it stings. I'm trapped at home, hoping to get better, and so many people are living their life like nothing is wrong. In the US we have absolutely been let down by our government, which has made things much worse and I have no idea when life will be able to return to normal. I'm so tired. I just want to feel better.

My symptoms (rough)	About me 26 y/o Healthy Daily excercising No underlying illnesses No medicine So, last monday i woke up and felt normal, i went for my daily hourly swim and it went good I went to work feeling good. At 8 pm, it all caved down. First my hips, knees and lower back got painfull. After that, i started having chills. Longues got painfull. I rushed Home from work, i have three flights of stairs to my appartment. But i had to take 3 breaks to have the energy to get up. I came Home and took my temp. 38,4 the first time, i retook it 1h later and had 39.3 I filled 5 1,5l bottles of water preparing for the worst. The following Three Days were a fever induced blur. Fever in the 40's pain, dry cough. I have a faint memory of calling the chrisis number to ask whether i should test myself or not. But since I'm not in a risk group, the answer was a no. On thursday, my jointache had subsided, my longue pain had intensified. Friday night, i almost called the emergency, i could breathe, but i had the feeling i was not getting enough	Covid19?

Weird Covid Timeline	Hi everyone, &amp;#x200B; I spent a week in NYC in mid-march, two days after I came back to Brazil on March 16, I had the first symptoms. So here's my weird timeline that I didn't understand until I found out about this subreddit. &amp;#x200B; * March 14 - I arrived in Brazil * March 16 - First symptoms (short of breath and eventual coughs) * March 17 - I went to the Hospital. The Doctor said it could be Covid-19 but the protocol had changed and they only tested the worst cases. He sent me back home and told me to take Tylenol and only go back to the hospital if the symptoms got worse. * March 18 -23 - Short of breath, headaches, low fever, and a lot of joint pains too. * Around March 20 - I noticed that my sense of smell had vanished. * April 22 - Short of breath got worse. I Went back to the hospital and finally got tested. RT-PCR positive, a small stain on my lung but both IgG and IgM were negative. The Doctor gave me a lot of antibiotics for 10 days and I got a little better and then	Weird Covid Timeline Hi everyone, &amp;#x200B; I spent a week in NYC in mid-march, two days after I came back to Brazil on March 16, I had the first symptoms.

10 days since symptoms. I am getting sick of being sick!	Just wanting to vent! Still waiting for results. Can someone please tell me that the body aches stop at some point? No nsaid/aspirin seems to help much with that. I feel good for a few hours in the morning, then it hits like a truck, and arms and legs start aching real bad. To top it off, I am all alone now, as my wife had to go to CA two weeks ago for a family health crisis. Just need someone who went through this to tell me they are OK.	10 days since symptoms.

⚠️ HOW PAINFUL WAS YOUR SWAB?	I just wanted to breach this subject per my conversation with another poster. Personally my test was something I would not wish on my worst enemy. I’m used to pain, frequent hospitalization, daily injections and have quite a high pain tolerance due to my disease. But holy hell this was a pain like no other. 🔥 The deeper they went, the more it burned. Once they met resistance they slowly swirled and continued until they met further resistance, swirled again and by that time the back of my neck burned so badly I was in tears and in so much pain. An ice pack on the neck behind the side swabbed helped the pain but then it was in the eye. They mentioned tears were the goal and that’s how they knew they hit the target depth. The nurses said my reaction was similar to everyone swabbed and the pain would take hours to a day to subside. My results have yet to come back. So I would like to know how bad your test was and how it was performed? Do you feel it was done correctly?

Should I get tested? 7-10 Day Result time	Friday I started feeling sick. Runny nose with a slight cough. Saturday is when I felt actually sick. Dry cough, wheezing, that “off” feeling you get when you have a cold. Sunday, same thing for the most part. An intensified cough, nothing else new. Monday, much better, not as bad of a cough. Still wheezing, no headaches or crazy aches. And today, still have wheezing, cough up phlegm which had a little blood in it, a couple dots I’d say. My highest temps recorded these last couple days was 99.3 with no fever reducer. My temp today has varied between 98.8-99.1. My girlfriend is now starting to show symptoms of being sick as well. She came over Friday, and is now sick today. I’m on the fence of this being a regular cold and not covid 19. Should we get tested? We literally don’t go anywhere, and the only place we went to was the grocery store a week before on a Saturday. We had our mask, used proper sanitation and such. The turn around times for test near me are pretty much almost 2 weeks, and if I have it, it’ll most likely pass or I’ll end up in	Should I get tested? 7-10 Day Result time Friday I started feeling sick.

Grandfather Passed Suddenly, Grandmother Tested Positive, parent exposed, looking for a strategy	Hello all, A little backstory: My grandfather and grandmother both live in an assisted living facility in New England. On April 12, we were informed that my grandfather had not eaten anything in about a day. He had advanced dementia and usually had a year round cough. He was alert as late as April 13th, but on April 15th, he declined quickly, stopped speaking and passed away that night. In my state, exceptions to the no visitation orders are made for end of life, so my father and my two aunts went to visit him. They all wore surgical masks. Luckily, my governor was prioritizing testing for all assisted living and nursing home residents to move them into covid 19 only facilities to slow the spread through assisted living and nursing homes. Unfortunately today, we found out today that she was positive. So far, she's likely on day 8 of exposure and is so far asymptomatic. We hope she stays that way, she will likely be moved to another facility with covid patients this week. While we can't know for sure if my grandfather passed due to covid (they are not testing him postmortem), my family and the assisted living	Grandfather Passed Suddenly, Grandmother Tested Positive, parent exposed, looking for a strategy Hello all, A little backstory: My grandfather and grandmother both live in an assisted living facility in New England.

Two extremely unusual symptoms - Tenesmus and Burning Urethra	I noticed that I have 2 weird symtpoms not mentioned in here. That is I feel like I need to take a dump all the time (rectal fullness) and recently I developed the most excruciating symtpom I ever had. I have constant feeling of needing to pee and burning in my urethra. It is insane. Literally insane. The only thing that helps is sitting in warm bath. Literally this is the only thing that helps. My brainfog is gone and my headache is gone, but it seems that this COVID is gift that keeps on giving.

Nervous about a false negative and what other health condition it could be	Hello all, I'm honestly a little nervous that I tested negative for covid because it doesn't explain why I randomly fell ill last week. It started with nausea that followed with a sore throat, and shortly after that a fever of 101 came on and lasted for two days. I had tremors, dizziness, night sweats, a cough, body aches, fatigue, and an intense headache that would ache every time I walked anywhere. I felt really winded and delusional. My breathing was a little short but that could have been from anxiety. I was very sick for like four days and then abruptly got better. My doctor prescribed me antibiotics in case it's a bacteria infection like strep and I took them, so I'm not sure if that is what made me improve so fast. I just feel somewhat worried because it's weird to get so sick for a short period of time. I live in NYC and have been in contact with a few people and rode the train once, but how likely would it be for me to pick up other illnesses at this time? I guess on one hand I'm worried that I did have covid and that	Nervous about a false negative and what other health condition it could be Hello all, I'm honestly a little nervous that I tested negative for covid because it doesn't explain why I randomly fell ill last week.

Figuring out symptoms from an old sickness. Covid? Mono?	Back in February I came down with the most horrendous sickness I’ve ever experienced which ended around March with a two month fatigue recovery period. With the lack of Covid research and testing back then I had made a best guess assumption at mononucleosis once the virus was over. At the time I should’ve really gotten a mono test and post-symptoms antibody test but I was too confused about what it was and anxious in my symptoms (will not make that mistake again). I did visit an urgent care but they simply ruled out strep. So, I come here asking if anyone confirmed positive has experienced similar. Of course the medical professionals know best, I’m just curious to know if my symptoms were alike in any way to Covid cases. For context, I’m a 25 year old woman with no pre-existing conditions, medications, or susceptibilities. The worst sickness I had before this was the flu at 12.

But i have diarrhoea and massive headache. My oxygen saturation is 97-99. And i don’t have problems breathing. What do you guys suggest? Should I go to the red zone for a test again? Or stay home?

Waiting on covid test and was wondering if anyone had symptoms like this who has gotten it.	I was around two co workers who tested positive so i am worried i got it now to since i got sick. Waiting on my covid test right now and was wondering if anyone had symptoms like this. Started with a bad headache and feeling like just bleh. Haven't had a fever but, will wake up just drenched in sweat last two days. Nasal congestion and little bit of sore throat with pressure behind my eyes. The one thing that scared me was my tatse and smell is haywire because everything but vape and milk taste ok to me everything else taste like eating garbage. I love to drink monsters even if I have cold before they never tasted bad to me but last 2 days I took a sip and tasted so bad to me I dumped it out. No cough or fever just occasional feel so hot then I get little bit of chills here and there to. I am hoping if I got it I got lucky and this will be my only symptoms and will not get any worse.

I think I lost me smell and taste, anyone who recovered ?	Im pretty sure I lost most of my smell senses and I can't taste salt in most of the foods, I'm not sure if it's cuz there was actually less salt everytime or I lost my senses.

COVID Symptoms &amp; Testing Negative	I've had a low grade fever for a week now, tested negative right before symptoms started. Early on experienced fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea. I started to feel better 4-5 days in, but the low grade fever has persisted and I've now started having headaches, more of a cough, and some chest tightness. My 2nd test from 3 days ago just came back negative. I kinda feel like I'm going crazy at this point. I'm scared to be around too many people in case I have it and can give it to them, but if I actually had it, wouldn't at least one test come back positive? Would it even make sense to get tested again? Why am I having these symptoms if I don't have COVID?

Definitely made out with my new husband a lot before receiving a positive test result (him, negative). Do we need to isolate from each other?	Title basically sums it up! We got married about 3.5 weeks ago. Neither of us were experiencing any symptoms, but were hoping to go visit my grandparents so decided to get tested just to be on the safe side. I tested positive, husband tested negative. Between getting tested and getting the results, we definitely made out a lot and were in no way respecting any sort of distance (hooray for being newlyweds!). He is convinced that he would have gotten it by now, and that it would be pointless to isolate from each other. I, on the other hand, keep running away from his hugs and kisses, trying to protect him. I've read a few posts on here about isolating from your significant other, but it seemed most of them had symptoms at the time of getting tested, so were already taking precautions. Have any of you been in a similar situation as us? Did you end up isolating even though you had clearly shared germs since testing positive?

Went to Florida, Was Not the Right Choice	Hey Everybody, Me and my buddies went to Florida June 11th and just got back Sunday. During that time- Florida (specifically Tampa) the area where we were had a spike. It also started Saturday June 13th when we were at a packed bar in Tampa. The very next day I had a sore throat. I had a sore throat and was feeling tired for 3 days before I went to urgent care. I went and tested positive for strep. Around the same time, my one buddy started complaining of bad headaches for days and my other buddy developed a rash that urgent care didn't know what it was. &amp;#x200B; Long story short that was the extent of my symptoms, but yesterday my buddy who was on the trip started running a fever and got tested and tested positive. With all this information me and my buddies have all most likely had covid since June 13th when we contracted it at the bar in Tampa. It was later released that that bar had a few bartenders test positive and has since closed. I feel relatively fine, currently taking penicillin for the sore throat.

Can we catch it again?	I tested positive 6/29. I got my first negative test 7/27. A whole month of COVID. I've been off of work since March 13, due to me having a baby then getting laid off in June due to the pandemic. I'm back at work as of monday, but I'm scared to catch it again. I work in a dealership and I handle a lot of clients/vehicles. People are completely disregarding the rising numbers here. I literally had a client hacking up a lung yesterday at my desk, and another one using 1 ply toilet paper as a mask. I have a 5 month old son and husband, not to mention I'd expose my parents to it too since they watch my son. I'm scared. I try to be clean but its hard when others don't even care. I was lucky to have a mild case the first time around, but I'm afraid I won't be as lucky again.	Can we catch it again? I tested positive 6/29. I got my first negative test 7/27.

Anyone have GI issues only?	I had possible COVID exposure the week of 4th of July, and started experiencing GI issues on Saturday, 7/11, about 1 week ago. My symptoms have all been somewhat mild and intermittent: stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, headaches, and fatigue. No fever, no other symptoms I’m aware of. I also suffered a concussion one month ago, which could explain some of the fatigue. The nausea is the thing that’s throwing me off though, as it feels too intense to be concussion-related but not intense enough to be food poisoning or flu. I do pass solid stools still (loose stool maybe once a day), but the nausea is bad enough to keep me up at night and doesn’t seem to be impacted by pepto. The fatigue also seems to be a little more than my concussion recovery would warrant, given how I was feeling last week. Unfortunately, tests in my state are super backed up. I took a test on Tuesday and have yet to get results. I have another test scheduled this coming Tuesday (the earliest I could book) with a place that is supposed to give results sooner.

We were all mild	I’m 23f, hubs is 24m, daughter is 3. We all had a super mild case, and I don’t think I would have ever thought I was “sick” if I didn’t know about COVID. Day 1 of my symptoms: we all went to the park. I was unusually tired after running with the dog. We went home, and I had some diarrhea and lymph overall sick-ish feelings. Day 2: no diarrhea but had a mild soar throat. Had an overall sick-like body ache. I didn’t think I was sick but rather I had a reflux flair up. The worst part of all of it was a mild headache, but I thought that was do to dehydration from reflux as well. Day 3: body aches nearly gone and only a headache and soar throat remain. Day 4: a bit of a soar throat After that I had no more symptoms and never really thought I was sick. 9 days after my first day of symptoms my husband began showing symptoms. Day 1: towards evening he felt kind of cold and body achey Day 2: he was hit really hard with the digestive stuff. He was achey, had horrendous diarrhea and abdominal cramping.

Would I be a horrible person if I went to an eye doctor for 2 infected eyes?	TL;DR I likely have a very mild case of Covid19, presumed by both doctors I've talked to about it. But now I also have infections in both of my eyes due to MRSA that has colonized and infected much of my body. To say the least it is extremely important to me to keep my eyes in good health, and leaving these infections to fester is extremely risky, but going to the doctor with Covid is extremely risky for others as well. Do you guys have any advice for this situation? Would I be a terrible person if I went to an appointment and kept it as brief as possible? &amp;#x200B; I think I have a mild case of Covid. Nothing super serious, I'm very fortunate. Its been getting slowly better over 3 weeks. Had 2 days of feeling 100% (as opposed to 85% which is my worst), but yesterday felt a bit down after overworking my body a bit. Throat felt pretty gross if I didnt down water continuously, and I was getting the usual weird unexplained bodily sensations and fatigue. At the same time, as of two nights ago, I strongly believe both of my eyes are infected.	Would I be a horrible person if I went to an eye doctor for 2 infected eyes?

"Is the ""chest pain"" in your sternum? How would you describe it?"	I have been experiencing ongoing chest pains for over 2 months at this point. They are definitely mild, and seem to go away if I get focused on something else, but pre-COVID pandemic I never experienced anything like this. Really gets on my nerves.

Any chance smoking weed could affect the results of a Covid test?	I’ve been pretty safe in terms of being precautious but I work at a school and we’re opening back up soon so I’ve had to be in the office to sort files and whatnot. We’ve also been precautious in the office but the virus isn’t doing too great in my country right now. Long story short I’m now sick. I’ve got a very sore throat, but it feels like just the start of it. I felt an itch in my throat yesterday and I thought it was in my head, but I woke up with a lot of pain and feeling a pretty intense sore throat. I’m working from home until further notice and the company is getting me tested ASAP; but I stupidly smoked a joint tonight cause I panicked a bit since I’d seen my little sister a week ago and I’m worried she may pass something on to my father, who is a heavy smoker and doesn’t have the best heart. And now I may be paranoid BECAUSE I’ve just smoked and this is a stupid question or maybe it’s a valid one, but I was wondering if anyone has any idea whatsoever?

Still cough after 44 days	I (27F) don't know if this is common but I'm very frustrated as my cough does not get any better as the days go by, and it's been 44 days!

He showed zero symptom the entire time. I've been taking vitamins everyday and eating healthy. I never had any health problem before. It's just so frustrating and I don't know when it will be over.

Am afraid that I have covid-19	I only cough but just a little, I live with 2 members (Aunt, Cousin) of my family that have it but they're quarantine in one room. I only go out to get food and I usually put hand sanitizer when I go to the stores. I hung out with my girlfriend on Wednesday and everything seem fine. I took care of my parents when they had it 3 weeks ago, now they've recovered for the most part. My mom is kinda struggling. So can anyone tell me that it could just be a normal cough rather then that awful virus?

Day 15 and still battling this dang Covid-19 My Journey So far...	**Intro:** Well today is day 15 for me and I honestly thought I would be past symptoms at this point. My wife, Mother-in-law, Father-in-law, and I caught Covid-19 at the same time. They got over their symptoms about 7 days ago. Ive been stuck with my symptoms. **Day(s) 1-6 Mild** My symptoms are pretty mild. Its almost like my allergies were kicking up. I felt a little pressure in my chest and I had a dry cough. Other than my second day I was fever free and felt like I was going to have a mild case. **Day(s) 7-10 Moderate** My cough has continued to get pretty bad, and I decided to stop taking cough medicine and moved on to cough drops. My most annoying symptoms are Nausea after eating, lack of appetite, my legs feel like jello (weakish and shaky), difficulty falling asleep, and a little bit of dizziness after laying down all night. These all kind of started around day 7 for me and just wont go away. I havent seen anyone else mention their legs feeling like mine and that coupled with just being stuck has me worried. **Day(s) 11-15 ER Visit** On Day 11 I went	Day 15 and still battling this dang Covid-19 My Journey So far... **Intro:** Well today is day 15 for me and I honestly thought I would be past symptoms at this point.

Shortness of breath &amp; dry cough since last 22 days. No fever. Doctors won't let test. Any patients(+) reported similar symptoms ? If yes, how long it took to recover ?	Never happened in life before (M34). So definitely not normal health for me. Started with itching kind of feeling near bottom of throat 22 days ago. Next day showed to doctor.

But when I try to talk 1 to 2 sentences continuously, I get dry cough and have to breathe (normally, nothing like deep breath).

For anyone who was given supplemental oxygen at home, how long did you use it?	What were/are your oxygen levels? If you're still using it, how long do you think you'll need it? Any information would be helpful and appreciated. My uncle was in the hospital for 3 days when his oxygen fell to 85%. He went from 4L to 2L of oxygen in one day and spent one night at the hospital completely without it. He was released because it was stable at 93%. They gave him some to take home because he gets winded when he coughs or walks for a bit. 36 hours later it's still at 93%. He wasn't given any meds and has that viral COVID pneumonia but fevers finally stopped and cough is mostly gone, but still has some phlegm. His other stats improved in the hospital. Could this mean he's slowly healing? He has a follow up appt on Saturday and we're anxious to find out how long he might need the oxygen since it hasn't gone up to 94% yet. Crazy how expensive oxygen is...	For anyone who was given supplemental oxygen at home, how long did you use it? What were/are your oxygen levels?

COVID Migraines?	I was tested for flu and COVID today. Flu negative and my doctor is certain that I have COVID. I have fluctuating fever, sore throat, lung pain/shortness of breath with a dry cough, etc., but the most difficult symptom to deal with has been migraines. Is anyone else experiencing this? If so, how is your doctor treating them? All my doctor can give me is Tylenol and codeine cough syrup right now and I’m desperate for relief.	COVID Migraines? I was tested for flu and COVID today.

Tested positive then negative and new symptom	So I tested positive on 08/04/2020. All I had was a sore throat at the time. Then I got almost every symptom. Over the days all my symptoms went away except for a light cough every two to three hours. I got retested on 08/29 and I tested negative. And now today my cough is back. So did I get a false negative? Or is it just from before where the symptoms pertain for months.	Tested positive then negative and new symptom So I tested positive on 08/04/2020.

Do I keep bothering my doctor for a neurologist referral or not?	"Day 76... I'm beginning to sound like someone stuck on a life raft... Anyhoo, it's been a while since my suspected Covid-19 infection somewhere in the middle of March. Since then I've been getting increasingly worrying neurological symptoms which don't seem to want to abate any time soon. My left arm doesn't seem to be communicating with my brain properly, I get pins and needles in my hands, face, soles of my feet, lips, tongue and nose. I get sharp stabbing pains just about everywhere and I regularly get a buzzing sensation in the middle of my chest and tinnitus in my ears, which, without fail, means something else will start up again (my throat may feel like it's closing up, or maybe my bottom lip goes numb, or I get a stab in my ankle, it's a crapshoot). I had an appointment with a doctor last week who said ""it's anxiety"". I've had anxiety since I was 5. I know anxiety. This isn't it. I told him. He said ""it's anxiety"".

Symptoms improving, still awaiting results	My symptoms started a little less than 2 weeks ago, they started with headaches and some fatigue. Then last Thursday October 1st I felt like I was dying. I had a fever of 100.8, body aches, chills, sore throat, post nasal drip and congestion. I slept pretty well and the next day my fever was gone and so were the headaches, body aches. Despite this I developed a cough and some chest pain, which I still have. I feel way better and only cough a few times a day but I’m scared I haven’t experienced the worst yet. Is it possible my symptoms peaked last Thursday and now I’m slowly getting better?

Shortness of breath and o2	I have been having symptoms for the past 8 days. Yesterday I felt like I wasn’t sick at all. This morning I woke up after 3 hours of sleep and was fine for a few minutes but then I felt as if I was suffocating. At first my o2 was fine (98-100) but I just couldn’t get the SOB to stop and asked my husband to drive me to the hospital. (My oxygen dipped all the way to 85 for a minute but then went back up) By the time we got there I felt better and everything stabilized. This past week I haven’t had a fever. I had GI symptoms and SOB. The SOB is the worst symptom. I am very scared. I have never been more afraid in my life. On March 2nd my daughter got very sick and had pneumonia etc negative flu and strep. I got sick shortly after as did my son. It lasted 2 or 3 weeks. I was presumed positive but now I’m not so sure. I have less symptoms now but the SOB wasn’t there this bad before. I am afraid to go anywhere and I haven’t gone anywhere for months.

Anyone had a runny nose + pressure in sinuses?	I tested negative a week ago, but I've been out a little (had a social distancing picnic with my parents and sister, went to the drugstore) and woke up this morning with a few symptoms: runny nose, sensation of burning in nostrils, stomach ache. Now, it could be anxiety or allergies, but I'm wondering if anyone who tested positive had those symptoms. I feel pretty tired now, had some soup and a granola bar and I'll be spending the day on the couch now 😩	Anyone had a runny nose + pressure in sinuses?

COVID-19 Shopping List	Hey guys! I've spent the last 5 days in close contact with someone who was just told today that she was exposed to COVID-19, and I as of last night have a headache and very low-grade fever. It could be unrelated (though seems unlikely), but I am going to assume I have COVID-19 and am trying to plan ahead. I have a friend who offered to do an errand trip for me tomorrow so, my question is: For those who have it or have had it, what would you add to a shopping list of helpful things to have in the house (aside from the obvious - food, tea, tylenol, thermometer)? What have you found you've used the most often or has been best at soothing your symptoms, etc? So far I've asked them to get a pulse ox and lozenges. Any and all suggestions welcome! Thank you!

We were exposed—what to do now?	We received word this morning that someone my SO spent time with yesterday for about 4 hours indoors has tested positive. He did not disclose to us that he was ill or had been tested. After he notified us today, he said he’s been sick for 2 weeks and got a test on Monday. I’m in a total panic because we’ve been trying our best and my SO thought he was with a trusted friend who was also doing their best. Despite our blinding anger, what can we do now? How long should we wait to get tested? Should we take supplements? Any help or recommendations are appreciated. Also, how do you deal with the stress and anxiety of waiting to see if you are sick?

Infected in March and POSITIVE FOR ANTIBODIES: Almost asymtpomatic- My Story	Hi all, I am a female in my early 20s living in Florida (a hub for the virus), and I had coronavirus in late March. I wanted to hop on here and share my story, being that I suffer from major hypochondria and anxiety and had no resources when I was infected. At the time, I was overwhelmed with anxiety and found a very disappointing lack of information for coronavirus in people of my age range- I found the media neglected to address cases in anyone besides the more at-risk population. I hope this can help those who identify with my situation. I was involuntarily exposed to the virus at my job, but never got tested for it. At the time, I basically was told to ride out the symptoms since there were no tests readily available to people my age. Today, I took the antibody test and received my results that I am IgG positive- meaning I have antibodies confirming previous existence of coronavirus in my body. This suggests slight immunity, however studies show it is unclear exactly how much. I will continue to wear masks and follow CDC guidelines.

Concerned I may have COVID?	Hello, I am in the Army and have been out in the field training for the past week. About two nights ago I started getting a pain in my right chest. Felt internal. I woke up the next morning to a dull pain every time I inhaled and shortness of breath, almost like something was sitting on my chest. I am currently about to be taken to the hospital for chest X-rays. My left lung feels fine, I don’t have a fever, I don’t feel achy, etc. I have higher blood pressure than normal but nothing scary.

Covid and smoking....	woke up yesterday with a tickle in my throat, fatigue/malaise, and a mild headache. nothing I wouldn’t have gone to work with in the past, but of course I absolutely panicked. got tested today. now I just have to wait and see if it progresses, or if it’s a little bug from too much drinking over the holiday.

Any smokers who’ve gotten the full Covid whammy, what was your experience? it’s hard to google this because most of the articles basically amount to “lol you gonna die” which is not helpful.

Did I get tested too soon?	On Sunday I went to a bbq with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while, 3 day’s later he tells me he got a positive COVID19 test and that I should get tested. He thinks he might’ve been exposed a week ago while he was coming to to his home city since the people he was staying with before were all negative. He has zero symptoms. It’s been 5 days since I saw him and 2 days since I got tested. No symptoms either.

Physician Assistant here. Covid19 positive individuals, if you took Motrin (Ibuprofen) to help with pain and fever, how did it affect you?	[Been reading a lot about avoiding Ibuprofen for covid19 treatment](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1086), however we don’t exactly have the science to back this claim up, [as explained here.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-18/theres-no-good-reason-to-avoid-ibuprofen-if-you-are-infected-with-the-coronavirus%3f_amp=true). So I want to ask those of you who have come back positive, or are likely to be positive and still waiting on testing, to share your experience. I work in pediatrics in a state that is increasingly getting worse. Little kiddos often aren’t symptomatic, but Motrin is one of the go to drugs any time they have a fever. So I am curious... Did Ibuprofen aggravate your symptoms? Did Tylenol relieve them in anyway? If possible, can you state your age group? And always, sending my love to you all who are suffering directly or indirectly. Remember to stay safe and stay home if you can.	Physician Assistant here. Covid19 positive individuals, if you took Motrin (Ibuprofen) to help with pain and fever, how did it affect you? [Been reading a lot about avoiding Ibuprofen for covid19 treatment](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1086), however we don’t exactly have the science to back this claim up, [as explained here.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-03-18/theres-no-good-reason-to-avoid-ibuprofen-if-you-are-infected-with-the-coronavirus%3f_amp=true). So I want to ask those of you who have come back positive, or are likely to be positive and still waiting on testing, to share your experience. I work in pediatrics in a state that is increasingly getting worse. Little kiddos often aren’t symptomatic, but Motrin is one of the go to drugs any time they have a fever. So I am curious...

Firsthand Experience w/ COVID19 - Mental Health	Hi everyone, New here; its so nice to find a community that freely shares experiences -- good or bad -- related to this illness. I've mentioned in a few posts that my dad is positive and currently in the ICU (extubated now, but still has O2 support). He is an essential worker, who had to continue to work despite shelter-in-place. As with most of you here, esp those who are dealing w/ critical cases in the ICU, this illness is taking a toll on my family's mental health. We are seeking family counselors / therapists via trustworthy sources, but the day-to-day is still incredibly heartbreaking. And more recently, I am really concerned seeing news in the US about certain areas lifting shelter-in-place, not only for obvious public health reasons, but also because people are trying so hard to rush back to normal (and in my head it feels like they want to gloss over all the people / families who cannot just go flip a switch and go back to normal). I understand that this doesn't replace an actual mental health counseling service. But I was wondering if any of you have strategies to share to keep your / families'	Firsthand Experience w/ COVID19 - Mental Health Hi everyone, New here; its so nice to find a community that freely shares experiences -- good or bad -- related to this illness.

85 days into recovery, Brother now may have caught the virus. Help	Hey everyone, so I’ve been on this journey for almost 90 days now and over the last week I have been feeling close to normal as I can remember, the only issue is occasional shortness of breath I’m the morning but my pulmonologist says that’s just my lungs still recovering. Now for some not so great news. My brother over the past few days has been coming down with a shortness of breath over the last few days and isolated him self into his room today. What are the chances of me getting sick again being that I haven’t 100% recovered yet?	85 days into recovery, Brother now may have caught the virus.

My dad (52) is hospitalized - what can we expect?	My dads been sick for about a week. He’s 52 and slightly overweight. This morning he was having difficulty breathing and asked my mom to take him in. My mom got ahold of the nurse and they said his oxygen was at 82, but they’ve gotten it up to 97 now. He got tested on Thursday but hasn’t gotten his results back, so they gave him another test in the hospital. Once they get these swab test results back, he’ll be moved to the covid unit. They think he has it because an antibody test came out positive. My moms freaking out. He’s had pneumonia 3 times before and the nurses told my mom he has pneumonia now, again. Anyone else been through this? They obviously aren’t allowing visitors, and my dad has only texted my mom once which I don’t really get. Yesterday he was in bed all day but he’d have enough energy to text. Just looking for some calm from others who have been through this. How long should we expect him to be in the hospital? Will they call us if they have to intubate him? Should we call and check on him again? Update: 07/21	My dad (52) is hospitalized - what can we expect? My dads been sick for about a week.

He seems to be doing fine too. However since the past 2 days, been having stomach upsets. This is new for me and hence wanted inputs on anyone else having similar symptoms or seen similar behavior.

Has anyone tested negative for antibodies (IgG) only to test positive later on?	Just wondering the odds of this. I know the tests aren't the best. I tested negative at Quest for IgG antibodies on Day 43. This was shocking to me at the time. But I ended up having a relapse in symptoms around Day 50, which lasted about a week. On Day 77 now with lingering chest pain my remaining concern. The rest is probably 85-90% better. I am planning to get retested as I seemingly wasn't over the disease when I went on Day 43 (if this is indeed COVID), so possibly I didn't have antibodies yet?

Still covid positive a month later	Hi! I came into contact with someone who tested positive for covid on June 11th, and I tested positive for covid on June 16th. It has been 26 days since my first positive test and I am STILL testing positive. I went on a trip with friends for the 4th of July and was in very close quarters with them, 18 days out from my first positive test. Neither of them tested positive for covid after the trip. My family is still making me isolate from them after my second positive test. How long did you guys test positive for covid? It’s definitely more than 14 days for me... I’m extremely frustrated to be treated like a leper in my own house, as it seems a positive covid test almost a month out didn’t spread it to people I was with. I’ll stay in my room for the comfort of my family, but i’m losing my mind and cannot do another two weeks if I test positive again.	Still covid positive a month later Hi!

Do I have it again?	I had a 70+ day run of many of the classic symptoms. Following that, I was essentially better for 6 weeks, though i had some residual fatigue, weakness and memory issues and then a week ago I got the sinus pressure/nasal inflammation, itchy eyes headache, fuzzy headedness/memory issues, fatigue, loss of smell, sleep disruption, and short stint of diarrhea. Is it possible I have it again? No lung pain, chest pain, body aches, fever or racing heart rate at this point.	Do I have it again? I had a 70+ day run of many of the classic symptoms.

Has anyone experienced a lingering high temperature after the virus had run its course?	My(21F) symptoms started 7/29 and have been pretty mild, but it just seems like I can’t fully shake this virus. For the last week (~9 days) my only symptom has been a lingering high temperature and some fatigue. My temperature has ranged from 99.1 to 100.3 and fluctuates all day. I know a lot don’t consider this range to be a fever, but it’s still high and a cause of concern for me. I’m not sure if this even counts as a symptom at this point because it has been so regular which makes it hard to figure out if I’m still contagious. Has anyone experienced something similar?

Antibody tested today and something odd	After finding out there was local antibody testing available, my spouse and I went to get tested (results due in a couple of days). On the way in they do temperature testing using an oral thermometer. I had a temp of 99.2. My spouse a temp of 99.0. Okay... at home using a forehead scanning thermometer my temp is 97.8. I checked again when I got home. We feel fine. The last time I showed a temp on the forehead thermometer was early March. My husband once registered 99 in mid March. I was sick until early April and never tested. We decided to antibody test to find out if covid was what we had. The nurse asked us how we were feeling. We said totally fine. She said while elevated, it wasn’t even a temp really so it’s likely fine. I could tell she found it odd though. I’m kind of assuming her thermometer was off. What do you think?

Covid immunity	I had, luckily, a very mild case of coronavirus in late June. After a few weeks my symptoms disappeared and I tested negative. I live in one of the US states that mandates self quarantining after traveling to a hotspot state. I recently visited one for a little over 24 hours. Technically, I am supposed to quarantine again. However, I had and recovered from the virus so recently I'm wondering if quarantining again right now would just be overkill/unnecessary because I should at least have temporary antibodies or if I should just abide by the quarantine? Thoughts? What would you do?	Covid immunity I had, luckily, a very mild case of coronavirus in late June. After a few weeks my symptoms disappeared and I tested negative.

Am I overreacting?	I've been having someone stay with me the past 2 months. I've been taking this very seriously, doing social distancing, working from home, etc. The person staying with me hasn't been, thinks this is all over blown, it's just a flu, etc. They're still going to work, which is fine I get it, you need to work. However, they've been driving into work with another co-worker, and I know the smoke weed, using the same pipe etc on their way to and from work. I know they've stopped at people's house on the way home from work. This morning I woke up and they're not here, and I'm pretty sure they're out hanging out with people, and if that's the case I think I'm going to ask them to leave. They know how seriously I'm taking this, and they're just not at all, and it's starting to aggravate the hell out of me.	Am I overreacting? I've been having someone stay with me the past 2 months.

Do you know how you contracted COVID?	Just curious to those who tested positive, as I’ve seen conflicting reports on the most likely way to contract COVID. Recently I’ve seen that touching surfaces with COVID is less likely, and that face to face interactions are the largest spreader. Curious to hear if anyone knows for sure/has a good idea of how exactly they contracted the virus. Hope everyone is well!	Do you know how you contracted COVID?

Different symptoms for different family members?	Quick background, February 28th I felt generally crappy. I was 9 months pregnant chalked it up to that and went into labor the next day. All that day in the hospital felt like I had the worst flu ever but nurses swore it could be from my medication... until later. A few hours later I told my nurse I felt as if I couldn’t get air or breathe... they ignored it. Immediately after giving birth I told the nurse again that I couldn’t breathe. They also realized I had a 102 fever. The whole night resulted in horrific chills and body aches, probably the worst I’ve ever had. Along with chest tightness I developed a cough like I never had. I would wake often gasping for air coughing very hard with so much mucus I felt like I was suffocating. Again, nurses shrugged it off. Fever lasted on and off for about 5-6 days. Night was wayyyy worse! Extreme chills and extreme sweats. Chest pain, cough, waking gasping for air and coughing uncontrollably, I was afraid to sleep because I kept feeling myself stop breathing. Finally went to the hospital when my fever shot to 104. Chest X-ray was clear	Different symptoms for different family members? Quick background, February 28th I felt generally crappy.

When to go to ER	Okay, I’m on day 15 of presumed covid-19 but I *can’t* get tested because they’re only testing hospital workers and seniors here. I have had every symptom except loss of taste. I haven’t had a fever in 3 days but I’m still exhausted after every movement, my heart races when I’m sitting down, I’m coughing, my chest feels weird, and I get winded with movement. There’s no way for me to get seen by a doctor unless I call an ambulance and go to emergency. I don’t want to take up the spots of people who may be in more serious need, but I also don’t want to ignore this if it seems serious. I know no one can give medical advice, but I’m curious if this seems in line with “mild” symptoms to those who have had it and whether I should just ride it out or not.

Donating plasma as a recoveree	I tested positive on March 20th and just got my results today showing I'm negative now. I do not have either test result as they were given to me over the phone. The tests were arranged by my work since I am a firefighter/paramedic and was exposed through my work. My blood type is AB negative which makes me a universal plasma donor. Will the donation center allow me to donate to a specific local Corona patient in an ICU in super critical condition without the paperwork showing my test results? I can't get the paperwork until Monday but can donate tomorrow morning. He's coded twice and is in liver and kidney failure and obviously on a vent. Can they take my donation for him and just test it for the antibodies?	Donating plasma as a recoveree I tested positive on March 20th and just got my results today showing I'm negative now.

Why the fuck are schools still open????!!!!	My mom is an education professor and of course it’s her class she teaches that MUST go to an elementary school because her dean says “it’s an important class” while she herself stays at her fucking home while my mom and other professors for that class only have to show up in person. I told her to quit her job since our dad can still work remotely and say she’s uncomfortable but of course she says she needs her job. And it’s already stressful managing 100+ college students even without Covid but making sure they took their Covid test and not get exposed (aka not go to parties hang out with friends shop at the mall eat at restaurants go to bars) is a nightmare and is that even possible?!???! Hell fucking no. While the dean is laying around and getting frustrated every time my mom updates her about how there’s a new case amongst her students who may have infected her classmates as well as the children at the school and their parents.

The Day 30 Regression	I wanted to make a post about this because it seems common enough, and I don't see it discussed much. Probably because not many people have made it to the 30 day mark yet. Long story short, I'm 32M, no health issues, normal weight, but a lazy lifestyle. I had classic symptoms sans cough, diagnosed presumed positive starting 3/10. Mostly recovered by day 14, feeling 100% by day 18 (3/28). Fast forward to day 28(4/7). Feeling fine until just after lunch I get slapped with a tipsy drunk feeling and really heavy fatigue. It's unmistakably a sick feeling. Slight aches here and there too. I'm at work and stick it out for the rest of the day (no worries, only 2 other people in building). Afterwards the sick feeling starts fading away, then coming back strong, then fading, coming back. Almost on like a 30 minute/1 hour cycle. Day 29, feeling better upon waking up, but sleep cut short by trouble sleeping.Brush off yesterday's feelings. But then feeling sick again an hour into work. Throat feeling a bit soar with a little tickle, lungs a little heavy. By lunch feeling better again, although not much appetite.

20s overweight Female, took ivermectin	20s, F Overweight, sporadic high blood pressure (it’s been high for like a week, used to be high years ago), intermittent asthma, migraines, POTS &amp; hypokalemia I tested positive today. Symptoms started a couple of days ago, I’m not entirely sure. I had a horrible headache since Sunday but I thought it was just one of my migraines. Then realized everyone else in my household had the same headache. So far my symptoms have been mild (100.0f, headache that goes away with Tylenol, body aches, fatigue, scratchy throat and high BP). I wanted to ask 2 things: 1. Has covid been causing high BP? My blood pressure has been running on the low side this year (goes high when I’m stressed or when I have a migraine) 2. Has anyone taken ivermectin? I had a 90yo family member that was “dying” (double pneumonia, high fevers, presumed positive but never tested etc etc) and they took ivermectin and now they’re improving a lot. Before they took ivermectin, the doctors were saying he was gonna die. Now, he’s walking up and improving every day. I’m still skeptical about the drug though.	20s overweight Female, took ivermectin 20s, F Overweight, sporadic high blood pressure (it’s been high for like a week, used to be high years ago), intermittent asthma, migraines, POTS &amp; hypokalemia I tested positive today.

Day - 4	I've been feeling like I can't smell or taste anything but sometimes I get back the sensation. That's it, I have no other problems.

Showing symptoms anxiety	Hello people, I don't exactly know why but I feel like I have to share it, and maybe people could help/relate. I'm a 20 year old male. Last week, my sister started showing symptoms after being with a confirmed case. A few days later she got tested herself and came back positive. Soon enough, most of my family members also started showing symptoms. I have a background of generalized anxiety, so I started to panic. Soon enough, I started showing symptoms as well; Headaches (which I don't usually suffer from), weakness, lightheadedness, increased mucous, slightly sore throat and light dry cough. I feel almost completely well, but what's actually terrible about this is the anxiety. After reading about all the cases about how persistent this thing is, and how you can go from feeling fine to critically hospitalized within days is just terrifying to me. How you never hear of anyone experiencing only light symptoms that persist for no longer than a few days, but rather, it's always persistent, can't get out of bed - devastating, even worse than the flu. Thinking about all this makes me feel short of breath, which is in itself scary, as that is a	Showing symptoms anxiety Hello people, I don't exactly know why but I feel like I have to share it, and maybe people could help/relate.

California Fires	So I recently tested positive on the 3rd of September after having gi symptoms the week previous. I had gotten a test on the 26th of August and that one came back negative but a week later and two positive tests. Now I am recovering from the head and chest symptoms (headache, congestion, dry cough, slight shortness of breath) and have not left my room (except for a few exceptions) since then. Since the air quality has been so poor due to the fires I have been keeping my windows closed. For the most part I seem to be recovering a little bit more each day, but today especially I’ve noticed more coughing and shortness of breath. I’ve been keeping tabs on my oxygen levels with an oximeter and so far they have kept stable between 97-99. I have asthma and I find that I reach for my inhaler more often during fire season, my question here is do you guys think this slightly worsening cough/shortness of breath is due more to the air quality, more to COVID-19, or a fun mixture of the two?

Had Symptoms for Weeks but Tested Negative?	I (24 F) thought I had this back in mid-March; I had a ton of symptoms, and multiple doctors (including an ER doctor) believed I had it at the time. My symptoms were: - for the first week and a half, I had slight head congestion and chest tightness that I thought were allergies (I also have asthma and figured they were related). However, I also had this weird burning feeling around my sternum both in my chest and in my upper back. - almost immediately when week two started, I came down with a low-grade fever that kept me up one night, and then the fever came and went over the next three days. - other symptoms during week two: tired, extremely achy, bad upper and lower back pain (it hurt to even lie down), chest tightness and shortness of breath (I could barely talk and this was also worse when I was lying down), dizzy, horrible headache, nauseous As I said, I have asthma, and this felt totally different from an asthma attack - I didn’t wheeze at all; it instead felt like my chest was being squeezed in a vice and like I was breathing through a	Had Symptoms for Weeks but Tested Negative?

A well-written cautionary tale from a coworker, shared with her permission.	I got the virus June 29 from hugging a friend and speaking indoors for a very short time without masks. It seemed that that person's quarantine was impeccable and I'd also been wearing a mask everywhere and maintaining six feet distance, and only speaking with others outdoors. But that night I let down my precautions. I didn't know the friend lived with someone who worked with the public. Two days later, that person and the friend tested positive. Three days after that, on July 4, my partner and I did. This person ended up infecting 8 people before she knew she was positive. (I highly recommend Texas MedClinic--their 20-minute antigen tests which are completely covered by insurance. There is no reason to wait for a week for a test result!) I was felled by a hug and a short conversation with a responsibly quarantined person with no symptoms. The next two weeks were the sickest I've ever been, with fevers, constant coughing, chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, being unable to swallow anything solid, and feeling unable to walk across the house or stand for more than a minute or two.

I got sick around March 19th, was tested on March 21st, results came back negative. Week one symptoms: Chills pretty constant, tons of fatigue, diarrhea and cough. My night sweats would bring on nightmares and wake me up in a panic, temp and would always be around 96.5 when this would happen. Week two: similar symptoms, chills and even hallucinations at night. I went to my local doctor and she thought it was some sort of infection and prescribed me an antibiotic. End of the week I thought I was feeling better. Started getting out of bed, still felt under the weather generally speaking. Had a couple beers to relive the anxiety. Next day I felt way worse, started feeling fatigued very quickly after small feats like cleaning the litter box. My entire back tensed up and I got weird sensations around my ribs. Like tingling and hot fluid. Got results from blood work, chest x ray, stool and urine. Everything seemed to have normal levels. Week three: Still lethargic and coughing consistently.

Dull pain in left rib symptom of covid19?	So I started having some consistent pain in my left rib area on Friday August 7th, and for the most part it pretty much stayed in that area. However, it felt like it just wouldn't stop. It would happen more often when I'm sitting down and if I move around it tends to stop. It's a pain that would come every couple of minutes, and Last for only like 5 seconds but it would feel like it radiates across the center of my chest sometimes. I haven't tested positive for the virus but did take a test Friday and are currently awaiting results. Not that it really makes a difference, but the reason why I got tested wasn't because of this pain. My mom just scheduled her, my dad , brother and I to get a test a few days before just to be sure we didn't catch it. And nobody in my family is showing any symptoms. I do wonder however if my rib pain is possibly covid-related? I'm not having any other severe symptoms like dizziness or cough or anything. I'm not even having too much trouble breathing but it is a very slight rightness in my chest.	Dull pain in left rib symptom of covid19?

White spots on tonsils and/or throat?	Pending-results here, tested today. While the doc at the local clinic was evaluating me post-swab, she noticed white spots; one on my right tonsil — which is slightly inflamed — and a few small ones on my throat. Tested for Strep, came back negative. (Knew it would; whatever is going on with me doesn’t feel like strep at all.) Did any of you who’ve tested positive have white spots on your tonsils/throat?

Need advice.	So around July 12 I (20M) started getting a funny feeling in my throat and automatically assumed the worst and started to quarantine in my room until I got my results. I got tested and it came back negative so I stopped quarantining and went back to normal. As of today I still have a slight tingle in my throat but that's about it, however I am extremely worried about my parents. Around the beginning of August my Mom (55F) began to have a sore throat as-well and a mild cough. Today August 8th, I noticed my mom start to cough a lot more and had her get tested today. We do not get the results until 7-10 days. Assuming my mom has covid, what should we start doing to help her feel better.	Need advice.

Bit of a sore throat and upper back pain (lungs)	"Since about Sunday or Monday night, I have felt a slight tickle in my throat which feels to be a sore throat mostly on the left side of the throat (if that makes any sense). And all day yesterday, I have felt this soreness in my upper back. I have asthma and this pain is pretty common for me when my asthma flares up. I've had to use my inhaler more than I typically do. I'm moving out of my apartment this week and suspect that the flare up in my asthma is due to the dust from the moving. However, the sore throat is something I don't think I've experienced with allergies. Both of my calves have also been sore. Don't know if this counts as ""muscle ache"" but the soreness is there. No headaches, cough, nasal congestion, fever, fatigue, or really any other symptom. I'm super concerned... this week has just been an emotional roller coaster for me and the paranoia and anxiety from these symptoms isn't helping. Honestly, how come COVID-19 couldn't have a rash as a common symptom instead of all these interrelated symptoms with the cold, flu, and allergies? RIP flu season."

Got home from working at a bar....	Day 1-I got home after a day shift at about 4pm. Felt good all day served drinks... I suddenly felt so sick I had to strip off my clothes and get in bed closed the curtains and was getting worried. So I made a appointment to get tested the next day. Day 2- I was in such a fog I went to the wrong testing site, and was late to the appointment. Still was able to get in thankfully to all the nurses who are helping with that. I got in to my apartment where a candle had been lit all day couldn’t even smell it, then realized when I went out to smoke couldn’t even taste a cigarette or anything else. still waiting on results of the test. Day 3- had a day at home slept well then the aches started I noticed them kinda piercing me on the legs before hand and was very lethargic and didn’t wanna do anything but lay in bed even though it was a beautiful day. Still waiting on results. Hoping to get results tomorrow	Got home from working at a bar.... Day 1-I got home after a day shift at about 4pm. Felt good all day served drinks...

Does testing positive for different antibodies provide different levels of protection?	I tried to search this up so I’m sorry if it’s been asked before but I tested positive for IgG antibodies. I’m not sure which antibodies mean what or what this means for me in terms of reinfection or protection. I already went through the infection back in March (tested twice since then with both negative results.) I don’t plan on letting my guard down, but I just want to know if I can live a little less afraid.	Does testing positive for different antibodies provide different levels of protection?

The breakdown of it is: positive for n_gene, negative for s_gene and negative for ORF_1ab. On my last set of results, n_gene was the only one that was negative.

Pain/slight swelling in lymph node?	Background: I’m 19F, not known for having the best immune system (about 2 colds a year and maybe 2 stomach bugs) but otherwise generally healthy. I used to vape my freshman/some of sophomore year but I have since quit and have only hit friends occasionally in the past few months. I don’t smoke weed or cigarettes. Although I haven’t knowingly been in contact with anyone with the virus, I have been doing the majority or grocery shopping for my household and have had a few close contacts when picking up takeout. Nobody in my family has any symptoms at the moment but my mom is also still going to work every day and to the grocery store/restaurants on occasion. The past few days my throat has felt a little icky, not sore but just like I had some phlegm caught in the back. Today I woke up with pain in my neck and at first I thought I slept wrong. I then noticed it was very specifically in my right lymph node. The lymph node is not any more swollen than the left one, but they both feel maybe slightly enlarged? I don’t remember my point of reference for them.	Pain/slight swelling in lymph node?

Positive test over a month ago, released from isolation...	..yet I am still missing a majority of my sense of taste. Also still experiencing a very limited range of smell. I am so tired, and still so down about this. I caught the virus from my job. (I worked in a nursing home.) The day I was meant to start my new job in EMS, I tested positive. It was so sad and incredibly daunting working the COVID unit. I know there are people who absolutely had/have it much worse than me, but I still feel so crappy. Emotionally and physically. I still feel...off. I am healthy, mid twenties and was quite active before I became infected. The virus had hit me quite hard. I just want to feel somewhat normal again. When did you feel like you were mostly back to normal?	Positive test over a month ago, released from isolation... ..yet I am still missing a majority of my sense of taste.

New symptoms after 14 days ?	I am an RN who first had symptoms 3/30. They were mild enough to ignore but after a few days i developed diarrhea. / lose of taste &amp; smell. Work tested me and i cam back + on 4/3. My main symptoms were GI, fatigue, occasional shortness of breath. Never had a fever. I would categorize my case as mild and despite having asthma and OSA, my lungs felt much better than expected... until last night. My quarantine is finished and I’m past the 14 days of first symptoms but last night i started having chest tightness that is worse than before. It is slightly relieved w my albuterol and my pulse ox is 98%. I’m just very worried bc this seems late in the game to be feeling this way. I was thinking i could have pneumonia but there’s no fevers..Anyone else experience this?	New symptoms after 14 days ? I am an RN who first had symptoms 3/30.

Would I have covid 19?	- On Thursday I started losing a lot of strength in the gym. - On Saturday I started feeling sick, a dry cough, a full nose, very low energy, quickly tired while talking up stairs and in the city, lots of climbing. - On Sunday I felt a bit better. - On Monday today, I feel just tired/lethargic and no full nose, although I did wake up with a painful throat. - I can still smell and I don't have any high temperature, fever. I'm in Portugal and awaiting for a call back from a doctor by their government hotline since Saturday. - I don't feel really sick, just very very tired the entire day. I'm 33 years old.

Prepare me for this rollercoaster of a virus	My gf (24) years old started experiencing slight chest pains and a dry cough. She went to get tested and what do you know, positive 3 days later. Also I was also feeling a sore throat but didn’t think anything of it. NOW... as far as my symptoms go; really sore throat day 1, got better on day 2, day 3 (which is today) slight dry cough and very light sore throat. My gf; bad chest pains first day, slightly better throughout day 2 and 3, cough is still there but not getting worst, and we’ll see what she feels like tomorrow. What were your experiences with this virus. Will it get worst before it gets better? Or will it be gone by the next few days.

When to leave isolation?	"I am in a country where testing isn't available, so please delete if this doesn't belong here. However, I have been ill and isolating for 10 days. On about day 6, I was ill like I've never been in my life. I had fever and chills that you could almost time, starting with my headache worsening then sweating profusely then chills--all lasting about a minute followed by a minute of rest; repeat. This was interspersed with nausea and vomiting throughout the evening. Now I am just tired with the occasional headache throughout the day. BUT the thing is that throughout all this, my highest axillary (armpit) temp was 37.4 which depending on the source is not a fever. But at that temp I was feeling awful. The last few days I start the day at 36.7 and climb to 37.1 in evening, and I don't feel great. I never took my temp before this, so I don't know what my ""normal"" baseline is. So I'm not sure when to leave isolation. I imagine I will still feel tired for some time even after I'm better, so I don't really have much of a gauge of whether I'm improving.

Possible false negative?	My brother tested positive on Wednesday. He had been showing symptoms since Monday. On Sunday, him and I watched a movie together in the same room and we shared food and drinks. I got tested the day he tested positive, and I just got my results - negative. What are the odds this is a false negative? Prior to about Tuesday, I was with him everyday, no masks, within 6 feet for hours at a time. The only symptoms I have are a headache and fatigue. My mother also tested negative, which we were tested by the same nurse at the same time. She tested us with a nasal swab, both nostrils for only 5 seconds and told us that they’ve learned they don’t need to go as deep anymore. My mother is also coughing and has a sore throat. My dad was tested through a different clinic, which they did both nostrils for 15 seconds each and he’s still awaiting results, and I’m almost wondering if his will come back positive as it was done correctly. I find it hard to believe we’re all negative after being around my brother two days before he tests positive. What are your	Possible false negative? My brother tested positive on Wednesday.

Covid 19 Mild Case?	I’m a 22 year old healthy male. I recently returned from a short break away and that night I started to feel a bit nauseous and fatigue. The next day I woke up feeling terrible. I had a slight fever, had the chills and sweats and a headache, I stayed in bed all day not feeling the eagerness to eat, all I consumed was mainly water and some paracetamol. I have now woken up this morning seemingly feeling better than the previous days and all that I am feeling is a slight sore throat. I am unable to get a covid test as I’m in the UK and all of the testing sites are a mess and all full up. I was wondering if anyone has experienced these symptoms similar to me and how they progressed over the next days? I’m just curious to know whether these symptoms could return by tomorrow.

What was your vitamin d level before you caught covid and how bad did it hit you?	I have seen studies linking vitamin d with Covid severity. Wondering what you guys experienced? My vitamin d level was 13.5 ng/ mL about 6 weeks before covid. This is very low. Illness hit me hard and the effects have been going for three months now although improving. Anyone else know their levels?	What was your vitamin d level before you caught covid and how bad did it hit you? I have seen studies linking vitamin d with Covid severity.

What medications/supplements do you recommend?	Hi! I have vitamin D3, C, and Zinc/Copper. I don't take them daily because I take a red raspberry leaf suppliment and a burdock root supplement for hormone balance and detoxifying my blood so those take up most my day as I have to take them a few times between a few hours. I plan to get Shatavari to help with the immune system too, as well. I'm not sick with covid, but wanted to know what meds and supplements would be best in case the dreaded day ever came. I'm 24F, 5'5 and 185, so....overweight lol. I'm afraid to get this because I just don't know how my body would react. I also have terrible anxiety and SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) once in a blue moon. Do over the counter flu meds help? Any other suppliments I'm missing?

Does this sound like a Covid symptom?	About 24 hours ago, I felt the sensation that something was in the back of my throat. I would describe it as the sensation of a pill being stuck in there. I do not have Tonsils, and I have no other issues. I feel completely fine other than that one pill feeling, it doesn't hurt, it's not scratchy, I have no cough or phlegm, just the assumed swollen lymph node or something. I am receiving a test on Friday that is mandatory for all students at my institution. Is this an early sign? Could it just be globus pharyngeus? I have both extreme anxiety and Acid Reflux throughout the week, so it's tough to discern. Wish me luck, and I look forward to hearing what y'all have to say!	Does this sound like a Covid symptom?

Positively thought I had COVID but tested negative twice...	So 5 days ago I woke up with no sense of taste or smell, a slight head ache and a mild sore throat the previous couple of days I felt super tired even after a full nights rest. I went to an urgent care to take a rapid test and was pretty confident that it was going to be positive but to my surprise it was negative. I made an appointment to speak with my doctor and told him about it, he predicted 60/40 percent chance that it was a false negative and I actually had COVID. I had to wait to schedule a test, and over the next few days I felt completely exhausted and my brain felt like it was in a fog still accompanied by lack of taste/smell, random headaches and sore throat. Finally got in to take my test and got the results yesterday- negative again. Today, I can smell and taste a little but not 100%, I feel like my throat is more sore, now my arms feel weird. I don’t even know how to describe it, like a tingling/burning sensation up and down them and my neck. My face feels hot but I have	Positively thought I had COVID but tested negative twice...

Is it a cold or covid 19?	Boyfriend started having a congested nose, sniffles, fatigue and little bit of chills on Friday. Same symptoms on Saturday. Today he’s just feeling slightly tired and chills. No sniffles or congested nose anymore. He never had a fever either. For me, I got a little phlegm in my throat yesterday and today. Both times only lasted an hour with coughs trying to get it out. But the rest of the day I was fine. My throat hurts a little today from trying to cough out the phlegm (more today than yesterday). No fever. We went grocery shopping on Sunday evening (not busy at the store). Haven’t gone out since then. We wore masks, washed our hands, and disinfected our groceries. We’ve also been really good about social distancing. Covid, cold, or allergies?	Is it a cold or covid 19?

Yo-yo Covid Symptoms. When are you no longer contagious.	So I think I was exposed the weekend on June 20 and first experienced symptoms on the 23. I tested positive on the 27th. I had pretty mild symptoms: loss of scent and taste, headache, fatigue and body aches. Most of my symptoms went away except for the scent and taste by day 14. As of today it’s almost been a month since since I first experienced symptoms and my body aches, headaches and fatigue has returned. Is it common for symptoms to return? When will I regain my sense of smell and taste? Am I still contagious. I took another test and pending results. If it’s positive do I still quarantine? I thought I was fine since I was 3 days without fever and other symptoms so I have been out but now that I’m feeling this way again I feel I should quarantine. There isn’t much information and it is very confusing.	Yo-yo Covid Symptoms. When are you no longer contagious.

Every time I take a walk and come back home I get a horrible headache, muscle pains, back pains and feel unwell. Why is physical activity making me feel worse?	Symptoms started a month ago. Back pains, a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath etc. Fever and cough is gone so I've started talking walks in the sun and when I get home I feel so much worse. It's like all my symptoms come back with a vengeance with horrible to touch headaches, muscle pains, back pains and feel very unwell. Does anyone else get this? What is the explanation to this?

When did people get their sense of smell back?	So I have most definitely had this, my mother has a confirmed test and we have been in the same household and I had all the symptoms. I lost my sense of smell during my symptoms, it was about 5 days into feeling bad, I’m recovered now, still a bit less lung capacity and run down, but my sense of smell seems completely gone? I’m on day 20 ish now and it’s not coming back I’m starting to freak out.	When did people get their sense of smell back?

Just tested positive with no symptoms yet	I am still somewhat in disbelief after receiving the PCR results yesterday night which find me positive to Covid. My wife and two kids (1yo and 4yo) are all negative. Cant even fathom how is that possible, considering I haven't been exposed to people to which my wife hasn't been. We have been relatively cautious with social distancing, wearing masks and maintaining stricter hygiene, hanging out exclusively with our inner family (parents and siblings) who we shared a house with until recently. None of them is showing any symptoms as of right now. I have been doing grocery shopping for the family almost exclusively for the last few months, so I am suspecting maybe I got exposed that way... When I got the news, I was almost certain that it has to be some sort of a mistake, but after reading about the likelihood of a false positive, I am starting to slowly swallow the hard pill. I did not sleep well last night, mostly because of anxiety and bad dreams/thoughts around analyzing the possible exposure and outcome, so I am feeling pretty tired and having less energy than usual.

"I'm building a ""Covid-19 Box."" What else should I add?"	My family hasn't yet contracted Covid (that we know of). I've been slowly buying and stashing away products to help us fight the disease and make it a little easier on us. So far I've added the following products: Powdered chicken bone broth packets Chamomile tea DayQuil/NyQuil Severe Mucinex FastMax/Nightshift Severe Cold and Flu Pepto-Bismol Emergen-C Immune Plus Liquid ionic zinc Melatonin I'm thinking of adding a bottle of D3 5000IU. We have Tylenol on hand. We have some quercetin. Maybe I can add a bunch of paper plates, foam cups, and other disposable dinnerware to cut down on dishes. Canned/powdered soup. What else should I add that I haven't mentioned? I need ideas for easy meal prep that doesn't involve a lot of cleanup. Also, another thing. Both our washer and dryer are not working, and we've been taking our laundry to the laundromat for a while. If/when we get sick, I'm not sure how we will do laundry, or if it will be safe to ask someone to do it for us. Any suggestions? Thanks.	"I'm building a ""Covid-19 Box."" What else should I add?

Covid positive kids	Does anyone have a little one who tested positive? Both myself and one of my daughters (3) tested positive just over 2 weeks ago. My symptoms haven’t been *too* bad, feel like I’ve got the flu and I *think* I’m out of the worst of it now, despite still feeling pretty lousy. My daughter on the other hand hadn’t got as lucky and really suffered and still is. She’s slightly better than she was (she was worryingly sick for a while) but still seems to have a long way to go. She’s moving around a lot more and eating more than she was which is good. But her symptoms are all still not much better. Was just hoping others could share any experiences with their kids? To give me some hope? It’s breaking my heart and there’s nothing I can do.	Covid positive kids Does anyone have a little one who tested positive?

Immune system weakened?	After covid 19 do you think people's immune systems will be weakened because social distancing and always using hand sanitizer etc. Lack of continuing to build up immune system because of these precautions. I'm asking either if you had it or didn't. Sorry I don't know how to ask this right.	Immune system weakened?

Intermittent and random skin rashes/hives as a symptom of Covid?	So over the past week I’ve had a few weird rashes pop up and disappear. First I had a small patch on my bicep that resembled hives and was kinda itchy about a week ago. A couple of nights ago, I had a slightly larger red rash on my wrist that was completely flat this time, but still itchy. And tonight I’ve noticed a red patch on one of my toes that is probably itchier than the rest and is slightly raised. I have no other symptoms at all. It’s not unlikely that I’ve been exposed to covid either; I’ve been back to my home city (from university) for a large portion of summer and upon returning to my university city, have moved into a house share with other working professionals.

Can your sickness get worse by being near someone else with covid?

Symptoms changing	I started with chills and possibly a fever but no way of confirming without a thermometer. Then a sore throat developed later on that day. After a couple days the chills went away and I thought the sore throat was ready to leave. Woke up the next day and the sore throat became worse and painful. Then came the headaches. Tension headaches possibly sinus headaches. Pretty much sometimes when I breathe through my nose I get a pulsating headache that I just can not handle. It is now Day 7 and the only symptom that remains is the headache triggered by breathing through my nose.

After a couple days the chills went away and I thought the sore throat was ready to leave. Woke up the next day and the sore throat became worse and painful. Then came the headaches. Tension headaches possibly sinus headaches. Pretty much sometimes when I breathe through my nose I get a pulsating headache that I just can not handle. It is now Day 7 and the only symptom that remains is the headache triggered by breathing through my nose.	2

Husband is NYPD	I figured my family would end up here. I just wanted to give a little background. My husband and I are both technically germaphobes. Reasons are because our youngest is an asthmatic and a tiny cold lands her in the hospital at least 2x a year. We’ve had 2 scary episodes, so we always had extra Lysol, hand sanitizer, and masks in the house. When someone was sick, they were automatically quarantined. But, with COVID, hubs being a Cop, and a mayor that doesn’t care about PO’s, I knew this would hit home sooner. I am posting this because reading your symptoms. Your remedies. Has truly helped me sleep at night. So, I’d like to do my part. 3 out of 6 of my husbands team is positive. Patient zero tried his best not to infect his brothers. 4/2 Once his nephew tested positive, he tried to call out but they gave him a hard no. He went to work. Wore a mask. And didn’t come into contact with anyone physically. As soon as he had the first symptom 4/8, he called out. Symptom was a headache.

What vitamins for post covid fatigue?	Does anyone know what vitamins are good to take for post covid fatigue and confusion? Well, maybe not confusion. My sister got over it a month ago but she is still dealing with exhaustion and she says she can't focus her attention on anything for very long. She says concentrating on anything is exhausting, but her college classes are starting back up soon. Anything she can take that might help and won't hurt? Right now she just takes a multivitamin daily, nothing else...	What vitamins for post covid fatigue? Does anyone know what vitamins are good to take for post covid fatigue and confusion?

Violent coughing in the morning	Most of my coughing comes in the morning - it’s usually pretty violent (sometimes with dry heaves) - it’s congested, but very hard to bring anything up. I usually end up spitting for a couple hours. This morning I had warm water with lemon, and that seemed to help make it a bit more productive - does anyone else use other methods? I have an inhaler but I’m reticent to use it because the steroids seem to make my other problems worse (anxiety, shakes, etc.)	Violent coughing in the morning Most of my coughing comes in the morning - it’s usually pretty violent (sometimes with dry heaves) - it’s congested, but very hard to bring anything up.

Heart Rate Has Decreased Considerably?	I'm on day 16 of having covid, and overall, it's been mild. No real cough, no fever, though I did lose all smell/taste, get a sore throat, sore body and had a few days of diarrhea, but that's about it. Starting about day 14, the fatigue has ramped up considerably. Before while I was sick, I was able to clean my apartment and organize, and it really wasn't too bad, but now I'm crippled by the exhaustion. I use an Oura, a ring used to track sleep and more. For months, my resting heart rate during sleep is around 63 bpm. When initially I got sick, the first few days it went up to 70+ for a few nights. Now, for the past few days it's dropped to 48 bpm, and my body temperature is actually lower than my usual average by .8 degrees celsius. I'm really curious about the decreased heart rate and what it could mean? I can't find much about it anywhere.	Heart Rate Has Decreased Considerably?

Altitude/Travel Issues or Something Else?	I’ve been up in the Rocky Mountains for the past two weeks and noticed shortness of breath immediately on arrival, altitude induced I imagine. Concurrent with this trip, I started a round of antibiotics for tooth issue and ever since traveling and starting antibiotics, I’ve had on and off diarrhea (which is labeled as a symptom of the meds fwiw) The SOB is more like the need to take a deep breath (which I can no problem) every 10 min or so. But I feel like I only notice it when I’m thinking about it; 3 mile hike w/ a toddler in the carrier, no problem. No fever, cough, fatigue or sore throat. But the more I focus on SOB(?) the more I (think) feel light pressure in my chest. Am I working myself up over nothing, or do others seem similarities? Heading back to my much lower altitude hometown tomorrow, but it’s difficult to get tested there at the moment. 33M non-smoker.	Altitude/Travel Issues or Something Else?

Loss of taste and smell	[removed]	Loss of taste and smell [removed]	0
Just got tested this morning and my results back a few hours later, and honestly this sucks.	Venting really. I hate not being able to taste anything I eat, or smell anything at all (hygiene is huge to me so I’ve found I just keep brushing my teeth and re-applying deodorant). I’m literally in so much pain. My lower back hurts terribly, so does my stomach/abdominal muscles, and it literally feels like my legs are falling off. Sniffling and having difficulty getting full breaths. Fevers and chills, constantly being an uncomfortable temperature. My bf has it too and we are quarantining together, he doesn’t have it bad at all. I’m just laying on the couch with ice packs all over my body for pain, under two blankets. Just took 800mg of ibuprofen for the pain as well. This is absolutely awful. TL;DR: I’m just whining but I haven’t been sick in years and this is worse than anything I’ve ever had before and I almost died of pneumonia once so bad it permanently scarred my lungs.

Does this sound like a wave of symptoms and after-affects of covid?	Anyone else’s think these symptoms sound somewhat like covid? Starting around January-March I had some weird symptoms that lasted until August. I got over a his illness where I was lightheaded, having heart palpitations, and word fevers and chills that would exclusively happen at night. I slowly recovered to where the heart, lightheaded, and fever was completely gone by about May. The chills and fevers disappeared like 5 days later. But then I started dealing with this feeling with a lump on my throat and trouble swallowing that lasted until August. Was this some huge bout with covid or something based off this? I am 99% positive all this stuff slow connected to that illness I had earlier in the year.

"I am just wondering if anyone has experienced a loss in taste BUT can taste ""salt"" and ""sweet"" vaguely in the back of their tongue? So not really a flavour per se.

Refused entry because I’m honest	Still regretting the decision to get tested in the first place. My kids were sick and daycare told me they had to stay home until we had a negative test so I thought if they have it, I have it, and I got tested, hoping to get them back in daycare so I could work. I was surprised to find out I was positive and had to tell everyone I was around, including work, that I was positive and had to quarantine for 14 days. But all the while I’m still working from home with my kids that are normally in daycare and I’m getting stressed out and depressed. I have been released by the health dept to return to work, have a letter to prove it, so today when I tried to get my kids’ lab work done for a dr appt they have next week, they ask if anyone has had covid. I said yes, me, but I have my letter I can show you. Nope - wouldn’t let me in, wouldn’t let them get labs done. They said I could enter 21 days after my positive result or get a negative.

Rapid Pruney Fingers	Hello All, I have been dealing with symptoms of COVID-19 now for just over 2 weeks. One strange symptom that occurs is how much more rapidly my fingers prune in the shower. By the time my 10 minutes of showering is over my hands appear as though I've been submerged in water for greater than 45 minutes. Definitely a new feeling for me. I know Pruney Fingers are a sign of the nervous system doing it's job. But now I'm concerned I may have a new neurological issue developing. Anyone else have the same experience? Thank you.

My house mate tested positive about 10 days ago. I got tested after finding out and I was negative. I disinfected the whole house and was put on orders to quarantine for two weeks, (we are military) and he was put in a hotel. Yesterday they sent him home after about 10 days at the hotel, because apparently his light cough had only gotten better and he was “No longer contagious”. I’m extremely suspicious about that and wondering if I should still disinfect everything he touches/ limit contact. I pretty much have my room and bathroom to myself.

Asymptomatic except for rash?	Hi everyone, Sorry if this sounds crazy, but my toddler had a weird spell of fevers in the middle of May. She would start getting warm around dinner, shoot up to 102 in the middle of the night, and then be fine by morning. The fever was very responsive to Tylenol, and lasted for 3-4 days. No other symptoms, and her doctor said not to test her for covid because she was so young and tests were hard to get. Normally we would just assume a minor cold, but she hadn’t seen anyone outside the family in six weeks. So we were worried that maybe one of us was asymptomatic and gave it to her. We’ve been mostly quarantined, but my husband has gone grocery shopping and to the pharmacy, wearing a mask. Nobody else developed symptoms, although I (35F) had really bad allergies at the time(and I almost never have allergies). So we just assumed that it was some weird toddler fluke. But now, five weeks later, I’ve developed rashes in multiple places on my torso. It started 4-5 days ago with large itchy red welts on my ribs, and now I have a patch the size of my	Asymptomatic except for rash?

Resurgence after initially beating it?	I (25 M) had tested positive for coronavirus about a month ago. My initial symptoms were fever, headache, and mostly extreme fatigue. I had no respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing or breathing issues. Overall I’d say my entire experience was a 3/10 in terms of severity. Enough to keep me in bed and resting, but nothing that caused me great worry or concern for my wellbeing. It’s been about 2 weeks since I’ve felt better but since then I’ve noticed my sense of smell is completely gone and I’ve just been hit with another bout of fatigue and mental fog. It also feels like there’s a “hollowness” in my nasal region. Has anyone else had similar experiences? I’m looking to get another test and I’m not even sure I’m contagious at this point. The health department cleared me from quarantine weeks ago and I’m currently staying with my parents. (Mid-50’s) and neither of them have caught it from me. I guess I’m mostly feeling perplexed by this virus—but perhaps that’s the nature of having an illness that’s still very far from being fully understood.	Resurgence after initially beating it?

Burning sensation in the nose	I’ll preface this by explaining I’ve been sick since March 8th. Since that day, one of the symptoms is a burning sensation in the back of nose, accompanied by loss of smell. Not completely, but almost. I still have my taste intact. Have anybody else experienced the burning feeling? I keep reading about loss of smells but nothing about a burning feeling. My journey has been very long (8 weeks!) but right now I think all my symptoms are gone except for that one and a new developed cough. Its worth noted I never had a severe cough before, not even when my chest X Ray showed covid19-like pneumonia (tested negative that day. At my ER, false negative rate of tests is 20% if sample is taken accurately.

I would do chemo all,over again instead of this. And I think my case was mild. Some commonalities were the loss of smell/taste, nausea when eating, intense pain when breathing, horrific coughing so bad I sprained some ribs and back muscles, eyes looked like I had used red lipstick for eyeliner, GI problems, headache, low fever, had a seizure, but hey, it only lasted 7 days. I only felt like I could be dying on the third day, but the nearest hospital is an hour away. I am not as fatigued as before but this thing going on with my hands and feet is crazy. Raynauds as I understand is some kind of autoimmune dysfunction involving the vascular system. The body’s extremities over react to cold temps, like holding a cold drink or handling frozen foods, walking through snow, and turn dark purple and hurt like hell. If the temps in my house go below 74 degrees, my hands and feet first tingle, go numb and turn dark	Became ill in January, now I have Raynauds Syndrome symptoms 67F who has Lupus, RA, in cancer remission, survived Mono, Hong Kong flu, kidney failure when I was 8, but this thing, this virus is not like anything I have gone through.

Positive for Covid but negative for antibodies?	I posted before about about my husband testing positive and me being a presumed positive about a month ago. I was able to get antibody testing and it came back negative. Is that possible that I actually never had the virus even though I was directly exposed and had more symptoms than my husband? Or can you get the virus and not make antibodies?	Positive for Covid but negative for antibodies?

I'm at a crossroads and both ways are shit. We dont have covid but I'm greatly concerned we will in the near future. Fear has taken over.	My wife is a grade 1 teacher and school is opening back to near normal conditions come start of new school year. The only thing they are doing is spacing the kids in her small classroom and giving her PPE. Other provinces have alternating days in school for older grades and mandatory masks for grade 4 and above but here we have a pat in the back and goodluck. I'm a diabetic type 2, overweight, hypertension and 35. I've lost 20 lbs in past 2 months but won't be ready for the start of the school year to be more healthy to a point where I'm not as worried. At least I'm young I keep reminding myself. My wife loves being a teacher and we moved across the country for her to be one. Now were in covid times, and I said we have 2 choices from my perspective: Take a year off school and I continue to work from home and she watch the kids. Least risk of catching this. 2nd option if she doesnt want to take unpaid leave is I leave and stay at an Airbnb for several months to gage how reentry of school year goes.

Since Wednesday I have a had a persistent dry/unproductive cough. Anyone testing + only have this as a symptom in the first 3-4 days?	My throat is becoming raw feeling due to it. The only known pre-existing medical condition I have is PCOS (so, hormonal). I am slightly overweight. There's some correlation between developing PCOS and developing diabetes, the latter of which is a known risk factor for COVID. I am not sure if this warrants a test. I will see a doctor tomorrow or Monday, though. I can't explain it but I do feel a weird and subtle drip like sensation deeper in my throat maybe to the top of my chest when I inhale. I am pretty worried, even if it isn't COVID, it is concerning. Also, I live in the USA's current hotspot: New York City.	Since Wednesday I have a had a persistent dry/unproductive cough.

Wife Tested Positive, I tested Negative - No isolation	Anybody else out there who’s spouse/significant other tested positive, and because you were already exposed, decided to not isolate from each other and then test negative yourself? She tested positive on a Sunday, I got my test on a Wednesday (nasal swab) and found out 2 days later that I was negative. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense to me; we kissed, shared drinks, shared air for 3 days... how do I not have it? Her symptoms are very mild; fever for only 24 hours and headaches.

Did anyone here have COVID symptom in late December/early January?	December 12th I went on a vacation to Mexico with my family, returning on the 23rd. When I landed, I noticed that I had a slight dry cough. I get bronchitis every. Single. Year. So, when I had a lingering cough that lasted for 3 weeks, I thought NBD this is just business as usual. (Usually I will get a cough that lasts about a month that is quite severe. I can’t lay down and sleep, etc). I started my job January 6th, drugged up on the strongest cough suppressants I could get, because who wants to be the person hacking up a lung... especially your first week! Eventually, my cough which started December 23rd started to go away and I had about 2 days of easy livin’. I had no other symptoms other than normally scheduled winter cough. Then, January 12th and 13th happened. January 12th started out fine, but by the evening, I had started to feel under the weather. I had no cough at this point, but I had a head ache and just generally felt off. At 11 pm, my fever was around 99F. January 13th comes along.

My COVID 19 story.	My father got sick at home first around the 6/23. My mother then began to complain about a loss of smell and taste. My father went to the hospital 2 days later. Then my mother and I began to have headaches and loss of smell and taste/diarrhea on 6/26. My brother on the other hand, had no symptoms at all which was crazy!!!Father came back 4 days later and was positive for COVID 19. On 7/2 my mother and I both felt better. My brother began to feel like shit and cough a lot/trouble breathing. We decided to get tested. Mom and brothers results came back positive while I awaited mine. Crazy part is that on 7/10 I decided to workout then I began to feel like shit after. I felt muscle aches and felt really hot. My temp was 101. Fast forward to today. I got my results from testing and I am Negative for the swab and negative for IGM and IGG. I feel really great. My temp is at 98.3 currently. Pulse Oximeter is at 98%-99%.

I’m confused and scared	Dear all, ever since i joined this sub there has been a lot going through my mind with this disease and the people that make it through. Let me start off by saying that I haven’t tested positive as of yet, i am 20 years old, and am in a fairly healthy lifestyle. However, I keep seeing more and more posts of people saying how they feel like they haven’t recovered from this virus months after they got it and that really freaks me out. I’ve only gotten sick to the point of being bedridden two or three times in my life so far yet I am a serious hypochondriac. I know at least 5 people that got this virus and all of them came out totally fine without these crazy post viral symptoms, so that leaves me scared and confused. I try to always put things into perspective and think that there has been over 15 million recoveries but I can’t help but feel anxious about this. Sorry for the format and thanks for hearing me out. Hope that whoever has this virus beats the shit out of it.

Thought I was done with this all but here we are.... Possible re-infection or just another wave?	"Haven't posted too much but have been checking up on everything here pretty frequently. Apologies for the long post my anxiety is at an all time high right now and just need some support. Back in mid march I got sick. Had all the classic symptoms (fever, chest/lung issues, short of breath, rash, loss of taste/smell, GI issues + many more). While I live in Brooklyn - at the time NYC was only testing high risk people and people exposed to a confirmed positive case and I was not able to get a test anywhere because I did not meet those requirements. My dr told me that I was presumed positive and to stay quarantined in my room away from my sister and pets until the fever and all symptoms went away. I did exactly that. Despite quarantining and taking all precautions my sister caught it a week later and had all the same symptoms minus the loss of taste and smell. We both had ""mild"" cases, mine was a little worse than hers, and we both seemed to feel almost 80% back to normal after two weeks.

How quickly did loss of smell/taste happen for you?	For the past two days, I have been showing cold/allergy symptoms and keep telling myself “it’s just a cold” (still hanging out at home and not going anywhere I should add). I have had sneezing fits throughout the weekend, runny nose, stuffiness, sinus congestion, raw/scratchy throat, mild fevers (highest 101.1 briefly). Well, I finally took some decongestant nasal spray to clear up my nasal passages and it definitely helped, but within minutes, my smell was just...gone!! I checked a very fragrant candle and just...nothing! How quickly did loss of smell/taste happen for those of you dealing with this symptom? I guess I should go get tested in the morning, but just wanted to hear other’s experience with this! Thanks!	How quickly did loss of smell/taste happen for you?

Dubious greetings to this group	Hey there everyone. I'm presently quarantined in a hotel room after having tested positive last Sunday (08.23). My test was required prior to a scheduled colonoscopy. Given my heavy vigilance since late February, I was a bit freaked out when I got the call about my test results. I'm fortunate to be in a smaller town where the county is proactive with testing - and there's available resources for cases like mine, where I wasn't able to self-isolate at home. I'm considered asymptomatic. The local med experts think (due to incubation times) I was likely infected even several days before testing positive. Here in this hotel room, I'm monitoring my temps with a digital thermometer I was given. My highest temp has been 98.5. I have no cough, stomach probs, loss of smell/taste. The only thing of note is the morning after my positive test, I woke up in my hotel bed \*drenched\* with sweat. Ever since then, I've been sleeping a lot more, but no more sweats. If not for the positive test, the sweats and a sense of unusual fatigue for a few days, I'd never think anything was wrong.

My oxygen levels also dip when I walk slowly so I’m not sure what’s going on. Dr ordered chest X-ray it’s clear so they are doing more tests like a CT scan Blood work and EKG in the ER per my DR since it’s quicker than ordering them in.

My Father is Covid-19 positive	Hi guys! I’m looking for some advice here. My father contracted Covid-19 at his workplace, and myself, my mom, and my brother have been living with him and in close contact with him for a couple weeks, even while we were waiting for his pending Covid-19 results to come back, and still after the results came back positive. We got tested at CVS minute clinic, and the three of us came back negative. Both my mom and I have been experiencing symptoms from a low grade fever, to a persistent headache, runny nose, and loss of appetite. I’m a little concerned that it was a false negative, especially on my end because I’ve been feeling disoriented, I had a fever for one night, and if I eat warm food I develop a fever (101°), and I’ve had a headache for 10 days now, and I wake up with either a stuffed or runny nose. I’d be elated if it wasn’t a false negative, but I’m still concerned because it’s such a contagious virus, I was in close contact with my dad, and I’ve been feeling at least not at my normal health baseline for 10 days now.

Crashed Overnight	"Hi, So about a month ago my boss at Zaxby's suddenly became ill. He was at work basically just fallen over sick. Of course with everything going on we sent him home, but the owner found no reason to shut down or do any necessary extra cleaning. FYI Zaxby's is franchised based so any complaints or concerns to their so called ""corporate"" does absolutely nothing. Anyway about less than two weeks goes by and my boss returns. He talks of his symptoms: fatigue, stomach pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell. Basically many symptoms that were COVID related. There was a positive test result at another store that is owned by the same guy and they didn't do anything either. So fast forward a few days from my boss returning and now he has told me that his covid test came back positive. I then proceed to ask him what kind of measures the store is going to take. He proceeded to tell me that HR guy felt no need to take any measures because he didn't work two days before showing symotoms and was not near anyone when he did.

Of course with everything going on we sent him home, but the owner found no reason to shut down or do any necessary extra cleaning. FYI Zaxby's is franchised based so any complaints or concerns to their so called ""corporate"" does absolutely nothing. Anyway about less than two weeks goes by and my boss returns. He talks of his symptoms: fatigue, stomach pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell. Basically many symptoms that were COVID related. There was a positive test result at another store that is owned by the same guy and they didn't do anything either. So fast forward a few days from my boss returning and now he has told me that his covid test came back positive. I then proceed to ask him what kind of measures the store is going to take. He proceeded to tell me that HR guy felt no need to take any measures because he didn't work two days before showing symotoms and was not near anyone when he did. Now fast forward to the next day,"	1

Recovered...6 Weeks later	"So, I tested positive the end of March and was down for two weeks. The County Health Department ""cleared"" me after 3 days being symptom free. They told me I'd feel a few effects long term, but most lack of energy. It took about two weeks for me to feel like myself, able to work out and not feel so exhausted all the time. It's now been about 6 weeks and my breathing still hasn't fully recovered. When I exert myself my chest hurts like when I was sick. Is this normal for recovering patients? I don't know a single person who's tested positive. I just set up a Doctor appointment for Tuesday. I feel fine otherwise but, what if I still have it? I'm looking for people that can speak with real knowledge/experience."	"Recovered...6 Weeks later So, I tested positive the end of March and was down for two weeks.

Pneumonia with no symptoms?	My friend got covid-19 positive. He is 28 years old, no underlying diseases. He doesn’t have any symptoms at all. But yesterday doctors ran CT on his lungs and found a little bit of “ground glass” (or whatever it is called) on his lungs. My question is: is that possible? Why then he doesn’t feel that? Could doctors have made a mistake?	Pneumonia with no symptoms? My friend got covid-19 positive. He is 28 years old, no underlying diseases. He doesn’t have any symptoms at all.

Test was negative but....	Results came back negative today but I don’t believe it. I got a nose swab test not a rapid test. Here’s my symptom list. Sternum joint pain, Immense chest pressure, Scapula pain, Chills, Shivering, Temperature, Nauseau, Headache, Swollen glands, Earache pain, Throat blisters, 2 second bursts of pain in ribs, Heartburn, Metallic taste in mouth, Sore throat, Jaw pain, and my personal favorite which I’ve named Fire Lung. 🔥 I don’t have them all at the same time. Every day it’s “what’s behind curtain number 3.” Days are better than nights. Around 5 pm or so, the party ramps up. By 10 pm, I’m miserable. Was my test wrong?	Test was negative but....

May seem silly, but any way to test if you had it once you’re feeling better?	How far along in recovering would someone be before they test negative? Or if someone didnt have testing available at the time it was at its peak we will just never know for sure? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask.

Questions for long haulers	Hello everyone! I have not had COVID, however my wife did, back in March. She wanted me to ask questions here, she's still having issues and none of the doctors know if this is post-COVID connected or something else. It's literally been six months since she had COVID and she's been vaguely fatigued and achey since she got better, however the last couple months the fatigue and achey has gotten worse. Last month she was in the hospital for chest pains that wouldn't stop and they did blood tests and chest xrays. Xrays looked fine, no heart attack, but those tests showed some weird blood test results. Her WBC is high and trending higher and her RBC is low and trending lower. Her sedimentation rate is like 50, and she's anemic. And other things. She went to the doctor, who sent her to the hematologist, her punted her to infectious disease because since she had COVID, all of her issues must be COVID (even though it's been half a year). We're waiting for the infectious disease appointment, but... Has anyone else had blood tests, and if yes are they weird?

Exposed to confirmed case, do my symptoms sound familiar?	I’m a student at a NYC university that’s recently had a couple confirmed cases, one of which I was exposed to in my dorm. I’ve been off campus for a week and a half now and started having symptoms come on gradually about 5 days ago; it started with extreme fatigue and a headache and then progressed to a sore throat (felt dry even when hydrating, stung when breathing, and was similar to a post-nasal drip feeling but without any actual drip) as well as a low grade fever (99.0-99.5) with strong chills, on and off mild chest pain/slight shortness of breath, occasional coughing, body aches, and continuing fatigue. This is my fourth day of having an elevated temperature; it seems to swing back and forth between normal-ish in the high 98’s up to lower 99’s with chills. Also, the sore throat has come and gone several times over the past few days, and it’s been kind of a roller coaster of feeling somewhat better and then much worse again. Despite my exposure to the confirmed covid case at my school, I don’t qualify to be tested in my state because I don’t have a high enough fever or severe	Exposed to confirmed case, do my symptoms sound familiar?

Accidentally got it from my dad	Hello everyone. My dad called the doctor to confirm that I had COVID-19 2 days ago. Previously he had it for about 2-3 weeks and now he accidentally passed it to me. I had severe chills to the point I hop in a hot, steamy shower to relieve it. I been coughing to the point my chest hurts, I feel winded from going up a flight of stairs or walk for a short while, I started to sleep more often than usual, and I lost my sense of smell to where even if my head is deep in a frying pan when making food, I can’t smell the faintest whiff of food. I been drinking hot tea to sooth my sore throat but it’s honestly a misery.	Accidentally got it from my dad Hello everyone. My dad called the doctor to confirm that I had COVID-19 2 days ago.

Skin Involvement/Blisters?	While reviewing my illness timeline with my doctor I realized that a few days before my first serious symptoms (chest pain, fever, GI issues, fatigue) I had noticed tiny red, fluid-filled blisters all over my fingers and hands. I snapped a few photos at the time to email to my doctor if they didn't improve, since I found it unusual. The blisters sort of came and went over the next few weeks but didn't disappear entirely until after my fever went away. I'm curious if anyone else (tested or presumed positive) experienced a similar symptom - either during the incubation period of their illness or after their onset of symptoms?

My experience with covid 19	Its crazy how this virus affects everyone differently, just wanted to share mine. I feel like I lucked out and got a mild case. Started feeling bad on Monday, fever, chills, body aches, and a slight weird feeling pressure in my chest?only really got worse when I was outside in the heat. Got tested on Tuesday and just now got my results today. On Tuesday I was still feeling bad, but not as bad. Chills turned to sweats as my fever broke on it's own. On Wednesday fever and body aches were gone, and ever since then I just feel slightly congested like mild allergies. I'm on day six, so I'm just chilling before I have to go back to work since I have to quarantine for 14 days. Anways, just wanted to share my experience. Stay safe and I wish all of yall who tested postive a fast and easy recovery.	My experience with covid 19 Its crazy how this virus affects everyone differently, just wanted to share mine.

I’m sick and worried - could this be the beginning of Covid?	Hello all! I started to feel sick yesterday with a light, occasional, annoying cough, nothing crazy. It has continued into today along with a tickle in my throat, a feeling of postnasal drip all day, and pretty bad waves of nausea. I had no appetite today and was only able to get one meal in in a window of not feeling nauseous. I just this evening started developing bad diarrhea. On top of that - my mom is feeling similar symptoms that started today for her. Is it possible that this could all be the beginning of Covid? The numbers have been going up in our area and, despite wearing two masks and gloves every time I do have to go out, I’m afraid I may have gotten it somehow. I also have asthma so I’m a little nervous about how it’s going to affect me if I do get it (I also have anxiety so being sick in the middle of a pandemic makes me freak out a little regardless of what I have lol). I also live in NY where the testing is pretty available so wondering if I should go and get a test or give it	I’m sick and worried - could this be the beginning of Covid? Hello all!

The Covid cough	I’ve been coughing a little here and there recently and am kinda paranoid it might be Covid. Kinda thinking it might just be allergies but my wife is also coughing here and there as well. No fever but a few days ago I had a weird feeling in my throat, almost like something was stuck. Figured it was anxiety related as I’ve had anxiety induced throat issues before. Was the cough pretty persistent or did come and go. I’m about 6 days past a potential exposure. The country I’m in basically needs me to be on my deathbed before they’ll test me. Anyways, any input would be appreciated.

I am genuinely afraid. Someone talk to me?	"So, my anxiety has been kicking in high gear for the past week. After being out of a job since March, my boyfriend (M36) and I (F21) have finally landed jobs. While we are extremely happy with our successes, I can't stop thinking about worst-case scenarios, and the ""what-if"" factors. He currently works in retail, and I schedule patients at a medical massage clinic. The only thing is that since I am constantly on the phone, I have to take my mask off at times to be able to speak clearly, and the other ladies in the office do the same. We both smoke. We both have parents that are at high risk. Heart issues run in his family, high blood pressure and cholesterol run in mine. Can you tell me your experience? Are there any smokers here who went through COVID? I've posted here before, but once again, my anxiety is not doing me any better, and I'm genuinely afraid to pass something along to him and our families. Some words of encouragement and success stories would be nice to hear. Thank you."	"I am genuinely afraid. Someone talk to me? So, my anxiety has been kicking in high gear for the past week.

Tested negative, but wait! there’s more...	Tested positive on the 10th of July. Began isolating in a hotel on the 11th for 2 weeks, mostly asymptomatic and any symptoms I had were gone by the 14th. I’m really thankful to have had a really mild case and not passed it onto anyone else. While in Isolation, I had scheduled 2x tests once I was free to go out, one the day I left the hotel and another the week after (which took place yesterday). Took both tests and got the results for the first one today which came back NEGATIVE. BUT WAIT Two hours later, the results for the second test comes in which is also a NEGATIVE. Double negative!! I’m clear and good and I’m gonna go donate some blood :) Anyways, anyone else feeling any after effects? My lungs definitely don’t feel like 100% capacity and my body is still exhausted from fighting off COVID.	Tested negative, but wait! there’s more... Tested positive on the 10th of July.

Positive test on Monday, negative test today (Friday)	Hi there, Got test results back today from being tested on Monday, the 7th. The test results came back positive from a PCR exam. I was in awe because my boyfriends came back negative, as well as the group of people I am constantly with. So, I decided to go and get a rapid test today (9/11) and results were negative, as well as my boyfriends. All week we have been touchy feely, (we live together) because I didn’t think I had it! (No temps, no symptoms, I’ve felt better than ever). We did take a trip out of state last weekend. The physician thought it was odd that I had a negative test today after being tested positive last Monday. Has this happened to anyone? I am still isolating until another test result comes back (I took 3 today for work purposes) She said it’s great because I’ve had no temperature, no couch- nothing at all. There’s a small chance it could’ve been a false positive. Just curious if anyone has had a similar situation? Thank you!

Has anyone been tested and had a false positive?	Last Saturday my mom and sister came to visit for my birthday. I've basically been hiding out from the world since mid February so I didn't go crazy, they just came into town for about 8 hours to celebrate and hangout at my condo. I had been around both of them unmasked for most of the day, then two days later (Monday) my sister tested positive for COVID-19. What I didn't know was that she, her husband and my mom had all been quite sick the week prior. They didn't think it was COVID so they didn't inform me of this until after the fact once she was tested. My girlfriend and I moved forward with the assumption that we were positive this week, I felt pretty bad and my girlfriend was asymptomatic.

My fiance just got done with working on a COVID-19 patient and stated that this patient was 62 (older than I by a while) but also did not have any underlying health issues and this patient was more than likely going on the ventilator. This patient, is on his 10th day with COVID-19 and this difficulty breathing was sudden because the patient had felt fine leading up today and now is getting a ventilation more than likely and now I am worried that even though i am younger, I still have a few days left to worry about the virus. When besides the loss of taste and smell, i have not had a headache or fever or chills/ sweats. anyone who went through this able to give some information would be appreciated! I am worried and of course my fiance is going to tell me the things that I	First Responder Hello all, My fiance works in the front lines and I am a first responder as well, I got officially diagnosed with COVID-19 a week ago today.

Does the sense of smell come back?	I have mild corona. Test came back positive and immediately I realized I lost my sense of smell as well as I can't taste sweets. It doesn't bother me that much. I am grateful I did not get very sick. However, do any of you or your relatives and friends got their sense of smell back?	Does the sense of smell come back? I have mild corona.

How many are dying from coronavirus vs how many are dying with it?	All of these deaths that are being reported seem to be old people with underlying health conditions. I don't know how to phrase this but some of these conditions and some of the ages might indicate that they would have died anyway, or it wouldn't have taken too much. Do we know how the deaths get reported? Let's say someone had a heart attack and while they were in the hospital they got tested for Covid and then died, would that be a Covid death? The reason for asking is to try and get a sense of how many people are dying because of the sole reason that they contracted Covid.	How many are dying from coronavirus vs how many are dying with it?

GI stuff?	March 28 I had a severe vomiting and diarrhea episode that lasted three hours - the sickest I've ever felt in my life - followed by two weeks of watery diarrhea. Thought it was food poisoning but two-week diarrhea should have resolved. Was told it was a stomach acid problem but am now questioning that, because I tested positive for COVID on July 8, after a June of malaise. Anyone else experience this symptom?	GI stuff?

Sinus pressure for weeks now, please help with advice!	Hello, I got horrible sinus congestion a month ago, like somebody spilled acid in my nose cavities, ears pressure, migranes, sputum, I took antibiotic and nebulizer every day with dexametasone and saline.. but it didn’t helped a lot. Lost completely taste and smell after 3 days, couldn’t taste anything at all. Now is 28 days since symptoms started, feeling still exausted all the time and I still have congested sinuses, I cough sometimes sputum. Taste came back partially, smell didn’t return at all. I had night sweats all the sudden yesterday, woke up all wet, pain in the middle back, cramps in the lower abdomen. I was isolating for almost three weeks.. unfortunatelly I’m on island, not im my town, so didn’t go for a test, my doctor said pn the phone it is Covid for sure. Did anybody had something simillar?

Large family exposed	So two days ago we had a friend over that we've seen frequently throughout the pandemic (our social bubble or whatever). We shared drinks, hugged when leaving, ate finger food together. Basically we shared crazy germs. Today he reports his wife tested positive for covid, flu like symptoms started two days ago basically right after he came over to our house. He developed a cough this morning. They are careful in public (masks and distance) and we are the only non family they see so unsure how she got it. We haven't seem them in the past 14 days so it didn't come from us. We can work from home for 2 weeks but Our roommates are completely unconcerned and plan on going to their retail jobs this week like normal. We aren't sick yet. We are both pot smokers with weak lungs but otherwise healthy early 40s. We have 11 people in our home- us and our 5 kids plus 3 adult roommates and their child. The risk for us to spread this is high given the other 3 adults all work retail or service jobs and plan to continue going.

Not sure what to do	Bit of a weird situation. But 11 days ago, my gf tested positive for covid and I tested negative. I didnt hold the results with much weight for myself because my mild symptoms have been coming and going. At first, congestion was the only thing that was bothering me, but I have pretty much lost my taste/smell. So, I’m probably positive realistically. The thing is, my son test negative as well with his mom and I haven’t seen him in almost 2 weeks. She has to go back to work on Monday and I am supposed to get him back on Sunday. Her work won’t let her take anymore time off because she just came off of 2 weeks quarantine with him, so I have to pick him up. Both my gf and I still have mild symptoms and don’t want to risk exposure to him. Might I note, we just got a divorce and both of our parenting time is limited and don’t want to give my ex wife any incentive to file a motion for more custody. We planned on wearing gloves and masks around him until we are 100%. We have plenty of cleaning supplies and were	Not sure what to do Bit of a weird situation.

Heart Palpitations	I tested positive in August and have had ongoing issues. Recently I started fearing I have Covid again because some of my symptoms came back - muscle pain in same areas and gastrointestinal issues - but I’ve also had a lot of heart palpitations. I was reading that Covid can have negative impacts on the heart - did anyone else experience heart palpitations? Did you color this with your doctor? My doctor has been pretty chill about my recurring symptoms and I’m embarrassed to ask her something else/feel like I’m overreacting.

Have a persistent dry throat today. Is it possible it's Covid?	Normally when I get a persistent dry throat it means I'm sick. I'm just hoping it's a cold or something. But I want to ask, has it started this way for anyone else. I have no other symptoms at the moment. I do feel tired, but I always do. And my right shoulder and neck hurt when I moved them, but I've been dealing with some muscular issue for a while now, so that's nothing out of the ordinary. Mucus is clear. Hoping it's either just allergies or a cold.	Have a persistent dry throat today. Is it possible it's Covid? Normally when I get a persistent dry throat it means I'm sick.

Did anyone else experience an altered sense of taste/smell?	This is my 3rd day being symptomatic and in the middle of the day my sense of smell / taste was suddenly altered. When I went outside, the air had an extremely strong smell of like vinegar or something. When I brushed my teeth, my toothpaste tasted really weird, not minty at all. Same thing after chewing a piece of gum. I sprayed my cologne and I got a faint smell from it but it was nothing like it was supposed to smell. Did anybody else experience something like this? It smells so awful that I can't picture myself being outside for prolonged periods of time even after all of my other symptoms are gone (assuming my sense of smell doesn't recover quickly).

Tested Positive	I started with symptoms around 7/26-7/27. I started with a sore throat and slight fever around 99.5°F but never going above 100°F. Then the headache started and last for 3-4 days what felt like continuous... it never stopped no matter how much Tylenol I took. I got tested on 7/31 and finally got results back on 8/3 that were positive. By then most of my symptoms had eased off. The fever had broke after 2-3 days of starting and I was left super congested, dizzy, light-headed and just exhausted. The weekend after testing positive I started to feel better until 8/11 when I spiked another fever of now 102°F and along came back the congestion, sore throat, fatigue and headache. I was coughing and had a ton of mucous build up in my throat and my chest felt tight and heavy. I decided to get tested again and was able to on 8/13 I got my results back on 8/17 and this time they were negative.

Post COVID fatigue? Advice?	I am entering my 3rd week of being COVID positive, and am struggling bad with the fatigue aspect. I only had about 3/4 days where I felt traditionally sick (mostly sinus infection like symptoms for me and nothing else). Once these subsided, I figured I just had a mild case and would be recovering quick. Well all the rest of that week even now I have been battling moderate fatigue. I can do my daily tasks, go to the store, etc. but I tire very easy. I am not nearly at 100% and the fatigue just feels weird. Like heavy behind the eyes, and Achey body type of fatigue. I would not consider myself sick anymore at this point I otherwise have no symptoms but this is lingering and driving me insane. Does anyone have any similar experiences? Did anything in particular help you? Supplements, etc?	Post COVID fatigue? Advice? I am entering my 3rd week of being COVID positive, and am struggling bad with the fatigue aspect.

Don’t lose hope! From someone who’s been sick since January...	I’ve seen so many people posting today feeling crazy about their symptoms, worried they will last forever, feeling isolated and alone. I’ve been sick for months, and I’ve been in this place with you for so long. My heart goes out to all of you...this SUCKS. For real. Here’s just a few things that have helped me get through: 1) The anxiety is real, but sometimes it’s truly the virus. Have a plan for who to call and what to do that comforts you when you have a flare. (Weighted blankets, baths, music, breathing exercises, a good cry...We even adopted a dog once I could get out of bed a little, huge help!) 2) Don’t stop asking for help. If your doctor blows you off, get a second opinion. Get familiar with your insurance and your options. Ask other people who they saw. Go to the ER, the urgent care, the specialist. You KNOW when you’re sick. Get help, fight for it if you have to. There are people who will listen, but they might not be the first doctor you meet with. Keep asking!! 3) Put your Devil Wears Prada attitude on when new symptoms come up, you feel	Don’t lose hope! From someone who’s been sick since January...

Anyone start exercising, running or doing Crossfit again?	Initially sick in early March. Very mild case, no fever, just headaches, tiredness and only a little shortness of breath for about a week or so. Recovered mid-March. I was very active and did Crossfit 5 days a week. Starting to finally feel normal - got all blood tests back and no inflammation in C-Reactive Protein Test, Neutrophils and White Blood Cells all normal range. D-Dimer was 0. EKG was normal. Since initial recovery, I've only been riding a bike. Only remaining symptom is period clearing of throat that could be allergies who knows. I stopped drinking coffee about 8 weeks ago - and I'm thinking I've got no energy because of that. Has anyone started working out again? Did it set you back at all? Let me know - and thanks so much!

What helped when you were sick?	Hi all - I’m a 24 F who works in the ICU and over the last few hours I’ve shown symptoms. And nothing is relieving me. I’m getting tested tomorrow but based on how I feel and how quickly this all came on, I’m sure I have it. When you were diagnosed - what helped? What mediations? How much did you sleep? What were your symptoms? How long did it last? Also, what did you do when you recovered? How do you go about disinfecting your home/car? Like what products? Thanks in advance y’all, stay safe.	What helped when you were sick? Hi all - I’m a 24 F who works in the ICU and over the last few hours I’ve shown symptoms. And nothing is relieving me. I’m getting tested tomorrow but based on how I feel and how quickly this all came on, I’m sure I have it. When you were diagnosed - what helped? What mediations? How much did you sleep?

Yet another diagnosed positive with negative antibodies	A little back story. I tested positive for COVID back in March. Symptoms lasted forever, my last major flair up or wave ended near the end of April. Went to the lab at my local clinic on Thursday morning to have the Abbott blood test (igg). Results today came back negative. Not sure what to think at this point. Doctor recommended retesting in two weeks.	Yet another diagnosed positive with negative antibodies A little back story.

I find meditation helpful. How about you?	I started doing meditation about the same time as I came down with coronavirus (6/19). It was something I had already decided to pursue and self-quarantine time just gave me a good opportunity to explore it. I'm only in the 5-10 minute range and I've learned a lot in the process. I'm already very involved in pilates, which has a huge emphasis on breath connections. Meditation does as well, but in a different way. The practice of being there with the breath and clearing out thoughts helps me be there for myself. Like I'm holding my own hand. Coronavirus is isolating enough as it is, and I don't get the luxury of always having someone with me, but I have meditation to help me self-soothe. What about y'all?	I find meditation helpful.

Just tested positive yesterday	I work in a long term care facility. I get tested every 2 weeks. About 2 weeks ago I had a constant headache and fatigue and weakness. Muscle aches. Taste was kinda off but still had it. My tummy felt so nauseous and had the worst indigestion ever. And I had chills and felt I was running a temp. I tested negative twice. I was tested last week and Monday I was negative. Sunday night I had what seemed to be a mild cold. So just in my nose was congested. Woke up Tuesday and could not taste or smell like you normally would with a severe cold. Yesterday my boyfriend tells me he has a sore throat. And ask me if I had any other symptoms. I coughed a few times. Went to work and they made me test after answering yes to a few questions. Did a rapid testing up my nose and another mouth swab. My rapid test came back positive. Now I’ve noticed the shortness of breath again. And fatigue as well. Muscle aches too.	Just tested positive yesterday I work in a long term care facility. I get tested every 2 weeks.

[17 M]Hypertension and Fatigue after recovering	I'm 17 male with no history of High blood pressure, after recovering from COVID I usually have a significantly high blood pressure of 132/90. I also feel fast-beating heart which was earlier not the case. I'm worried that is it some permanent damage to my heart and have to stick to medication s for the rest of my life. I was earlier easily able to walk for an hour but not just 30 sec of walking pumps my heart rate significantly.

Day 3. Thought I’d share my symptoms too.	I read through as many posts as I could! I see how many of us have different symptoms but if love to hear if anyone shares or shared mine. Also i don’t know what to expect in the coming weeks. Will this get worse?! Day one- fever of 101 but went up and down a lot. Stayed around 99 mostly. Day 2- fever came and went but not much. Stayed low. Waves of symptoms started. Sharp pains in my ribs and back. Almost like heartburn but sharper. Coughing started. It’s dry and wheezy. My hands and feet are ICE! I manage to bundle up my feet but my poor fingers. Couldn’t nap. Every time i would doze off, it felt like i would vibrate? What is that?! Day 3- i finally slept through the night. I’m coughing a lot more. I can not hold a conversation without being winded! I got up and dressed myself, washed my face, etc and then immediately had to lay down. It was like I worked out for hours doing just that. Completely out of breath. No fever at all today. My hands and feet are making me insane. I need my hands! My fingers	Day 3.

Is anyone here an asymptomatic carrier?	We went camping with a friend on Aug 21-23 who tested positive the next week. My fiance (29/m) and I (26/f) both got tested when he told us. I tested positive on 9/6 (fiance was inconclusive, but got a positive and a negative test a few days later. Classic). I have gone back to get tested twice more, including this past Sunday (9/20) and have been positive. My work needs a negative test for me to return, but my fiance's didn't so he's back to working. The CDC website and our caseworkers told us we can return to seeing people and going places after 10 days of testing positive without symptoms. My fiance had a slight sinus pressure issue for a few days but is fully recovered now. He will lose his sense of taste every once in a while. I have not had any symptoms whatsoever the past month. At this point, we want to be able to do more (see friends at a distance, go to the grocery store, etc.), but I still feel awful about going around when I'm still testing positive.

Anxiety or actual symptoms?	"Hi all, So, I was ""potentially"" (in my mind bc I was in close proximity with a lot of people) exposed on Saturday 10/3. I've had a very dull headache since the following day and a slight sore throat, though it may be the smoke in my area. I got tested yesterday (10/8) and waiting on results, but i am curious if this is just my anxiety giving me false symptoms because i have no other symptoms and have been checking my fever religiously.

Anyone who vapes tested positive?	I quit smoking cigarettes about a year ago, but frequently vape. I've had to talk to 3 different doctors today who say I am suspected, but due to the rules in my state I am not eligible for a test. I am still working with insurance to get medication, because I had to see virtual doctors my insurance isn't accepting an out of state prescription. I am trying really hard not to vape, but I think its causing me more anxiety. My chest hurts so bad, I've never felt pain like this before in my chest. Sharp stabbing pain and also heavy tight pain. I have all of the other symptoms like dry cough, body aches, low fever, headache. Anyway...has anyone here tested positive and actually quit smoking or vaping?

Direct contact with someone who tested positive	Sorry I’m advance i know everyone is probably sick of these questions I stayed with my friend July 9th-11th. She tested positive today. She said maybe she contracted it on the evening of the 11th or later while I wasn’t with her, does anyone know how likely that would be? I’m getting tested in 2 hours but won’t have results for a few days. I felt a little under the weather last night, but I also know I haven’t been drinking enough water. I’m 24 and I don’t have any major issues. I outgrew asthma as a child, but I do feel like I have a weak immune system because I constantly have colds and it takes me weeks to fight it off So what I’m trying to ask: could it be possible for her to have gotten it on the 12-14th and test positive this early?

Day 12 - No cough yet?	I’m on day 12 after showing symptoms on 3/23 (daily 100.5 fever that comes and goes, sweats, chills, diarrhea, chest tightness, burning feeling in lungs, back pain) and was curious - has anyone tested positive that hadn’t developed some kind of cough up until this time? I’m concerned because although I haven’t been tested, I’ve been following the stories posted here and my symptoms and timeline line up very well. However, I’ve yet to really start coughing. I’m wondering if the cough and SOB is coming, or if I just won’t get any respiratory symptoms. Also wondering if I should be concerned I’m not coughing this stuff up.

Sweating way too much and no signs of coughing or problem in breathing (Though it got pretty hard to breathe when I was just walking to the store).

I’m back again- should I quarantine in my room?	Ok so to keep it simple I’ve been having trouble breathing the past week along with the occasional dry cough and this morning my throat hurt pretty badly. Along with that I’ve been exhausted for practically no reason. 14/f with no medical issues. If it helps I’ve only been around 5 people outside of my family, and as far as I know we’ve all been taking preventive measures (unless they lied to me.) And we haven’t been social distancing because we are in each other’s family circles (meaning we don’t need to social distance and are considered family) so the only place I could have caught it is at the store or in a restaurant. Unless of course, somebody lied to me.	I’m back again- should I quarantine in my room?

COVID survivors; what were your symptoms? I think I had it but was not taken seriously at the time.	Hello! So back in February I got this NASTY sickness that never was officially diagnosed. I am 99.9% sure I had COVID, only because what I had was nothing I had ever experienced before. I was so sick I was admitted to the ER and because the US wasn't really taking it seriously at the time, my doctors scoffed when I asked if they would test me for coronavirus. I tested negative for the flu and they said it was PROBABLY bronchitis and sent me on my way with medication. I have had bronchitis before and it was nothing like what I had. It lasted almost two months, and my lungs only FULLY recovered about 3 weeks ago(I had a severe sharp pain in one of my lungs long after all of my symptoms went away). At first it was this really weird problem deep in my lungs. When I tried taking a lungfull of air, I would maybe get 50% there until my lungs just stopped me, I had this really weird bubble/gurgling sound coming from deep in the pit of my lungs. Never experienced that before. I was at work when I started to notice these symptoms, and	COVID survivors; what were your symptoms? I think I had it but was not taken seriously at the time. Hello!

Needs tips on how to stay sane/move around while in isolation	I felt symptoms on Thursday, got my positive result on Saturday. My husband has tested negative twice so I’ve been isolating in our guest room and only leaving it to use the bathroom/shower. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m not sure if my headaches and body aches are from covid or from not moving around or leaving this room. I can’t muster up too much energy without being complete out of breath and my body aches when I move too much but have you guys done any exercises (more like simple movements) that help keep you moving? Also, I need to either find really awesome new shows to watch or something other than tv to keep me sane. Please help.

Last time I saw my dad was Saturday evening/night and we were definitely in close contact with no masks. He noticed a fever on Sunday and my mom tried to quarantine him in the guest room. I’ve been around my mom in close contact every day since then. My dad ended up testing positive yesterday. MY symptoms so far: On Friday I noticed my eyes were burning and felt hot all day. It was almost like when you wear contact lenses too long and they dry out but I haven’t worn contacts in years. I have allergies but they only cause burning whenever I touch them after touching an allergen and it’s always accompanied by itching. I went to bed last night with a headache and burning lips. My lips felt like I had been outside in the winter for hours and they were chapped	My dad tested positive yesterday Hello! Please share your first symptoms you experienced with covid.

My symptom timeline (28F)	Saturday Night/Sunday morning: Woke up after restless sleep with a dry, persistent cough. The coughing woke me up multiple times throughout the night. Continued less frequently throughout the day with slight fatigue. No other symptoms. Monday: Developed diarrhea, cough becomes more prevalent. Tuesday: General malaise sets in and a noticeable fever of 99.6 (normal is 97.5) Fatigue to the point of taking three 2-hour naps throughout the day. Diarrhea continues. Very painful body aches, especially in legs/hips. Wednesday: Wake up with a stuffy nose. Elevated temp maintains around 100 degrees. Body aches continue in lower extremities. Cough has mostly subsided. Diarrhea continues but becomes less frequent. Thursday: Temp maintains around 100 degrees. Diarrhea clears up. Stuffy nose improves slightly but sense of smell has mostly vanished. Mild headache/head pressure begins to set in. Still fatigued. Does anyone else have a timeline of symptoms similar to this?

Help! I don't really know if I have Covid or not. Anyone have any advice?	"So on the 30th of June (or this past Tuesday) I started to feel the back of my throat to get a little ""scratchy."" At first I kind of accepted my fate that I had Covid and I expected to get a lot worse throughout the week, but really this is the only symptom I have had. I dont feel like I have a bad sore throat and it kind of feels a little weird when I swallow just a little. I just took my temperature today and it read out to 98.6 F, which was a big relief but idk how accurate my thermometer is (its a digital one for $10). I also took a test today but results dont come back until 5 days from now, so i'm kinda freaking myself out for now. Anyone know that you can have Covid even without a fever? Btw im 19 if that helps"	"Help! I don't really know if I have Covid or not. Anyone have any advice?

Dr John Campbell did a YouTube video suggesting Vitamin D is relevant to warding off Covid-19. If you have been infected, can you share your Vit D status?	[Link to the video is here](https://youtu.be/W5yVGmfivAk). If you don’t know your Vit D levels, perhaps indicate general sun exposure? Whilst this might not medically indicate anything, am interested to see if there’s any consistency within this group.

Anyone else feel like they're high on life since recovery?	"11 days from diagnosis, 16 days from initial symptoms. Louisiana. First of all, holy shit. Living and breathing are my most favorite things. Body aches aren't that great, so I'll leave those at the door. ---------- Story begins 2/23/20: I convinced myself that I caught a mild case of something because I traveled a lot for work and contracted an unknown respiratory illness. I diagnosed myself with walking pneumonia or bronchitis without seeing a doctor, due to previous bouts. I attempted to get a test for Covid on 3/7/20 and was denied over the phone because I didn't have a fever. So I chalked my symptoms up to allergies/exhaustion from travel and wasn't angry with the denial of a test. Then the United States shutdown. I got better, no worries, definitely just allergies and not covid. 5/11/20: There isn't enough air in the room. It's stressful but I don't feel ""sick"".

Question about being asymptotic	Hello all, I tested 4 days ago only because I wanted to be safe when visiting my dad, not bc I had any symptoms. The results came back positive today! I’m super surprised by this bc I have been very careful! However, I’m wondering, for this who were asymptotic when you got your results, did you end up developing symptoms? If so, how long after getting the results? Also, should I assume I got infected BEFORE the day of the test, right? Any idea how long I may have been infected before getting a positive result? I should add, I had another test, showed up negative, 10 days prior to this one that came up positive.

Chris Christie is lower than a beaten dog.	**Chris Christie tests POSITIVE for COVID-19 and he probably hates Donald Trump after this. Let me divulge:** First he pours his guts out for Trump's election campaign, and runs the Trump White House Transition Team, only to get shafted at the final hour by Jared Kushner in a perfectly orchestrated revenge move for locking up his father, Charlie Kushner. Now, Christie isn't running NJ like he once was, and probably could use the cash and certainly could use the political relevance points. When the phone rang and the words 'Please hold for the president' could be heard, Mary Joe (his wife) probably collapsed as she passed him the phone. If you read his book 'Let Me Finish', you'll know that she was persistent from the very beginning that serving the interests of Donald Trump will only come back to hurt him. He relented nonetheless. He was probably on the next government paid private flight to DC to assist Donald in his 'debate prep' against Joe Biden. I can only imagine how frustrated his face must've looked when he was watching Donald backstage in the Trump green room, as he most definitely disregarded any prep that his team contributed.

How fast did your symptoms start appearing ?	Kind of a vent, kind of scared, just kind of want to get my thoughts out. I was at my workplace today and it seriously felt like my symptoms hit me like a bus. Horrible chills, fever of 100.6, headache, and muscle aches came over me within less than an hour and have been rampant since. Come to find out husband has similar symptoms. At my workplaces insistence, we both got a test which should have results come back next week. Starting to get some cough and congestion developing now I just feel incredibly guilty if it does come back positive knowing I was in my office all week, and potentially could have been contagious without knowing. I know I had no way of knowing, but that is how I’m feeling right now. I suppose the test results will shed some light on it. Anyways, thank you to anyone who read this =)	How fast did your symptoms start appearing ? Kind of a vent, kind of scared, just kind of want to get my thoughts out.

For those that are positive/presumed/recovered (regards to initial load theory)	Seems like more and more studies are coming out from researchers saying the initial load determines your severity of the symptoms, now that more and more people are recognising this sub I feel we can get a lot of responses from experience So my question to those of you who have/had the virus do you know how you got it and how bad were your symptoms? Did someone cough or sneeze next to you? Touch a door handle and then your face? Have you been wearing masks outside? Even wearing masks at home for those living with others?

"Are people who are coming down with COVID-19 more recently still getting the ""false recovery"" about a week in?"	"I had a bout with COVID-19 back in March, back when it was still uncommon in the US. Back then a common feature was that a few days in (typically days 4-7), sufferers would go through a brief period of false recovery, where it felt like they were getting over the virus, followed by a crash of the same or even worse symptoms. I've been reading a lot of reports that the virus is behaving differently now, coupled with the drastic drop in mortality, and was wondering: is a ""false recovery"" a few days in still a feature people are experiencing with COVID-19? I had a very mild case, but the symptoms I felt were totally unlike any disease I ever suffered. My first bout was like an extremely weird cold, whereas round two was more like an extremely weird flu.

cannabis and covid	Any cannabis smokers in here? How does it effect you physically when you smoke? I've taken a break for pretty much the entirety of having covid and i just lit up last night for my birthday. Trying to figure out what the hell was happening, i've never felt anxious or anything from smoking (used to smoke 24/7 before covid) But last night, i smoked about half a joint and my heart felt like it was about to beat out of my chest and my body was literally shaking. I had to take a super hot bath to calm my muscles down. I'm not sure if it was the weed i smoked or the break or the reaction it had with covid?... But that was a weird ass experience, and body else have anything similar happen?	cannabis and covid Any cannabis smokers in here? How does it effect you physically when you smoke?

See flair ... got a question for those who got COVID-19	Hi all! I'm new to this SubReddit so excuse me if I'm not in the right place. A couple of weeks ago, I started displaying some symptoms of COVID-19. My body temperature was higher than normal (varying between 37.2 and 37.5) ... normal temp is always around 36.4~36.7! Didn't feel bad that day ... but had a cough every now and then. Like something was stuck in my throat? ... During those weeks, I had headaches for 4 days in a row. Some intense pressure behind my eyes. Felt very sleepy and started to have a stuffed nose. My sense of taste and smell almost disappeared. These things took about 2 weeks before I noticed improvement. The only thing that remains now is a sore throat. Strangely enough, a week before ... my kids started coughing like mad. A really dry-cough and they were less active. No fever ... What symptoms did you all display before getting tested positive? I'd like to note that I did NOT get tested as my goverment only tests those in need. They test people who get placed in the hospital or display severe symptoms.

Lost lasting mild fever	I’m on day 25. Most of my symptoms are gone but still have a mild daily fever of 95.5-100 F. Yeah, some days I still have some stomach problems and headaches, but nothing like it was before. That darn fever just won’t go away. My doc told me today that they’ve had some patients now that have had a fever for more than 40 days now. I’m just glad to hear that the doctors office is aware of this now. I’ve heard other people suffering from similar things here. It seems we are not alone, and doctors offices are starting to realize some of us are suffering for longer than usual “mild” cases. Hopefully in some strange way that’s comforting. 😉	Lost lasting mild fever I’m on day 25. Most of my symptoms are gone but still have a mild daily fever of 95.5-100 F.

I guess I'll never know	"My roommate and I both developed symptoms similar to covid-19 nearly a month ago. My roommate started to report difficulty breathing, mind sore throat, and mild cough. About a day later, I began to notice a feeling of heaviness in my chest. I mostly ignored it, because it was mild enough that I thought it could have been psychosomatic. My roommate and I began to isolate at this time, just in case. This was about a week before my city went on lockdown. That went on for a couple days, and it gradually became harder and harder to breath. Eventually, it was hard to speak full sentences without pausing to take a breath. I took my temperature and had a mild fever, 100.5 degrees. I never saw it rise any higher. By this time, my roommate's cough worsened and they developed severe body and joint aches. We both discussed having the same feelings in the chest.

They thought it was fake news. - Venting.	I’m so angry right now. My fiancé’s family thought all of this was fake news. Especially the mom. Slowly, she started to take it more seriously, but she still thought it was fake. And then her company decided to open back up and she went back to work (she didn’t have too much choice in the matter tbh, but she didn’t throw a stink over it.) Well. She caught it and spread it to her husband. Then, because no one in that family covers their damn mouths, the kids have it too. And now I just got word that my father-in-law is in the hospital due to lung issues. He’s having trouble breathing now. I’m so sad and angry. And I hope he’ll be ok. Please tell your family members from a me that none of this is a joke. Just because things reopened up doesn’t mean it’s safe. And now my fiancé is at the hospital with his dad putting himself at risk. Now I’ve got to worry about him too, but how the heck am I supposed to tell him that he needs to please protect his health too without sounding like a absolute jerk.

However she needs a negative test to return to daycare. We plan to get her tested this Friday, so 14 days after first positive. For those who had to test negative to return to work, school or daycare - how long from a positive did it take to get your negative?	How long from negative to positive test?

I'm 14 and most likely have covid	I came to visit my family in north Carolina and I have been going back and forth from my dad's house to my aunt's. At the time my aunt was telling me how she lost her sense of taste/smell for 3 days. But I didnt think much of it. I left there and came to my dad's house. Who has kidney failure it's been about a week since I left but just yesterday 09/04/2020 I started to experience very sudden symptoms. I had diaherra the day before yesterday but didn't think much of it. But yesterday I woke up with a sore throat, I started coughing and I felt sick in bad just in general. I haven't had a cold let alone been sick since 6th grade. (I'm in 9th now)I could care less that I have it considering the fact that the chances of me dying are low. It's just my dad. He has kidney failure and I don't want him to die. I'm very scared, I love him so much and he has so much to live for and he should get a kidney by maybe my my 10th grade year. I'm going to get tested tomorrow. Thank	I'm 14 and most likely have covid I came to visit my family in north Carolina and I have been going back and forth from my dad's house to my aunt's.

Covid 19 “Positive” for almost 40 days	Back in early July I got a test for covid because of work (I deal with covid patients on the daily) around two weeks later it came back positive. The state I live in told me I was good to go because I was past the quarantine 14 days. However, I continued to test positive past that. Now I’ve been “positive” for close to 40 days now. Funny thing is I called my doctor and the pharmacy I got the original test from and even they are saying it’s probably false positives. I have never had a single symptom this entire time. Anyone else have similar experiences? I wanna go back to work lol and I’m on my fourth test.

Still Struggling?	Post-Covid Symptoms - Anyone else? First Reddit post... *gasp* I was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the beginning of April after thinking I had a sinus issue caused by my sleep apnea machine; once my congestion cleared and I still wasn’t able to smell or taste, I got tested immediately (and was positive). Shortly following I had severe headaches/nausea, always exacerbated by screens. I was out of work for 7+ weeks and thought I had fully recovered by June 1. I finally got most of my smell/taste back by the end of July (although I still am not 100%). Within the past few weeks, I feel as though some of my issues are relapsing including issues with my eyes (pain/strain/motion sickness, etc), headaches, heavy-headedness, nausea, etc. Luckily, no loss of taste/smell. Another fun development is extreme anxiety and panic attacks (within the past few weeks), something that I haven’t experienced before — I did not experience this when I was actually COVID-19 positive. I do have clinical depression and throughout this “relapse” process have tried to adjust my meds to see if that helped with headaches/nausea. Slight progress with that, but not enough to indicate that the meds are the sole	Still Struggling? Post-Covid Symptoms - Anyone else?

Did anyone test NEGATIVE when you were sure you had the symptoms?	So I got tested yesterday, and my results came back today as negative. However I’m pretty sure my symptoms were it. I’m wondering if it’s been too long since the onset and that’s why it’s negative. Anyone else? I started symptoms last 2 weekends ago so it’s been about 10 days. I feel much better other than a pesky cough. So I’m wondering if I actually had something else or just tested late.	Did anyone test NEGATIVE when you were sure you had the symptoms?

Presumed positive-- lingering sore throat?	Initial symptoms started last Wednesday, so I'm on day 9 currently. No test, but Dr. presumed me positive based on fever, cough, and total loss of smell. Most issues have cleared up, but I have an on-and-off sore throat that just won't go away. It's worse at night, but is mostly present throughout the day. I suspect allergies are playing a role as well, but I've never had an allergy sore throat that's this irritating, so I'm thinking Covid-19 did a number on it. Anyone else have a long-term sore throat following their bout? How long did it take to clear up?	Presumed positive-- lingering sore throat?

A month and counting: those with extra long COVID-19, please share what helps you!	29F here, no previous health conditions. On March 29th I got real bad back and neck stiffness, then on March 30th I got feverish (37.6-37.9), the fever lasted 2 days. Since then my symptoms include: -some coughing (especially in the morning, it disappeared about 2 weeks ago) -pressure in my chest (constant pressure disappeared about 2 weeks ago though it still re-emerges sometimes) -upper back/neck pain (real pain disappeared about a week ago, though some stiffness remains) -shortness of breath (it comes it goes: as I’m typing this I definitely feel NOT ok with my breath) -GI issues (unusually gassy sometimes + A LOT of burping) -fatigue - it comes and goes as well: one minute I feel perfectly fine, and the next minute I feel exhausted - some chills - sometimes feeling heat in my face (no other ways to explain it-it’s kinda like the thing a city dweller feels after spending the whole day in the countryside) -simply not feeling ok sometimes - as if I’m about to faint The worst thing about all this is having no one to talk to.

Tested negative finally [Day 63]	Was tested two days ago and received a msg from my doctor this morning that it’s negative. Tested positive on day 13 and then 56. It was a nasal swab every time. No GI issues since 20 days. No dizziness/brain fog since 20 days. The occasional depth breath inability is still there but it does not bother my sleep anymore. It’s more so in the mornings than later in the day. But it’s annoying. HR randomly goes up a little more than normal on activity. Last 2 days the HR was good too but I had it this morning. Going to ask my doctor for blood work and scans tomorrow. Hope she approves.

70 Days of pure misery	So I got sick with this poison in the beginning of March, was not sure it is COVID-19, because had only gastro problems, like fever, stomach cramps and some diarrhea. Thought it is a stomach flu, was treating it with charcoal pills and some thyme tea, then it got to the point where I wanted to make a gastro appointment and see WTH is going on, until the very next day woke up with the sore throat, very bad cough, muscle pain like you've been hit by a train, and chest pain. FIrst week of that, said haaa, it is a cold, started to treat with paracetamol and hydration and vitamins, unitl a week later, woke up in the middle of the night with heart-pounding, chest pounding, shortness of breath and dizziness, nausea, and weak legs which landed me in the ER. I thought I was having a heart attack and will be with the the LORD soon when the doctor took a swab test and said seems like you've contracted COVID-19. Was gone through number of tests, blood, lung tests, EKG, clear which show nomral organ function and sent me home with paracetamol. since then pure misery and every	70 Days of pure misery So I got sick with this poison in the beginning of March, was not sure it is COVID-19, because had only gastro problems, like fever, stomach cramps and some diarrhea.

Tested negative, symptoms returned	July 11th I came down with a 101.3 fever that lasted 2 days. I had chills, fatigue and body aches. I got tested on July 13 th and was negative with a nose swab. They had me blow my nose and kept the swab way back in there for 10 seconds while spinning it. Since testing negative, I still have some fatigue, muscle soreness and feel chilled easily. Im not sick, but not 100% for sure. My ears today when cleaning them with a Qtip were sensitive/painful as well. Not sure if I am having some sinusitis which I never really had or if this is lingering symptoms from what I had 2.5 weeks ago. Has anyone had chills without fever weeks after, fatigue, muscle aches?

99.9% sure I have it now.	My friend has been sick for 2 weeks now, told me she and her husband were having difficulty breathing on Wednesday, on Friday the were admitted to the ER, CT scan showed she had pneumonia, the same for her husband. She was on oxygen and antibiotics, she’s pulling through, her husband didn’t make it, he passed today- both test results confirmed positive for Covid-19. Ive been having symptoms and a fever since Wednesday- today is day 4, my throat is starting to feel like there’s a knot and I keep clearing my throat. It started with diarrhea and chills, then fever, body ache, then more fever body aches shortness of breathe, migraines, now the difficulty swallowing and short, tight breathes. I have asthma. I’m worried, I’m saddened and I’m scared. My fiancé and I are officially quarantined. We reached out to everyone we’ve been in contact with. Can someone who has had it and recovered (anyone with asthma) please leave me note, give me some hope. Stay safe guys. Sending everyone much love and peace in these trying times.	99.9% sure I have it now.

Pretty sure I got it. Scared	Started feeling bad over the weekend. My symptoms are whole-body aches, chills, no appetite, in a fog, and fatigue. Walking up/down stairs even achey. Stuffy nose. No fever, or respiratory issues. The aching is the worst part. How do I manage that? It is getting worse and that is with taking tylenol/advil alternating at the max dose. Any suggestions with that is appreciated. Got tested yesterday and waiting for results. Very scared. I am alone right now.	Pretty sure I got it. Scared Started feeling bad over the weekend.

Dad (60M) has The Unholy Trinity: Parkinson's, Covid-19, and Alpha Gal	I haven't seen anything on here about people with Parkinson's Disease and Covid, so I thought I'd share my dad's experience so far: First of all, the past few weeks have been terrifying. I'll go in a lot more detail if people want me to but since this subreddit is mainly for Covid-19, I'll focus on what's relevant. So, my dad has three conditions that we're worried about: Covid-19, Parkinson's Disease (a progressive nervous system disorder), and Alpha Gal (a tickborne disease that causes weird allergies, particularly to red meat.) Around the end of April, Dad started having these episodes with breathing difficulties that almost mimicked asthma attacks. He was in and out of the emergency room and eventually, after two negative Covid-19 tests, it was determined that his issues were likely the result of not taking his medication regularly (which would cause stiffness and difficulty moving muscles) and anxiety. Basically, he'd have an issue with his airway and then he'd panic to the point where he couldn't breathe. It was decided a few weeks ago that he would live with my brother and his fiancee while we were trying to decide what was wrong with him.

Tested positive July 30th, tested negative August 6th - My personal experience to recovery	Hi all, posting my \[30F\] experience for reference and to give a little hope to those on the road to recovery. I was lucky enough to have only experienced mild symptoms. The worst was probably the first 2 days, which I wrote off as fatigue from spending a weekend camping, swimming, and hiking in Yosemite (the most active I've been all year). I took zinc, vitamin c, and vitamin d and drank a shit ton of ginger lemon tea. Days 1-5 I stayed in bed out of paranoia, though I was fine overall. I avoided any strenuous exercise and showed no true signs of fever or flu, my symptoms only lasted 11 days. Here were my symptoms by day: Day 1 **-** Fatigue (wrote this off as a migraine, eyes were sore and I only felt good when I showered), headache, sore muscles Day 2 - the same Day 3 - Slightly runny nose Day 4 - Same as before, loss of taste Day 5 - Same Day 6 - morning nausea, feverish (woke up kinda sweaty) earlier in the day, slight burning sensation in chest from time to time Day 7 - lower back pain, feels like back bones	Tested positive July 30th, tested negative August 6th - My personal experience to recovery Hi all, posting my \[30F\] experience for reference and to give a little hope to those on the road to recovery.

How long till I can see my girlfriend again?	So her mom tested Positive and her whole family got sick. She only had symptoms like loss of smell and taste and a runny nose but it’s been 2 weeks or 14 days since initial symptoms and she feels better except the smelling part. I told her I want her to get tested before I see her again. I haven’t had contact with her at all in those times. Would it be fine to do things again with her on day 16 or should I wait for her to get tested?	How long till I can see my girlfriend again? So her mom tested Positive and her whole family got sick.

Have you experienced any uncontrollable shaking?	Presumed positive, unable to be tested in my area since I’m not actively dying. My symptoms seem to have let up, aside from some pain and a headache. Yesterday I noticed that my head would not stop shaking, and it required a lot of effort on my part to focus on keeping it still. This morning, my entire body has started shaking and I feel a bit of numbness in my toes. Has anyone experienced symptoms like this? If so, did they pass? Or should I be concerned that there’s a greater neurological issue going on here?	Have you experienced any uncontrollable shaking?

Any recovered ppl exposed again and escaped reinfection?	I tested positive in April, had a mostly mild case but long haul. I'm just getting back to normal, and my wife and I came to visit my mother in law after staying quarantined for a few weeks. MIL hasn't been though. She's been playing it safe, but has been to her office daily and been shopping quite a bit. She's coughing like crazy and swears it's allergies. I'm freaked though. Of course I don't want her to have it (she kicked cancer's ass just last year), and I don't want to reset my own 5 month experience (or worse). We're leaving in the morning. And I'm going for a test next week regardless. I doubt she'll get tested. She still thinks that since it's only a cough she doesn't have it. (I keep telling her I had no fever). Anyway I know the jury is kinda out on reinfection, but has anyone been knowingly exposed post-recovery and been safe?	Any recovered ppl exposed again and escaped reinfection?

What can I do to “prepare” for the worst?	tl:dr - if you’re expecting to get covid, what should you do to prepare? I’m 16, live in Florida where everything is reopened. My parents don’t give a shit about the virus and thought it would be a great time for a family vacation. I told them countless of times “it’s not the best time to go” and “we’re not going anywhere.” yet we went anyways. It was to a water park and as expected, no one was social distancing or wearing a mask (the only time you had to wear a mask was inside the lobby, even though that’s the only place nobody was). Once we left we decided to go to another place, just to “look around.” This place was 30x more crowded then the resort. I told my parents to “turn around” but as the child, I couldn’t do anything. Way too crowed and 0 social distancing. Once we got into this corona-hotspot I immediately noticed people with their mask off. I then saw another, and another... I decided to count how many people either, wore no mask at all, took their mask off (even for a brief second), and people just wearing it wrong (isn’t covering	What can I do to “prepare” for the worst? tl:dr - if you’re expecting to get covid, what should you do to prepare?

Way too crowed and 0 social distancing. Once we got into this corona-hotspot I immediately noticed people with their mask off. I then saw another, and another... I decided to count how many people either, wore no mask at all, took their mask off (even for a brief	0
Diagnosed with POTS after covid infection :(	I was just diagnosed with POTS by my cardiologist. My pulse is abnormally high all the time and I've been put on a beta blocker. I was previously healthy and had no problems with my heart what so ever. This is starting to catch up with cardiologists in my country and they're seeing tons of people with no previous heart issue have symptoms of POTS.

Is it possible to not get the virus if you are living with a someone who has it?	Hey everyone, Me and my boyfriend are taking the covid 19 situation really seriously from the begging but last week he had 3 cases in his workplace and he felt sick as well so we both took the test since we are living together so if he caught it 100% i have it as well, we tested on Monday, received our results on Thursday, my boyfriend tested positive for covid19 and the surprise was that my result came negative, I felt fatigue and tired on Tuesday but no fever or coughing a bit of congestion i thought that i caught the virus as well but now when my result came negative i have no idea what to do or even if this is possible, please any advice or similar situations you know about could help, and if i should get tested again?

17 days after first symptoms, dealing with extreme fatigue, brain fog, muscle weakness	Does anyone have any advice for someone suffering these symptoms? I got better on days 7 - 11 post first symptoms, and since day 12 have been dealing with the stuff mentioned in the title. Those are my only symptoms currently, so I don't think I still have COVID -- no shortness of breath, cough, etc...just the mental fatigue stuff. Anyone dealt with these symptoms? Are there any resources for learning about how long this might last? Does anyone know of anything I can do to improve? Thanks in advance.	17 days after first symptoms, dealing with extreme fatigue, brain fog, muscle weakness Does anyone have any advice for someone suffering these symptoms?

Test came back negative but could it be a false positive?	I had a infection on my hand from a cut and got it treated. Around the same time I also traveled in a large bus full of a bunch of people. I wore a mask. A day after, I had a fever and chills most likely from the infection but once the antibiotics kicked in, it went away. Recently, I have had a light fever for the past 3 days as well as a scratchy and painful sore throat. Today I am symptom free. I feel 95% better. I got a covid test done yesterday with the nose thing and it came back negative but I don’t trust it.

Are my symptoms more than likely covid?	So, we had a recent confirmed case at work. While I had no close contact with that person, I was in close proximity with my co-worker whose dad works in the area he does. I had a couple symptoms that took place before my cough and sore throat took place (as well as fast shallow breathing) Thursday/Friday: I wasn't able to take deep breaths at all. Every time I did, I would feel chest pain, jaw pain and pain behind my ears. This didn't last very long, about 15 minutes? The other symptoms have been random muscle aches, fatigue, and a persistent dry throat. I lift a lot for work, and while I'm not the strongest, I can usually lift pretty heavy things, but I've been unable to muster any energy to carry heavy products and when I do, they leave exhausted. Same with simple tasks like walking up the stairs leave me winded, or brisk walking. I've made an appointment, and am not going to work for the rest of the week. I just wanna know if these symptoms were felt by those tested positive. :(	Are my symptoms more than likely covid? So, we had a recent confirmed case at work.

I was positive in June, now my work has me working the COVID unit.	It's been almost 3 months since I was tested positive in June. I have tested negative since then. I was asymptomatic, I just had a low grade fever which kept me out of work for 5 days. I work in a skilled nursing facility so we are taking all the necessary precautions and testing every week to two weeks. I'm just scared of getting a viral load and getting it again. I didn't sign up for the unit, I fought being put on that unit. I'm tempted to quit my job of 4 years because of all this. Can someone help calm my anxiety any?? Is it likely I'll get it again? Am I still immune? I just don't know..	I was positive in June, now my work has me working the COVID unit. It's been almost 3 months since I was tested positive in June.

Pain at base of rib cage	Hi, I’ve had symptoms for about 12 days now. Starting with fatigue, mild fever, headaches, sore throat etc. All quite mild. Eventually developed a dry cough and somewhat shortness of breath. I’ve also had chest discomfort nearer the top of my chest. As of day 12 my fever has gone but I have headaches, tight chest and fatigue. Today, woke up with pain under rib cage at top of abs. Feels similar to bruising or muscle pain similar to a heavy ab workout. Anyone else experience this bruising pain at base of ribs?

Did anyone have a false negative first?	So I started having symptoms Monday, got tested Tuesday, and found out today it was negative. I was shocked to say the least. Do not have a known exposure besides a vague some people at my cheer gym we’re positive about two weeks ago. I do not know who. my symptoms have been joint pain, temperature fluctuations, chills, fatigue, mild cough, and total loss of taste and smell. On Monday and Tuesday I had congestion and a runny nose but that has cleared up. If it wasn’t for the loss of taste, I would believe the negative. It’s so weird, I can breathe fine from my nose but I can’t taste a darn thing. My coffee is just hot water and I tried a spoonful of straight sugar and it may have well been sand. I have had no taste since Tuesday. My family is judging me for “not being relieved by my negative result” but I’m 150% sure I still have covid. I actually work a health department and have seen a lot of weird things such as person A and B live together. Person A is a known positive. Person B develops textbook covid symptoms a few days	Did anyone have a false negative first? So I started having symptoms Monday, got tested Tuesday, and found out today it was negative.

I have chest pressure, deep dry cough, shortness of breath , mild fever etc. My spo2 dipped down to 91 at some point. Im on zpack and got an albuterol inhaler. I thought my taste and smell werent effected but then i just realized for the past few days ive been complaining that all of our food is bland. It wont change anything i dobut i thought it was interesting. My friend with covid couldnt even smell nail polish remover so i assumed it would just go entirely.

Any other viruses going around besides covid?	So today I woke up feeling groggy, slightly nauseous and just overall icky and out of it. I slept a lot today like 3 hours off and on. I also feel a bit weak. But I don’t have a cough or headache also I checked my temperature it first said 98.7 then 99.1 then I checked it again 5 minutes later then it said 98.7 again. Also I feel somewhat overheated a bit. Strange thing though my senses are more heightened. Like if I stand in the kitchen in front of the cabinet with the spices I can smell the very strongly when usually I can’t even with the cabinet door closed. Also my ears are feeling a bit heavy as well. My mom keeps just saying it’s probably a sinus or ear infection but I’m not sure. I’m just very scared and too scared to get tested because I’ve heard how bad the swab hurts! Is anything else going around like ear infections, sinus infections, the regular flu etc? I’m just so nervous my anxiety is through the roof right now!!!	Any other viruses going around besides covid? So today I woke up feeling groggy, slightly nauseous and just overall icky and out of it.

Anyone who’s had GI issues?	Presumed positive here. It’s been three weeks now since my symptoms started, and the main one I still have is GI issues (stomach making noises and hurting after eating, some abdominal pain, diarrhea sometimes). For anyone who had the GI version of this thing, how long did those symptoms take to go away? I read a study from China that said people who presented with GI issues on average took longer to clear the virus from their system.	Anyone who’s had GI issues? Presumed positive here.

Anyone had symptoms like this? Drive through test on Monday.	A few days ago I started getting symptoms... - headaches - wake up every morning with tons of mucous in my lungs - coughing said mucus up all day - feeling flush but no fever - tired and get winded easily - poor appetite I’ve been isolating since early March but my husband works in health care. The nurse on the online appointment app told me that she would make a recommendation to get a test done on Monday. My husband has similar symptoms and we’ve been wondering if it’s allergies (it’s spring here and all of the greenery is blooming) or mold because we just moved into a new house but there is no signs of mold anywhere. I also have a 1 year old with respiratory issues. The congestion feels much worse today so I’m kind of panicked. In your opinion, should I be concerned?	Anyone had symptoms like this?

Doctor here looking to help	Hi everyone! I am an MD in the USA. My father is going through the virus right now and it's teaching me a lot. I've been talking with him through the entire time and been able to get every detail out of everything he is feeling and going through that has been unique from just treating a patient with corona in the hospital. I have seen the effects of the virus in the hospital and for those who don't need to be in the hospital but are still experiencing and handling it while isolated at home; it's a real battle. The media has numbed the general public to the virus that they think if they don't have it they are okay. There also seems to be a misconception that if you have the virus and don't have to be in the hospital it's not as bad as if you are in the hospital. Those who need to go to the hospital are the ones who are falling apart at a greater speed that they are no longer able to support themselves with breathing.

A mild case discovered during a not so mild situation	My case of covid came at the end of March/early April. It was a Tuesday already a few weeks into the shutdown working from home when we start to hear fire trucks pull up to our apartment building. We peak outside and see some smoke coming from the other side of the building and see the ladder start to come out to be placed on that side. Some relief at least that it isn’t on our side, but I wonder if it’s enough smoke to reach our side of the building so I check the door to make sure there isn’t immediate danger. No heat, but I look through the peephole and see the hallway is quite smoky. I realize that I do not smell anything. I ask my girlfriend if she’s able to smell the smoke and luckily she does, so that really made me nervous. While I had been feeling that my senses were diminished, I was congested the weekend prior, so I felt that explained the weakened senses, but was less so on this day. My girlfriend made some Indian dish for dinner and I could only really taste saltiness and a little heat (more like the	A mild case discovered during a not so mild situation My case of covid came at the end of March/early April.

Worried my dad may have COVID-19 because he was exposed?	My dad is a mechanic, and on Monday apparently he went to go and fix a forklift for a man who had no symptoms but tested positive the next day and was admitted to the hospital. He did not cough or breathe on my dad or near my dad according to his story, and the job wasn’t very long. My dad wasn’t wearing a mask and neither was this man, but the man was wearing gloves. My dad touched almost everything the man touched but since his hands were covered in grease he didn’t touch his face at all and washed his hands completely and hard for a long time to get the grease off his hands. He talked to this man for about 2 minutes about 2 feet away, the man was sitting in the forklift about a foot higher than him and my dad was walking around and fixing under it etc. My dad called our local health unit, and apparently they think he doesn’t require a test but his work wants him to get one anyway.

Presumed positive but negative antibodies	Hello All. I was feeling cruddy (fatigue) and had a fever for three weeks in March. I wasn’t tested since at the time tests were only for the deathly ill. Anyways, I was given the antibody test last week and it came back negative (IgG). Is it possible I had it and no longer have antibodies? I was also deathly ill end of December and into January. I had pneumonia both lungs, asthma exacerbation, lung infections and couldn’t walk on my own without almost passing out due to low oxygen. I honestly thought I would die. I have never in my life been that sick before. I wasn’t able to walk long distances again until March. I tested negative to flu, strep, mono etc. they said it was a virus but didn’t know what it was for sure.	Presumed positive but negative antibodies Hello All.

Anyone had testicular pain as a symptom?	I woke up this morning with testicular pain that hasn't gone away yet. I don't have any other symptoms and I feel generally fine. I've been fairly meticulous about washing hands and avoiding people, although I do still go grocery shopping several times a week. After a quick Google search, I found [an article of one man who had experienced testicular pain as a symptom of COVID-19](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/248680/20200408/coronavirus-causes-testicular-pain-one-man-with-covid-19-experienced-stabbing-sensation.htm).

I need help please	You guys I’m so scared. Okay so this is the story, I’m a girl from Washington state, I flew down to Atlanta Georgia to come meet a guy and I’ve been down here for about 6 days. About 4 days into my visit, things don’t work out with him and I have to book myself a motel6. I noticed last night I had a deep pressure in my chest and thought it was a panic attack, I took some aspirin and had a beer and figured it would go away. I couldn’t sleep at all and kept turning all night with this pressure in my chest. It’s the next day now 7am, this pressure it worse and I have sweat on my chest. I’m so scared and alone and have no idea what to do. I don’t have a way to gauge my temp and I have a flight to go home tomorrow. My mom is 68 years old and the last thing I want to do is bring home anything, id be so hurt if anything happened to her.. I’m supposed to be checking out of this motel and boarding my plane home tomorrow. Should I pack my stuff	I need help please You guys I’m so scared.

tested negative but based on the symptoms, could it be a false negative?	38 male, overweight, diabetic and high blood pressure, about a week ago I started to sneeze like a maniac, something that I though was an alergy (I never had an alergy in my life). I will try to mention everything that I have experienced during the last days. Friday I did the covid test (home test) because of a asymtomatic trial here in UK and I believe I didn't do it properly. I did another test in May (done by medicall staff, but the test got lost and I never received the results) and when she took a sample from the back of my throat I felt that my eyes will pop out because of the gag I had. When I did it myself last Friday I didn't do it that deep. I had a gag but not as bad as the previous one. Friday evening started some respiratory issues and fever (37C). A bit of a sour throat but I though because I've scratched it taking the sample. Saturday went okish but in the evening, I though I'm gonna have a heart attack.

Help! I dont know if I have Covid or not. Any advice greatly appreciated!	"Sorry this is a post from yesterday I just want to get all the advice I can So on the 30th of June (or this past Tuesday) I started to feel the back of my throat to get a little ""scratchy."" At first I kind of accepted my fate that I had Covid and I expected to get a lot worse throughout the week, but really this is the only symptom I have had. I dont feel like I have a bad sore throat and it kind of feels a little weird when I swallow just a little (tea seems work like magic cause it makes it go away). I just took my temperature today and it read out to 98.6 F, which was a big relief but idk how accurate my thermometer is (its a digital one for $10). I also took a test today but results dont come back until 4 days from now, so i'm kinda freaking myself out for now. Anyone know that you can have Covid even without a fever?

What supplements helped you? And what I'm taking right now.	Anyone tried nattokinase? Supposed to promote breakup of blood clots. That's my latest experiment. What I'm taking daily: Centrum Men's Multi Vit D 5000iu Vit C 1000mg x2 Zinc 25mg MSM + Glucosamine 1500mg x2 Quercetin 800mg x2 NAC 880mg x2 Flaxseed Oil Magtein Nattokinase x2 C60 Probiotic Tiny amount potassium 2% DV x6 Idk if any of this helped or I'm just getting better with time but I did start to feel better after I started quercetin. The NAC seemed to help respiratory symptoms too. Green and rooibos tea seem to help too though I'm not drinking much tea these days. Rest has probably had the biggest effect.

Runny and Stuff nose in the morning, slight fever last night - possible symptoms?	Hi everyone, Last night when I went to bed with a slight fever and when I woke up I had a stuffy nose which was a little runny. It should be stated, I have this bad lump on my left armpit that has been red and causing me pain the past few days and I think it started dispersing liquid. I checked in with the doctor and he diagnosed me with cellulitis, and gave me antibiotics for the infection. I've taken them and the fever is gone and the runny nose is gone too, though I still have a little bit of a congested nose. The bump on the left armpit started leaking. However the doctor also said go and take a COVID test (which will be hard to do, since Toronto's test centres are long and I lost my health card) in case due to the running noise. Have any of you had these symptoms or would you say since its getting better its due to the bacterial infection. Also having no cough, no loss of smell or taste	Runny and Stuff nose in the morning, slight fever last night - possible symptoms?

One bout of diarrhea and 99 fever?	Hi, was swabbed 2 days ago and waiting on results but currently freaking out making myself sick. i had one bout of sudden diarrhea- no pain beforehand, but I farted and it felt pretty warm so I went to the bathroom and lo and behold i had diarrhea. no uneasy stomach before or after. but i went to get tested- 99.5 temperature at the test site 2 days ago. have felt completely normal since the test but my temperature has been sitting at 99.0 yesterday and today. did anyone who tested positive have a similar experience, with no real symptoms except a temp of 99? thinking the diarrhea is unrelated as most who test positive with GI symptoms seem to have pain and more than one incident of diarrhea, but making myself super paranoid.

My mom has COVID, and my dad probably does too.	Hi. So I (23F) live across the country from my parents. They've been quarantining for the most part, but honestly the (mostly young) people in my home state have been very irresponsible about social distancing. Today, my dad (64) calls me and tells me that my mom (60) has tested positive for COVID and is very sick. He says that the symptoms are resembling a bad flu, but obviously I am worried because of my mom's age. I'm also quite worried about my dad exhibiting symptoms, because he almost died 3 years ago from major heart problems. He is in much better shape now than he was at that point in his life, but obviously his age and pre-existing conditions put him at a huge risk. He is going to be tested but has yet to show any symptoms himself. I'm going to stay positive and only try to imagine the best-case scenario at this point. Has anyone had someone in their life of a similar age diagnosed with COVID? If so, what happened? Please be nice, as I am clearly going through it and want a place to vent/discuss.

I’m getting tested for Covid	I told my family i had a sore throat yesterday but that was the end of that they gave me medicine and I thought I would be fine. This is also a really horrible sore throat. I’ve never had anything like this sore throat wise. Then i woke up today feeling super hot and i took my temperature and it was at 100 so now I’m getting my test. I just feel horrible because now the people I’ve been around might have Covid. I work at a restaurant but the inside (where i work) is closed to the public. And I go to my mom’s house, girlfriends house and my dad’s house. Other than that I don’t go anywhere else so I have no clue where this came from. I just feel terrible. I don’t want anything bad to happen to me or anyone that I love wish me luck and if I have Covid please just wish me a speedy recovery.

How long from the date you test positive did your result finally become negative?	So I’m currently on day 8 in the hospital! I tested positive on 24th March. Meaning my swab was on the 23rd so I likely had the virus in me since 22nd or 23rd only because first swab test on 20th was negative. Yesterday evening the nurse did a swab on me and just informed me it is STILL positive 😫 they will be swabbing me again tomorrow (the swabs are every Monday, Wed &amp; Fri). How long more do you think it will take for the virus to leave my body? I have no more symptoms EXCEPT for loss of taste and smell which is back about 10-20%. Does it have to come back FULLY before I test negative? Hoping to be out by day 12-14. Is it possible?	How long from the date you test positive did your result finally become negative?

throat congestion as a symptom?	Did anyone have throat congestion or phlegm in the throat as an initial symptom? I feel a little bit of phlegm at the bottom of my throat that sometimes makes me do a cough, and have had this for about 3 days, but overall can breathe just fine and have nothing else wrong with me. I'm wondering if it's just due to eating fatty foods or if this is an actual covid symptom, as a lot of people seem to get sore throats but I'm quite sure I don't have a sore throat as there's no pain involved.	throat congestion as a symptom?

Tested positive (pcr), no symptoms or known exposure on Sept 11th. Tested negative yesterday for anitbodies	Really not sure what to think here. I had to get tested for work - first test was September 11th. Results were taking forever to come back, so after not having results after a week, they told me to get another test because they thought they probably lost my first test. I tested again September 18th. On September 21st, I got the results of September 11th back, which came back positive. Then on September 24th, my results from the September 18th test came back negative. Just to be sure, I got tested again on the 25th and those came back negative in less than 24 hours. I decided to get an antibody test yesterday and today the results from that came back as negative for antibodies. At this point, I just assume the first test was a false positive I guess. In the long run I suppose it doesn't matter too much because I plan to continue to wear a mask / socially distance / wash hands / etc anyway until there is a vaccine available. How reliable are the antibody tests these days?	Tested positive (pcr), no symptoms or known exposure on Sept 11th. Tested negative yesterday for anitbodies Really not sure what to think here.

GERD from CovCovid	Has anyone that got GERD from covid (or as a result of) recovered from it once recovering from Covid? Or is this something I’m potentially stuck with for life? And I have a silent type with no pain, it’s sneaky, I guess no pain is better but it took months for me to figure out what it was. Weird feeling coming up from the top of my stomach into my throat: told doctor about it and he automatically went to “it sound like indigestion”. Then I get chest and throat “congestion” after eating (doesn’t matter what). And I’m constantly having to clear my throat and have post nasal drip feeling (even with clear sinuses). So this all leads to LPR which is the silent version of GERD, was put on medication yesterday to try to help the symptoms. I’m hoping not to be on it forever, because I didn’t have problems before.

Post Recovery Night Sweats	Anyone experience night sweats after recovery? I am almost 3 months out from when my fever ended and have recovered as far as I can tell without issues. The only thing that sucked after was the lingering fatigue and mental fog and that lasted maybe a month. I did some strenuous yard work yesterday in the heat and was pretty beat afterwards. Last night I felt pretty bad - Fatigued and just burned out. During the night I woke up with night sweats and couldn't sleep worth anything. Anyone experience the same in post recovery?

Can I hurt myself by singing while recovering?	I apologize if this type of post is not allowed here. Also, I’m not sure if anyone here is a singer, but if anyone can offer advice or thoughts from a covid perspective that would be awesome. Long story short, I had covid and am now testing negative for it, but I still don’t have my full lung capacity back and I have on-and-off chest pain and very mild shortness of breath. I also still get winded from stairs or standing for too long. The problem is, I have a video audition that I have to film by may 31st. I know the songs a bit but they’re not polished yet. They’re both classical an about 2 minutes long each. I know I’m capable of singing right now, but that my voice just might not be as full as usual. What I’m worried about is somehow permanently damaging my voice by pushing myself too hard right now. Does anyone have knowledge about this and whether or not it’s possible? This audition is really important to me and I don’t want to miss it, but I’m relatively new to singing (2 years) and I don’t know a ton about singing when	Can I hurt myself by singing while recovering?

Day 4- burning sternum	F, 30s, w/lupus &amp; RA. Got tested due to an outbreak at my work. I felt my symptoms (headache and mild sore throat) were due to allergies but I was positive. Each day I've felt different and it seems like morning, afternoon and evening are all different as well... there's just no consistency with this. My initial biggest complaint was a horrible headache which has left. Now I have this constant burning in my chest/sternum area. It burns more when I talk or sit up. My chest feels kinda heavy and sore- like someone punched me and my diaphragm area also feels sore. All of that said, I have no real shortness of breath and my o2 is staying between 96-99 (got a pulse oximeter before all of this). Honestly minus my chest being on red hot fire and heavy, I feel okay. I've definitely felt worse in the past with the flu or pneumonia. So what I'm wondering is if anyone else has experienced this burning chest and had it get better or did it continue to get worse? Is it an early symptom of something more concerning? Ultimately I know y'all aren't doctors and I'm awaiting mine to	Day 4- burning sternum F, 30s, w/lupus &amp; RA. Got tested due to an outbreak at my work.

Could this be a covid19 symptom or something else possibly more sinister?	So I’m recovering from Covid19 and I feel 90% better but today as I was taking a stroll outside my house in the neighborhood, I felt this sudden dizziness, loss of balance sensation and I was almost gonna fall, and the weird thing about it is that it wasn’t accompanied by any other symptoms like shortness of breath, facial numbness, headache/migraine or fast heartbeat, which makes it even more unusual.

Shortness of breath 24/7 only symptom	Healthy 30s female. After day 4 of SOB as primarily only symptom (very mild congestion for 1st 2 days), went to ER and tested negative for Covid. D-dimer was elevated, CT angio negative for PE or pneumonia. All other labs and EKG normal. Bought a pulse ox, and consistently &gt;97%. I am able to fully function with SOB (care for kids, house, etc), but need to take breaks after a while with exertion. It is always present, and practically unchanged for the last week. Antibody testing for Covid negative on April 23 (no suspicion, just took test b/c it was offered). Anybody have this experience? Wondering if it could be active covid, or post- covid symptoms after asymptomatic covid?? Will add that today/day 7, started feeling irritation in upper chest (that makes me want to cough, but I'm taking cough drops to suppress it for family's sake). Wearing a mask at home and taking all precautions just in case. Taking multitude of vitamins and baby aspirin due to high d-dimer. Cleared for work, and could physically perform job, but wondering what you all think. I really dont want to go back to doctor.

Dizzy, chest tightness, clearing throat	Hi everyone. Sorry if this has been answered but my symptoms are slightly different. I first got a bit of a tickle in my throat about 2 weeks ago and then I got a tight chest. It felt like pressure was on my chest and I got shortness of breath while moving about. I am physically very fit and I never experience this. When lying down my chest was ok but it was when I got up and moved around is when I would feel it. My chest got looser after about a week and i now feel the need to clear my throat quite a bit. I was also very dizzy at times and it felt like it would develop into more of a cough and chest infection but it never did. No fever or dry cough and felt completely fine otherwise. Anyone had the same symptoms as this? Is this anxiety or something else possibly? Thanks!	Dizzy, chest tightness, clearing throat Hi everyone.

Does viral load affect severity of symptoms?	So basically, if I wear a mask and take precautions, can I walk around and feel safe knowing that even if I were to catch covid, it would be a low dosage and therefore just be a mild case?

GI Symptoms- waiting for test results	I’ve been having GI symptoms that are getting more severe. I’m going crazy waiting for my covid test results. Symptoms are as follows: 1.5 weeks ago-now: heartburn (normal for me but this was worse than usual) 1 week ago-now: diarrhea 3 days ago-now: diarrhea became more frequent/severe and I started having pain in my upper stomach after eating. I’m also super nauseous, bloated, and can’t eat anything and have chills. I can keep down water at least. I haven’t had any coughing, fever, anything like that. I got a covid test yesterday and I’m so anxious to get the results back. I’m in Maryland and it was done through labcorp. I haven’t had contact with anyone I know who was sick. I only go out to grocery shop and see my bf who is also isolated. My next door neighbor said she just recovered from covid, but i haven’t had contact with her for several months. We often let our dogs out at the same time into our respective yards, which are bordered by a 6ft fence. 1. Do these symptoms sound like yours? 2.

Mild-COVID Case... on day 10 of symptoms, is it safe to see my family and boyfriend on day 14?	Here’s a little context: Saturday-Monday 822-8/24 - roommate ended up testing positive and I was a known exposure Wednesday 8/26 - lost my appetite almost completely Friday 8/28 - tested positive for COVID-19, only symptom was loss of appetite Saturday 8/29 - stuffy nose developed throughout the day Sunday 8/30 - Thursday 9/3 - very congested feels like a sinus infection, fatigue, lethargy, appetite progressively getting better Tuesday 9/1 - loss of taste and smell as of about midday. Friday 9/4 - current : no fever (never really had one besides a low grade one at the beginning), slight sinus draining down back of throat, less congestion (I had been taking decongestants twice-three times a day but now only take one at night to keep me clear). Still no taste and smell, though it goes in and out - sometimes I can smell candles on the first sniff, and caught the taste of chicken noodle soup today, appetite getting better every day Today 9/5 is my 10th day. Symptoms have definitely improved from their worst, and my body feels like it’s healing. I am planning to visit my family and boyfriend next Wednesday, 9/9 (the 14th day since symptoms began).

ELI5: As a recovered COVID patient, how does me wearing a mask in public help others?	This is a serious question from someone who is admittedly not very science-minded so please be gentle. I tested positive for COVID 9 days ago; symptoms began 14 days ago. I am already recovered. I know I need to stay self-isolated for a while longer. Everything I’ve seen about wearing masks depicts the act as mostly benefiting those around you; I wear a mask so you don’t get sick. That’s great, I agree with that 100%. But what if I’ve already recovered? I’m *not* sick and I’m *not going to* get sick (at least not for quite a while) so there’s no reason for me to wear a mask because I’m not catching or passing on anything. But if I don’t wear a mask, then I look like an asshole who doesn’t care about anyone else. Is that really a legitimate reason for making knee-jerk behavioral changes? I’m not trying to get out of wearing a mask—I’ve already got a bunch of cool ones that I wore when running the occasional errand before I got sick. But I also don’t want to end up wearing one every single time I leave the house just to make other people feel safer	ELI5: As a recovered COVID patient, how does me wearing a mask in public help others?

Symptoms	I had a possible exposure Tuesday morning and have woken today with a completely blocked nose, zero smell (when I can get air through) zero taste. Very occasional cough and no temperature. Medium severity headache, ‘noisy’ disturbed dreams. Hadn’t been out for 2 weeks prior to the exposure (emergency unmasked dentist appointment) Does this sound familiar or possible infection to anyone? Have small kids and I’m isolating as much as I can but still breastfeeding.

Blood type A and O research	NYT and The Telegraph came out with articles about how blood types affect susceptibility and outcomes. I know there has been talks about the research in China and a few posters have disclosed blood type. This article goes into the discoveries found in Germany, Norway, Italy, and US. Seems O blood type and A type patterns are the biggest. O having better protection and A are more at risk of contracting the virus and having more significant respiratory issues.

Seems O blood type and A type patterns are the biggest. O having better protection and A are more at risk of contracting the virus and having more significant respiratory issues. Would like to see if holds true in this sub, too. If you are AB, B feel free to chime in, too.

Remedies for loss of taste	I've heard that lots of people with COVID lose their sense of taste. I've interviewed over 100 chemotherapy patients for a project on dysgeusia (taste alterations) and can understand how important taste is. Food is such an important part of our social life and it makes people feel alienated when they don't know what something will taste like off a restaurant menu or not being able to enjoy a host's dish. I was curious to learn what are some remedies people have found for their loss of taste. I am working on a natural taste enhancer that was originally for these chemotherapy patients. Since there was some evidence that it could help them regain some taste, I was curious if it could be used to help people who are positive for COVID too. Would anyone be willing to try a free sample of my product and just let me know if it helps? I want to do my part and help in the current pandemic if I can.

Any experience or know of a link between Covid and rectal bleeding with clots?	Has anyone experienced or know if there’s a link between rectal blood clots and Covid? If there is a connection ,what does it mean for the patient if corona is the cause? The past few days I’ve experienced fatigue w/ diarrhea. Last night, I began to feel extreme weakness and noticed my throat felt dry. This morning I notice blood clots in my stool, something I’ve never had before. The color was a mixed between bright and dark red. I went to the ER and they didn’t find anything during the rectal examination. A few hours after I left the ER, I begin feeling more fatigue and laughing hurt. It REALLY hurt. I’m scared to laugh. At this point my chest feels tight and is slowly tightening. Breathing is a chore and have had blood clots in stool for a second time. I don’t feel right and this seems out of the norm. I am 24F, 127lbs, 5’7.

I am waiting on a call to get tested and mildly freaking out.	On Sunday I woke up with a slightly sore throat and I could feel my sinuses dripping. My temp has been between 98.4 and 99.1 Everytime I've checked it. Last night I had a slight cough and every once in a while feel the need to take a deep breath but no actual shortness of breath. I've also been alternating between sweating and chills and I'm exhausted despite not really leaving my bed. My job said I can't return to work until I get tested and I filled out a form and am waiting on them to call to set up an appointment for the test. I have anxiety so I'm kind of freaking out because I live with my dad who is seriously at risk (COPD diabetic just got diagnosed with lung cancer and heart problems) and my two children (10 and 4). Basically has anyone been tested positive with similar symptoms but no actual fever? And if I am positive what can I do to keep my dad safe despite living with him?

Do I have COVID?	I typically have really bad allergies. I’m allergic to cats, trees, mold and many other things. My boyfriend has a cat and everytime I visit I have allergies/asthma for a week or so. These past few days I have more post nasal drip than usual, I woke up a bit fatigued today with a very mucus filled throat. I’m able to cough it up but I’m worried it’s early Covid symptoms. My throat is also a bit sore as well. I visited a store like 5-6 days ago where one of the employees wasn’t wearing a mask and I had close contact with them. I’m worried I might have gotten something from that interaction. I have no fever and no cough.	Do I have COVID? I typically have really bad allergies.

After losing senses of smell and taste, when it started to come back, was it “wrong” for anyone else?	I had Covid 19 in the end of March, through the beginning of April. I lost my sense of smell and taste COMPLETELY with the onset of my symptoms. It is now mid-July and I still am not 100%. I get whiffs or strong smells now and then but nothing is at 100% or constant. One thing I’ve noticed though, is that my senses are “off”. I smell what would normally be a chemical scent like bathroom cleaners or hand sanitizer as very sweet, almost like cotton candy smelling. I work for an airline and the lavatory, which usually smells like a Port-a-potty on steroids smells delicious to me; like the sweetest candy smell you can imagine.

Left Side Burning Throat	Hello, guys just wondering if anyone experienced same as me. Basically I started having discomfort kind of burning/sore sensation on the left side of the throat around 3 weeks ago, it lasted 2 weeks with me disappeared for a couple of days and now it came back again. Weirdest part it's not painfull to swallow, it's just constantly burning, very annoying. Seems drinking hot/warm drinks removes sensation for a little bit.

Fellow long-haulers.. I don’t know what to do. Four months of illness, then “recovery”, and now deterioration. O2 levels are trash. Running out of breath, hope, ideas and steam.	I’m a generally cheery guy. I tackle problems head on. I’m a professional researcher. I’m a problem-solver. I give my best effort every time. I got the bug in March, in NYC, at a time when no one knew what to do. So I managed it myself for two weeks, supplements, rest. After two weeks my dyspnea and trachycardia became too much to take, and I went to the hospital. They didn’t have many answers. Gave me two rounds of hydroxychloroquine (which we now know does more harm than good) and sent me home after 48 hours of stability. Over the following three months I rested and took care of myself. Towards end of May I felt well enough to start some small neighborhood walking. The relapses were minor. Then something changed in June. My dyspnea worsened, the tachycardia returned. A week ago I went to the ER unable to catch my breath, and observing periodic low oxygen. They did a CT, and once I was stable they sent me home - no answers, nothing fixed. Last night I woke up gasping. Today I walked *around the corner* and had my O2 drop to 85. Tomorrow I see a pulmonologist.	Fellow long-haulers.. I don’t know what to do.

Need someone to double check a stat my doctor told me I believe is false	My doctor told me the death rate for obese COVID patients was 85% and I just don’t believe that’s accurate. I didn’t question him when he made the comment, but tried to look it up later but didn’t find a single thing to support his claim. I know there is an increased chance of requiring hospitalization or symptom severity with type 2 diabetes or even potential weight but an 85% death rate? Is their a single demographic with a death rate that high? If this is true, can someone link to the study or literature stating this?

My partner tested positive and I tested negative. Should I retest?	My partner tested positive on Saturday Oct 10. He was tested last week Tuesday Oct 6 but his bad symptoms started on the Monday Oct 5 (1 day prior to testing). He was extremely tired on Sunday Oct 4 and we were physical this day (kissed, hugged). When he got sick and felt ill on Monday, we didn’t see each other at all. We saw each other again on Wednesday Oct 7 (socially distant and in our own cars). On Thursday Oct 8 and Friday Oct 9, he felt a bit better so I sat in his car, but we both wore masks and were still not physical with one another (no hugging, no kissing, when our hands brushed against one another, we immediately sanitized). When he was tested positive on Oct 10, I went to get a test immediately. I was negative and I have no symptoms. It has been 4 days since the last time I saw him (Friday) but it has been over 1 week since we have been physical with one another. Should I get retested or am I likely okay?

"Possible ""Mild Case"" in progress? M/28"	So, someone at work had it and was sent home last Friday. I worked that day. Not to mention my room mate works at Walmart, and Im in one of the larger cities in NC, USA. First off, I dont have a fever or cough. Today I think I -might- be getting a sore throat. I had some shortness of breath a month ago with almost no other symptoms to speak of except anxiety. The week or so that I had some shortness of breath, the only other possible symptom was anxiety seemingly out of nowhere. I woke up twice, seperate days, to what felt like panic attacks, but went away shortly. Also had heart palpitations. This week, Im all of a sudden back to waking up anxious. I should note that Im also a meditator, and I recognize anxiety building up most of the time, it never just blindsides me anymore, or wakes me up like that. Also, every other day this week (like clockwork so far) I wake up feeling like complete ass, incredibly tired. Couple nights I just couldnt get to sleep for no apparent reason, other than that same weird anxiousness. Also have been having a	"Possible ""Mild Case"" in progress?

Should I get tested? Weird symptoms	So, after having a wonderful weekend, last night at bedtime I randomly began to get pretty severe chills out of nowhere. I slept fine, albeit with very intense dreams with some sweating, woke up without chills. Today, I'm a bit sore (but I played sports and hiked over the weekend, so it's expected), no real chills, no fever yet (highest it hit was 99.3 this morning but it's down to 98.6 this afternoon). I did have one instance of shortness of breath, but I'm easily anxiety ridden so it could be that. My glands were swollen yesterday but even they aren't as swollen as today has went on. Still, I can't help but feel like something is a bit off, I don't feel entirely there. Again, this could simply be my anxiety of trying to recount everything, who I might have been around. I've worn masks everywhere unless in big outdoor spaces not near anyone. My fiancee is experiencing nothing and we go everywhere together. To summarize, today, the day after the chills and swollen glands, nothing seems worse. No cough. Deep breaths are fine. I do vape, but otherwise I'm healthy.

Not as asymptomatic as I thought? (Day 12?)	Hey guys, F 21 from FL here. For context, I’m immunocompromised (genetic and from medication), overweight, huge family history of heart issues, and suffering from intense anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I tested positive for COVID on 6/13 and Saturday will be my 3rd week of infection (at least as far as I’m aware- I have no idea when I got it and testing took a week for results so I’m using 6/13 as a “minimum” starting date). I’d assumed I was asymptomatic up until this week. The weirdest thing started up- the inside of my nose started burning? It feels like the buildup right before you sneeze without the payoff. It’s continued on and off for a few days. I’ve also been feeling a dry, almost burning feeling in my chest as well. It’s not necessarily hard to breathe, but it’s definitely not comfortable. No coughing, thankfully. These symptoms had me thinking about an odd feeling I’ve been having throughout this month- I’ve had the most random, short bursts of high blood pressure and fast heart rate, followed by an almost disturbingly more mellow beat once it passes, like nothing happened.

Is it possible to recover in one day?	Just a little background about me, I'm 27 years old and pretty healthy. The neighborhood that I live in is the worst hit in my country and several of my neighbors have the virus. So three days ago a few hours before going to bed, I started developing a mild cough. When I woke up the next day I had this strange metallic taste in my mouth, I had a dry cough, sore throat, could barely taste any food and a headache all day. I was sure that I had the virus. But the next day, every symptom was gone except for the sore throat, which took another day to go away. Could I have had the virus and recovered that quickly? I tried googling it but found no one else. I have not had a test yet or spoken to a doctor.	Is it possible to recover in one day?

Entire office exposed, but we all had a rapid test that came back negative. Chances of false negatives!	So basically. Yesterday at work we found out we all had pretty much prolonged direct exposure to someone positive for COVID19. I’m posting this anonymously but I am prettty mad about it. I work in a clinic and one of the doctors thought COVID was a big joke meant to scare people. He refused to wear a mask at any point. I work directly with him and more closely with him than anyone else. I have two children, one isn’t even 5 months old yet.. Anyway, he knew he wasn’t feeling well for a like 5 days before he went and got tested. He can’t back positive. They sent us all for rapid tests and sent us home by the end of the day. Then our boss texted us last night and said that everyone whose tests were back were negative and expected to return to work. Now I’m not sure if the symptoms I’ve been having were anxiety related, etc. but I also did some research that the chances of a false negative decrease each day after exposure.

Now I’m not sure if the symptoms I’ve been having were anxiety related, etc. but I also did some research that the chances of a false negative decrease each day after exposure. We could have	0
Tested positive a week ago, with almost no symptoms but I have noticed that my snot is white. Anyone else have something like this?	I have had slight chest tightness that mostly came at night for maybe a half hour, some stuffiness in my nose and occasional headache and that is it so far with the exception that I noticed that anything that comes out of my nose is white and not green. I am assuming this is related but not sure. Anyone with similar experiences?	Tested positive a week ago, with almost no symptoms but I have noticed that my snot is white.

If I have lingering bronchitis from an earlier respiratory infection, how much higher are my risks of CV-19 infection/CV-19 pneumonia? For those who tested positive, did preexisting (acute) bronchitis contribute to the severity or duration of your illness?	It's probably a dumb question, but I haven't found a satisfying answer online that's specific to CV-19, and I'm trying to gauge what to possibly expect if I get infected. I'm 28F, and average weight. My general risks outside of my bronchitis issue are: presumptive lifelong asthmatic, light to moderate smoker, cardiac arrhythmia issues (inappropriate sinus tachycardia, but it's mostly handled with medication), and blood pressure that's been fluctuating from my usual low-normal to pre-hypertensive/hypertensive since November according to vitals taken at multiple appointments at my specialists' offices (my cardiologist is urging me to get a BP monitor, but with my classes and attempting to conserve money, I've put it off, but I'm going to get one soon). I get at least one respiratory infection a year usually during flu season (flu vaccine only covers so much), and as a disclaimer, I do not believe it's CV-19. It's terrible timing though, and I was worried for a bit, but I'm pretty sure CV would absolutely kick my ass. This has been a pretty lucky year since the cough isn't that bad, and even though I've had bronchitis since late February, I feel like it's too mild to get checked out;	If I have lingering bronchitis from an earlier respiratory infection, how much higher are my risks of CV-19 infection/CV-19 pneumonia?

2months in the covid19 journey, Anyone feel the SOb is worse on the day when reflux symptom is bad?	Hi all survivors, I am two months in.. feel much stronger than 2 weeks ago, even though not 100% myself yet but I am grateful to be able to get on with my daily tasks ( and home working). I still have many symptoms as many of you have : heart rate issues, pins and needles/numbness in the feet / fingers ( they got red and burning).. think my blood circulation is not as good as before. I remain positive and I noticed I smile more and more. One of the things really remind me every day that I have covid is my breathing-SOB.. I have tight chest some days, but most day I have this mild SOB, the feeling of needs to take deep breath ( like I forgot how to breath), when trying to take in deep satisfying breath I just cannot , lit’s like I cannot complete the action, and not get enough air in my lung yet I cannot expand my lungs anymore.. it often helps if I yawn in order to get the air in..

Self Swab	So, I got tested yesterday at a Rite Aid Project Baseline drive thru and I wasn't expecting the test to be a self swab. I'm just worried now that maybe I didn't put the cotton swab deep enough and that the test won't be accurate. I was definitely teary eyed when putting it in and my nose hurt for like 15 mins after too. Anyone with this experience?

My second infection with covid and the results	Got covid originally on the 22nd of March, had chronic fatigue syndrome after. Last two weeks I went to work because I had to. And 6 days ago a man on the bus stood behind my seat, unnecessarily wheezing in my ear. I turned around and recognised his symptoms (you know those bloodshot eyes, wheezing, obviously flushed with fever, and looking disoriented and not all there in the head). I got up from my seat and went elsewhere. But later that night came down with a fever, and the next day another fever and some dizziness, and then the next day shortness of breath and elevated heart rate (around 90 not like before at 125). Today is the fifth day, the day I expected to either get really bad symptoms like last time, or for it to cool off. Seems to be cooling off and going away. So my takeaway is this, you can recatch it, it will develop into symptoms for a week or more, but will be milder than it was (but more severe than the cfs you get after). So symptoms were like I got on week 3-4 of the first bout basically.

Question regarding 14 day quarantine	"I have a question about when it's safe to come in contact with someone who was quarantined. My mother in law was in direct maskless contact with her coworker who tested positive. Her last interaction with him was almost two weeks ago, (this jackass showed up at their vet clinic when he was symptomatic, his test came back positive the next day) and she's been quarantining since then. She hasn't had any symptoms so far and she doesn't want to take a test because she thinks it's ""unnecessary"". Yes, I know she's stupid. Am I wrong for thinking we shouldn't go see her for at least another week beyond the 14 days, in case she's asymptomatic positive?"

Healthcare worker suffering	My best friend/X-ray tech is currently in the ICU, sedated and ventilated for over a week. She crashed and almost died this past weekend. She works at a hospital with a high population of Covid positive inpatients. Her morning rounds include repeated visits to airborne/droplet precaution patient rooms to perform portable exams. One of the last things she texted me when she was in the ER before losing energy was “I’m scared.” If you can find the time to include her in your prayers, I’d be very grateful. She is in her early 30’s and has family &amp; friends who love her very much.	Healthcare worker suffering My best friend/X-ray tech is currently in the ICU, sedated and ventilated for over a week.

When do blood clots/DVT usually happen?	I'm on Day 69 of symptoms and the latest is really uncomfortable cramping in my left leg, mostly in the calf but also the Achilles area and below the knee. It started about a week ago. I don't notice swelling or hot/cold skin anywhere in the area. I have been trying to go out for short walks lately so it could just be my body reacting to being somewhat active again. Early on I had really bad leg soreness but that mostly went away once the shortness of breath and persistent cough came along. This new feeling is different though. Are people developing clots 2 months after initial onset of symptoms? I couldn't get a diagnostic test until late-April and my result was negative, as I assumed it would be considering I already had symptoms for about 5 weeks at that point.

Very scared I’ve somehow contracted the virus?	Basically for the last week I’ve felt dizzy all the time, and quite tired each day and haven’t slept particularly well, before this for 3 days I had a weird shock feeling in my left foot when moving it. I’ve also had some pretty brain fog and head fuzziness/ pressure and on and off sinus pressure. It’s now a week on and I still feel lightheaded, tired and fuzzy headed. I had a similar feeling bar the foot and nasal feeling last year in October due to anxiety, I’m pretty sure I have a proem with it. This came in 4 days before my job interview, however it hasn’t gone away and worried it’s actually covid. I didn’t wear a mask in my interview and was close to someone for around 15 minutes without a mask, I had to take it off. I’ve also felt slightly cold at times. I’ve rarely been out, no restaurants, pubs nothing. Only a driving lesson once every two weeks where I wear a mask and keep the widows open, been down to the bank but all masked up, I’m just so tired, anxiety or covid, I’m so frightened, I live parents and my dad	Very scared I’ve somehow contracted the virus?

I am fairly certain that I have COVID-19 and I am just terrified	So, a friend of mine that I saw in person on Tuesday of last week texted me last Friday saying that he's been feeling feverish / achey. This immediately concerned me because I had been around him for about an hour inside of his home a few days before he started showing symptoms. Fast forward to Sunday, I woke up feeling feverish / achey. Woke up Monday, gone. Monday night I stupidly had a really strong cup of coffee at 11PM and was up until 5-6AM and got about 2 hours sleep. On Tuesday morning the low-grade fever / body aches resumed and I've had them ever since. So, today is technically day 6 of being sick for me. I have a low-grade fever (99.8F), body aches (which have actually gotten better in the last 2-3 days), sometimes headaches, and, last night, I felt some stomach discomfort. Also, I've been experiencing congestion / runny nose / what feels like postnasal drip. All in all, I still have my appetite and I've been taking Motrin which *completely* gets rid of all symptoms. Once the Motrin wears off I start feeling feverish / achey again.

Lupus, RA, Diabetes... Long Hauling	I see very little talk about this on the news as well as on this forum and I decided I’d bring it up. All 3 titled chronic conditions are known to be caused by infection. The idea of autoimmune disorders has been brought up before as seen when searching through this forum, and ANA tests have been done and come back positive. A positive ANA could mean anything but it also happens to work as intended, a predictor for autoimmune disorders. I’m 17, male, and have been perfectly healthy since I can remember. One day I’m kicked to the curb and it continues for a month? You can check my post history, I’ve been through it, recovered perfectly, and relapsed soon after. I’m only a month in. Who knows what’s waiting in the future, but every day is different. Research needs to be done on this long haul syndrome being discussed. Covid has already been observed to have caused Type 1 Diabetes. What else could it cause? Are symptoms temporary, or permanent?

Asymptomatic	I just got a new job and my employer asked me to get tested before coming into the office. Lo and behold! My test results came back positive.

Doc says that someone with COPD and high blood pressure isn't at risk. Thanks Sherlock	"(I caught covid in March, my mum either didn't catch it or was incredibly lucky and didn't have 100% noticeables symptoms.) My mum has COPD and high blood pressure. She obviously is at risk, every doc she talked with recognises it... except today's doc. My mum's a teacher, school starts next Monday, cases are rising again in my country (France), no measures are being taken except masks. No distancing, no online school, nothing. So, she went to the doc today, it wasn't her habitual doc (which is also incompetent but at least recognises that she's at risk). This one didn't offer any explanation to her vertigo sensations she's been having for the last two weeks, she was like ""blood pressure's fine"" and that's it. My mother asked if she should go back to school (she won't but needs a doctor's note). This doc told her ""you're not at risk, people at risk are 65+"". And bye. I am very angry: this is pathetic and hilarious in a way... Of course, this doc didn't wear a N95 mask - although she could, they're available to docs here, my mum's doc has them.

Covid-19 aunt back in March	Covid-19 information positive? I am a 21 year old person staying with my parents and family members at house in New York. During the first month of quarantine which was in March , my aunt got sick with the virus and she had symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue and loss of taste. She managed to recover and albeit to her knowledge she spread the virus to us. We did not succumb to the virus, which is shocking considering my uncle is diabetic. I am trying to study the virus as best as I can. But I guess I want more information regarding the virus. Any information can be helpful thanks. Also she tested positive for antibody while all of us negative. Idk how is this possible.	Covid-19 aunt back in March Covid-19 information positive?

Phlegm in throat	So am pretty sure I got it in March. It was ruled as bronchitis. It’s been 3 months and I can still feel phlegm in my throat. It is evident because when I take a deep breath I can feel it lodged. Anyone else have this issue?	Phlegm in throat So am pretty sure I got it in March. It was ruled as bronchitis.

How to deal with this? 💔	I know I should not post here anymore. I mean, there's no more updates to give. He's gone. He passed away two days ago. There's no one that has the virus in my family right now. If you've been following my story, you know that my dad contracted the virus. He fought until he couldn't do it anymore. I'm wearing his clothes. His old pajamas. The ones he wouldn't want to get rid of. I'm also sleeping in his bed. The one he shared with my mom, because I know she needs me to do it. I'm sleeping where he should be sleeping right now. She could never stand the thought of being alone. She couldn't be without him. My mom and dad got married 30 years ago. There's clothes he wore at home before being hospitalised that we never touched. We should have washed them a long time ago, but we forgot about them. The house is awfully quiet. I don't sleep much, I forgot the feeling of being hungry, and I cry a lot. I feel empty inside. I'm tired all the time. Emotionally tired. I still play with my dog everyday, but right now I can't enjoy	How to deal with this? 💔 I know I should not post here anymore. I mean, there's no more updates to give. He's gone.

How long after testing positive will I test negative?	Hello, I hope everyone is going through a speedy recovery, I finally feel 100%. I started showing symptoms on Friday 7/24, got tested and confirmed + on 7/26, I was experiencing symptoms the first 5 days (chills, body aches, fever, no appetite, exhaustion, no taste/smell) today is day 11 from the first day of symptoms and I still have no sense of taste or smell but all other symptoms have been gone for at least 72 hours, I feel much better, my energy and appetite is back but I don’t know if it’s too soon to go get tested again? I know of a place where I can get a rapid test done and find out on the spot, do you guys think it’s too early? Or would it be a good time since I no longer have symptoms? I’m isolating at a hotel &amp; just want to figure out when I can go back home to my family, let me know what you guys think, your feedback is much appreciated.

Have any of you tested positive, experienced mild symptoms, tested negative twice 18 days later, then tested positive a week after your last negative result?	That’s exactly what happened to me. I didn’t think it would have been possible to catch it again this quickly. I’m going to get another test done on Monday but I’m just in shock. I don’t have any symptoms, just the slight loss of smell and taste I experienced since I got it 25 days ago. Is it possible to get reinfected again this quickly? Sorry I’m freaking out.

Sleepless nights after Covid-19 recovery	I recovered from a mild case of Covid-19 about 10 days ago. I generally feel fine But my sleep cycle has been disrupted completely. I usually slept for 8+ hrs but now that has come down to less than 5 hrs. That makes me lethargic and out of focus through the day. I have added an hours exercise in my daily routine but that has not helped. Anyone else going through the same?

22 year old’s experience with covid	Here’s my experience with covid so far. I’m 22 years old, very healthy and active, yet I still got hit pretty hard with covid. I’m presumed positive by doctors, and I’m taking a test later today to confirm. It all started when my boyfriend developed a dry cough about 2 weeks ago. I didn’t think much of it, because he didn’t have other symptoms, so we just assumed it was allergies. However, the cough became pretty persistent and uncontrollable, so he got tested for covid just to be sure. We’re still waiting on the results. I developed symptoms about a week after him; below has been my experience so far. Days 1-3: headache that isn’t alleviated with otc meds. Sinus pressure. Tiredness. Diarrhea on day 3 - I just assumed it was allergies at this point Day 4: severe headache, sore throat started to develop Day 5: sore throat, extreme shortness of breath, dry cough that eventually turned productive, chest tightness - felt like weights were placed on chest, fever, wheezing, stabbing pains in chest, excessive thirst, chills, pain in gums and ears - debated about going to the hospital at this point, because I was gasping for air and	22 year old’s experience with covid Here’s my experience with covid so far.

Minimal Symptoms w/ Complete Loss of Smell (Aspirin “Cured” Me)	I remember 3 days before I started showing symptoms my fiancée had told me of her inability to smell. Fast forward 3 days and I have a slight fever, body aches which grew worse as time moved, and a migraine headache, which all somehow almost instantaneously disappeared after taking an large dose of aspirin? I now am wondering how effective aspirin might be in certain individuals with the virus considering the variety in severity. Am now positive with absolutely no sense of smell, can’t smell any cleaning chemicals, alcohols, soaps, fragrances, or even my own armpits (rip deodorant).

Onions/ spices taste and smell bad now?	"Hello everyone, I tested positive early July and tested negative late July. I had relatively mild symptoms that started off as a fever, a raging headache, sinus pressure and then loss of taste/smell. My sense of taste/smell came back slowly a couple weeks later and have been present but dull. In fact I couldn't smell ""bad"" smells like garbage, smoke, or foul smells,. I could still enjoy food but it was obvious that not all my senses were there and it tasted somewhat dull. Lately, I've been able to smell certain bad smells but now it seems that me cooking eggs, ham, onions, tomatoes triggers a bad taste/smell. Its almost like something is rancid and the things I used to enjoy don't taste as good, and the rancid taste is so off putting I'm throwing away food I know is delicious. Has anyone gone through this after contracting co-vid? Will it go away? I can still eat other foods but there's foods that I've eaten all my life that just taste disgusting now and it makes me sad :( Its been about a week now."	"Onions/ spices taste and smell bad now?

My cousins just tested positive for the antibody test for an illness they had back in February.	Absolutely crazy to me that we now have confirmation that this has been spreading a lot longer than we thought originally... My cousin (30) and her daughter (11) both tested positive for the antibody test. They were both really sick back in early February and her daughter got hospitalized for dehydration. This happened in Denver, so who knows how long it has been spreading since before that. If all these people were going around spreading this unknowingly for AT LEAST a month before we went on lockdown, shouldn’t we be somewhat closer to heard immunity? Also this would mean the mortality rate is a LOT lower than anticipated.	My cousins just tested positive for the antibody test for an illness they had back in February.

Why do I have symptoms coming and going in waves (3 months later)?	I was sick in the beginning of May for about two weeks.

Any folks have their first, or maybe only, symptoms be gastrointestinal?	I’ve heard that gastrointestinal upset can be a symptom, but I’m wondering if that’s ever anyone’s first or maybe only symptoms? My boyfriend woke up with morning with severe stomach cramps the have quickly turned into diarrhea and vomiting. Even after vomiting and taking tums, he still is not feeling better. Obviously this could be something else, but it made me curious to ask, in case anyone else had the same experience. Thank you for your time!

Quarantine question	I (37F) tested positive 10 days ago and because I'm asymptomatic my quarantine ends tomorrow. My son (4M) and husband (35M) tested at the same time and were both negative, but were told to quarantine for 14 days due to close contact with me. We are between houses and staying at a hotel which has given this situation an extra layer of difficulty. The public health unit we have been in contact with told me we have to stay apart until their 14 days are up, which doesn't make sense to me because I'm not supposed to be contagious anymore, nor can I get reinfected so quickly. Anyone have any thoughts or first hand experience with this? Thanks!!	Quarantine question I (37F) tested positive 10 days ago and because I'm asymptomatic my quarantine ends tomorrow.

Still testing positive for IgG antibodies 5 months later - what does it mean?	Got sick in early April at the height of cases in the NY metro area. Low grade fever, body aches, minor nausea, horrible headache, and lost smell completely. I never took a PCR (nasal swab) during symptoms but tele-doctor said assume you have it. A couple weeks after recovering I took my first antibody test with Quest Diagnostics. It came back positive for IgG antibodies. Everyone I spoke too basically said it was a crap test and can’t be trusted. I figured why not get another test from another lab... fast forward 2 more weeks and I took a rapid antibody test from AyTu Labs. It came back instantly positive for IgG antibodies. Again - everyone said that was a crap test and can’t be trusted. So - I decided every month I will get an antibody test to see how long and how consistent they come back positive. I’ve now taken 3 more antibody tests (June/July/August) all through LabCorp - 2 were Abbott labs and 1 was DiaSorin ... all came back positive. Media says these antibodies will fade - my don’t seem to be fading.

She is a stubborn and proud woman who has tried to hide symptoms from me but I will document them the best I can. I hope this is helpful to someone. I have been reading things because I can't sleep.

Any parents here have a kid who has/had PMIS?	"By PMIS, I speak of the Kawasaki-like disease linked to Covid19 in children. Our 3.5 year old had a 103 fever for 3 days which finally broke yesterday. He also had some diarrhea which seems to have resolved. We were going to take him in today if the fever persisted but it did not and we thought we were out of the woods. The thing is, now he is presenting with a rash over most of his body which is also a symptom. His disposition is excellent right now though and he has not had any enlarged glands, conjuctivitis, or swelling. We were never confirmed to have Covid, we're in the ""maybe that was it"" crowd. The thing is, we've been locked down for 6 weeks so I have no idea where he'd get a different infection from. My question is this. Any parents of a kid with PMIS, did the fever stop at some point or was it and the other symptoms persistent? Did it come in waves like some experience with Covid? Thanks."

6 yo daughter COVID Positive	She was exposed by her daycare teacher so we tested her out of an abundance of caution. We got the positive test results back yesterday. She’s completely asymptomatic as of now (6 days from last exposure to positive case). We found out she was positive 5 days after her last exposure. My 2 year old was negative and my husband and I are waiting on our results. My kids are super close. Pediatrician has said to separate them and one parent quarantine with each. I’m really looking for someone who has had to do this, or didn’t do it and didn’t end up spreading it. Today was day 1 of quarantine and it was extremely difficult for us to all stay away from eachother. I don’t know if I can do it for 2+ weeks.	6 yo daughter COVID Positive She was exposed by her daycare teacher so we tested her out of an abundance of caution.

Feeling Funny	On the 31st of August I got tested for covid and the results came back negative after 5 days. But the following weekend I started to lose my appetite and feel nauseous and also feel very fatigued. The whole time I was also experiencing fall-time allergies so i chalked up all sneezing, itcy and runny nose and sometimes scratchy throat to that. Went in for a covid test the yesterday and now have to wait 10 days to hear back. I don't have a fever, my highest temp has been like 99 degrees right after I get done eating but it quickly lowers back down. I sometimes feel short of breath and dizzy when I stand up. Also get headaches which center around my sinuses mostly. I usually feel much better late at night too. Haven't had to use my inhaler for asthma yet this season. Weird stuff. This is maybe about a week into feeling this way? Might be just anxious, it sucks I have to wait 10 days tho to hear back.

I may have been exposed. What can I do to lessen it?

How long did it take you to recover?	I’m on day 19 since my first fever. The first 7 days I had fluctuating temps from 99-100. GI issues, felt crummy but not too bad. Day 10-13 I was short of breath and coughing. I’m currently minimally short of breath, coughing occasionally, mild chest aches. I’ve been fever free for about a week. However I’m still exhausted. How long did it take you guys to feel back to normal? I know everyone’s illness is different but looking to see what other people’s experiences have been like. I’m a nurse, my job is pressuring me to come back since I’m no longer having fevers, however I feel that if my chest aches and I’m coughing I’m still a risk to transmit to my patients.

67 year old father sick and won’t go to the doctor	Hi. My dad is 67 years old. He Is a former smoker. He quit about 6 years ago. He has high blood pressure that he takes medication for. And he has a bad back. Last Thursday, aug 21. He got sick with a low grade fever around 100, increased back pain(not sure if related), headache, night sweats, fatigue, and blocked sinuses. He had been to his doctor two days prior for a routine appointment. I live about 20 mins from him and my mom in a currently hard hit city. I had to pry the symptoms from both him and my mom through text and phone calls. I check in on him daily. It’s been 7 days now. The only improvement has been that last night he maintained a normal range temperature throughout the night. However, he woke up with a terrible headache and temp back up to 100.6. He won’t go to the doctor “since there is nothing they can do” and he doesn’t want my mom to be quarantined from her job. He said they can not afford that. They both don’t think it’s covid since he hasn’t lost smell or taste. They tried to claim he didn’t	67 year old father sick and won’t go to the doctor Hi. My dad is 67 years old.

Week 5 and still sick, but only having neurological symptoms	Initially I only suffered with body aches and fever, which went away quickly, and a few days later lost sense of smell and taste, which went on for weeks, but nothing else. A few days ago however, I started experiencing numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, in addition to an uncomfortable hot sentation in my spine. Sometimes I also have a bit of dizziness and lightheadedness, without headache. Just wondering if anyone out there with Covid has similar symptoms?

Acid reflux?	I started having symptoms around the 28th of last month, bad nausea, gas and feeling like I had to go the bath badly. Minor headaches occasionally that quickly went away. I got tested on the 3rd and still haven’t got my results. Most of my symptoms have seemed to go away, but r past few days I’ve been feeling like I have heart burn or acid reflux. When I drink a full glass of water I will end up feeling like I burp some water back up. If I have black tea it will be really bad. It’s kinda scaring me since I don’t normally have heart burn or acid reflux. Has anyone had these symptoms?	Acid reflux?

Help: TWO false negatives?	On 1st October I started with a temperature so isolated and booked a test. Symptoms then developed to include a coughing fits a couple of times a day, no appetite, reduced taste, fatigue, chest pains, breathlessness and a few other random symptoms like a face rash that came and went. This illness felt so weird and I was so sure it was covid. My test came back negative and I was advised to test again. 2nd test has also now come back negative but I'm still experiencing symptoms and still worried. My partner thinks that two negatives are a sure sign that I don't have the virus and he's probably right but does anyone have any experience of two negatives then being found positive?

Anyone else with mild/no symptoms having a hard time figuring out when to see people again post-infection?	I'm coming up on the end of my self-isolation period of 14 days and I feel a paralyzed about what to do as far as reintegrating into my pre-isolation routine. How do I know that I'm not going to spread the virus? I've had loss of smell and taste and a little dizziness, but never had a fever or chills (thankfully) so I'm having a hard time figuring out when to I can actually go see my friends again and stop barricading myself in my room (to protect the roomie). I know the CDC currently says 3 days post fever w no meds (doesn't apply) and 10 days since symptoms first appeared (I'm doing 14). I'm seeing mixed messaging about testing again: either yes, test and you need two negative results in a row; or no don't test b/c viral shedding may cause you to test positive even if it's dead viral matter. I've seen some advice to wait 2 days after symptoms subside, but does that count w anosmia, which I've seen can be pretty long-lasting? Anyone successfully reintegrate without spreading the virus?

Apologies if repetitive or in the wrong sub, but can someone who tested positive tell me if they had similar symptoms? Google research is telling me different things	I’m a 28 year old female, 5’6, 130lbs, physically fairly healthy, no asthma and not immune compromised thankfully. Current symptoms: Stomach cramps, bloating, nausea, shakes, chills, dizziness, but no fever according to my thermometer. Symptoms all started this afternoon and have continued and been getting worse for 10 hours now. I also usually fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down but I’ve been awake for three hours now. I can’t remember the last time this happened to me. I’m also a lesbian so no way I’m pregnant, and I’m on the pill to regulate my cycle, and I’m not even halfway through my cycle so it’s not PMS. The other thing is, I have moderate indoor and outdoor allergies as well so I always have a stuffy/runny nose, sore throat, and a mild cough (just started getting allergy shots so I can’t say for sure if those symptoms are due to potential covid or not). Does any of this sound familiar to any of you guys? What do you think?	Apologies if repetitive or in the wrong sub, but can someone who tested positive tell me if they had similar symptoms?

Should boyfriend (33m) go for 2nd opinion?	Just wondering if this warrants my boyfriend going for a 2nd opinion and if anyone’s experience matches his... Boyfriend developed a cough about 5 days ago, nothing major. As the week has progressed however it seems to have gotten worse. He’s been out of work so he’s been watching my daughter for me as I am still working (health care). Tuesday I came home and he said he was exhausted and had slept basically all day. That exhaustion has been on and off for days. He’s also gone between feeling hot and then having chills and feeling like he’s freezing. Last night he spiked a fever at 101.9°. He took some NyQuil and went to bed. I went to bed a few hours later and had found he had sweated through my sheets and comforter. At that point we decided he should go get tested. He just called me and said that they will not test him at his doctor’s office. They said for him to just assume he has it (with fever and cough she said it’s likely) and to monitor his symptoms for the next 72 hours. I’m very frustrated.

My mom refuses to get tested for covid even though she has multiple symptoms and works in healthcare. I’ve already had covid and I need to know if I’ve been exposed.	My mom (46F) is a healthcare worker who’s been fighting covid on the frontlines since the pandemic started. I (20F) spent the summer working for my university so I wasn’t home at all. A week into fall classes, I had to come home for reasons I don’t wanna specify. My mom was working at the time, but I was told by my university that I was allowed to travel and would just have to continue to fill out the daily covid check forms online. So I get home on Friday.

Should I Get a Test? Allergies vs COVID.	To start, my boyfriend (25M) and I (26F) have been in lockdown together since mid-March, with the exception of weekly drive up grocery pickups, and the odd drive up errand here and there. We have been having the occasional, appropriately distanced gatherings with two other friends that live in our same complex, both of whom have been doing the same lockdown practices as us. I have seasonal allergies, no medical conditions, and don’t take any medicine, other than Claritin. I wear a mask everywhere I go and wash my hands religiously. I work in retail and both of my stores have opened back up within the last week or so. One is in a mall, however we are only allowing 7-9 customers in the store at a time, have extensive cleanings between each customer, and are practicing appropriate distancing and mask requirements.

35M NYC - Mild Symptoms? Or something else?	Hey all, 35M based in NYC. Been having some possible symptoms the past week but wanted your thoughts on this. To preface, I’m usually not particularly prone to getting the flu. Coincidentally I did have a month long bout with the cold and quickly followed by a flu that went away early January. Before this past December, last time i had a flu (with fever/chills everything) was more than 10 years ago. Anyway, obviously with NYC being the epicenter of it all, i moved in with my girlfriend 3 weeks prior. Since we’ve been on lock down mode for the past 3 weeks, we’ve only gone out a handful of times to stock up on groceries (usually early in the morning to avoid crowding in grocery store) and we’d wear a mask and disposable gloves to avoid contact.

Or something else? Hey all, 35M based in NYC. Been having some possible symptoms the past week but wanted your thoughts on this. To preface, I’m usually not particularly prone to getting the flu. Coincidentally I did have a month long bout with the cold and quickly followed by a flu that went away early January. Before this past December, last time i had a flu (with fever/chills everything) was more than 10 years ago. Anyway, obviously with NYC being the epicenter of it all, i moved in with my girlfriend 3 weeks prior. Since we’ve been on lock down mode for the past 3 weeks, we’ve only gone out a handful of times to stock up on groceries (usually early in the morning to avoid crowding in grocery store) and we’d wear a mask and disposable gloves to avoid contact.

Is someone doing research on covid_19 symptoms that last for months?	I have been sick since early March. Symptoms come and go. I thought I was going crazy until I found this reddit. Yesterday I read an article on the Guardian from May 15th about a doctor that has exactly the same symptoms as me. That was also a relief in a way. The name of the article is “Weir as hell: the covid patients who have symptoms for months” Finally doctors are acknowledging what is happening to some of us. I wish they did some research. I would volunteer.	Is someone doing research on covid_19 symptoms that last for months? I have been sick since early March. Symptoms come and go.

If someone has no Primary Care Provider currently, who should or can they call for medical advice on how to handle Covid?	My dad has presumpted covid (waiting on test results), and I'm not sure who I can call for medical advice on how I should help or what we should do. He's just been drinking lots of fluids, eating some food, taking acetaminophen, and I bought him a humidifier to hopefully help. he's also developing gastro issues now like diarrhea He's been running a high grade fever of around 102-104 for the past few days, and I'm not sure what I can do	If someone has no Primary Care Provider currently, who should or can they call for medical advice on how to handle Covid?

Shortness of breath is giving me anxiety attack	I was diagnosed with corona virus last saturday. I guess it started at last thursday so this is my 9th day? maybe 8th i am not sure. First week was not that bad but this second week is getting worse. I had diarrhea, pain on my muscles, headache etc last week. They all vanished but i have shortness of breath this week. Cough increased too with this of course. It feels like i am not getting better but getting worse and this is triggering a lot of other mental problems with it. I am not gasping for air but when i inhale a big breath it triggers a little cough with it when i do it for the first time. No cough on the second big inhale. This triggers anxiety i guess because after these long breaths i forgot how to breathe, it feels like i have to control my breath or it wont be successful. I dont have any equipment to check my oxygen level etc. I am thinking about going to hospital but calling an ambulance feels wrong because i am not at the death's door for now.

Could these be (starting) symptoms of covid?	Hi everyone, Just asking for some advice... As a bit of background/story: my Dad is 62y/o and has high cholesterol. My mom is 60y/o cancer survivor with asthma. No allergies (hay fever etc) for either of them. My Dad never wears a mask/never social distances in shops or uses sanitiser- he’s under the impression that he won’t catch it, and that the whole thing isn’t that serious. My mom is the exact opposite- always wears a mask (even for a short walk) sanitises EVERYTHING. We all live together in a small 2 bedroom/1 bath house, so social distancing is non existent. Three nights ago my Dad began to get a runny nose and headache, this has only gotten worse over the past 2 day’s, he was half coughing (clearing his throat) all yesterday evening, and all day today he is sniffing constantly. My mom had started sniffing bad today and clearing her throat constantly. Yesterday I had a sore throat, but I gargled with salt water and it disappeared. It was back today though on a smaller scale- feels like something is lodged in it, towards the back.

Beginning Symptoms?	I have been feeling especially anxious about the virus lately. I’ve found that every minor headache I have or itch at my throat leaves me in a panic that I don’t really get out of for days. I don’t really know anyone who has had it so I have no one to ask. I’d really appreciate it if those who have experienced covid-19 would comment their early symptoms. When I look it up it basically just lists every symptom in the book which is unhelpful. Thank you all in advance &lt;3	Beginning Symptoms? I have been feeling especially anxious about the virus lately.

Heart Symptoms	Unfortunately I'm becoming a constant poster on here so I'm probably fueling my own anxiety but regardless - Week 7, Day Forever, and I feel as if in the past week alone I've developed heart related symptoms that are really making me nervous. The chest tightness I had last week has been getting better and worse like a roller coaster. My heart rate though is starting to worry me as well. Again, this week alone I've seen such a weird change, whereas the second I get up to do the smallest tasks, my heart rate shoots up to \~100 and takes a very long time to get back down. I guess more than anything else, I'm wondering if anybody has had these symptoms AND they have passed? I've gone through a battery of tests (urine, blood and chest xray) that have turned out very much fine, getting a CT Angiography in a little bit, so who knows. Is this my heart forever now or has anyone seen this come and go?

I’ve been nauseous all week, and my best friend may have COVID, could I have it?	My boyfriend(20 M) and I (20 F), as well as some our friends (all 20 yr old M&amp;F) went on a camping trip on July 3rd, we came back to our home town the following day. On July 5th, I left my friends house to go back to my boyfriends place where we both currently live. Since the 5th, I’ve been nauseous every day with no other symptoms. However, my best friend just got tested yesterday thinking she had strepthroat, but just to be safe got tested for covid too. Her symptoms have seemingly gotten worse too, she has a wicked fever (currently at 38°C), she’s got chills, she says when she breathes and swallows it feels as though daggers are in her throat. I’m scared for everyone’s safety, as most of them smoke and vape. Has anyone experienced symptoms similar to my friend who has been tested positive?

Question for drug users who made it through covid	Someone who isn't me has been feeling symptoms for a few days and is waiting for test results. He is doing ok but is worried about the impact that it might have on his heart/vascular system post recovery, specifically in regards to drug use. He was hoping maybe there are some other people here who live on that side of life who made it through and can enlighten him. With all the talk about heart attacks and strokes post-recovery in non-users SWIM really wanted to know if other people have been able to continue their usage without issue. He gets that 99% of people who see this question will have some snarky or critical answer but hopes that people will be respectful, everybody is just trying to live their lives.

Is it safe to quarantine with someone else who also tested positive?	The question is confusing but me and my boyfriend who live together tested positive and we believe we got it from work because there’s been a lot of people testing positive lately (we live in Texas).

Prob not as bad as I've ever been like in week one, but scared I'm going to trend downward. Can long timers give me insight into the second half of the teens, as far as how their journey went? Good, bad? Most long timers seem to get better in the 20s? guess I might set my sights there now, thinking day 18 for now. And yeah, for some reason day 14 really hurts. Obv the virus is being mean, but also I am so exhausted fighting this thing. I'm tired of being isolated and tired of being sick. Hope y'all are doing ok and doing your best, I know you are.

Tested positive today. How does this disease progress?	I along with a few members of my family have tested positive. I'm a 31M, my mother 70 and my aunties 68 and 65 have all tested positive but feel generally pretty good, mild symptoms, high temp, aches, headache and I alone seem to have a very mild cough and chest discomfort.

Was this it?	I remember getting a really bad flu late January into early February lasting about 8 days. I had a dry cough, some chest and muscle pain and lost some sense of smell but not taste. I assumed this was the flu and stayed home, but with the recent news that the virus was already spreading communally in California I am starting to believe that this could have been it, and about a week before I got sick I was traveling at the airport in Seattle. Is this similar to what it is and is it worth considering an antibody test?	Was this it? I remember getting a really bad flu late January into early February lasting about 8 days.

Fluctuating symptoms / intense anxiety	I’m on day 8 of symptoms, day 5 from positive test. I had the worst day so far yesterday - extremely congested, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and lightheaded. Today I felt almost 100% back to normal, I was energetic, active, no congestion, very minorly lightheaded. But then tonight, all of the symptoms from the previous day came back. I also have extreme health anxiety, diagnosed way before this all started but multiplied ten-fold since I was diagnosed. I’m just struggling quite hard with every little pain, twitch, etc that happens. Tonight I had a pain in my calf, and I just read earlier an article about COVID and an increased risk for blood clots. So now I’m overly anxious I have a blood clot. I guess I’m just looking for solidarity / advice / a virtual shoulder to lean on. Some days I deal with it quite well, other days like today I’m really a mess.	Fluctuating symptoms / intense anxiety I’m on day 8 of symptoms, day 5 from positive test.

Do I Need to Go to the Hospital? (Long Termer)	"Hey everyone, fellow long termer here (Day 77). So long story short (you can follow the rest of my story on my profile), I had a really good day two weekends ago (I mean jesus, I had forgotten how great it was to breathe easily again). I enjoyed it for a day or two, then Monday came around where I started to have the urge to clear my lungs out a bit with an intermittent light unproductive cough (they've come and gone since week 1). Still, I felt much better than I had been for weeks. Then Wednesday comes around and a storm hit my outdoor workplace, which causes us to run for shelter. That night, I felt a tiny pressure in the back of my back/lungs (possibly from an overextension from seeking shelter). The next day, I helped rebuild the job site that was damaged, which involved lifting two heavy barricades out of the way. I also spoke with colleagues for a whole 10 hour day, which has been taking a toll out of me recently. Jump to two days ago, where the pressure in my back is almost unbearable.

Only slight chest tightness/tender	About 4-5 days ago I was experiencing mild fatigue, then I had mild chest tightness continuing to today. I can breath fine and take deep breaths, but when I do that I feel the tightness. There’s a small amount of dull pain but I can still walk around and do moderately strenuous activity fine. My chest feels sort of tender to the touch. The tightness comes in waves, this morning when I woke up I didn’t feel it but it came back shortly after, and same later in the day. I have no other symptoms, no cough, fever, gastronomical issues nor nausea. Sometimes I feel like something is coming up my throat so could it be GERD? I was hoping it was just anxiety but this feels prevailing. I am feeling really anxious about this Has anyone who testing positive experienced only this? Getting a test tomorrow.

So he went to the doctor and they took his temp and that was normal so they did a Covid test and today it came back positive. So far he is feeling better than he did yesterday but still a little under the weather.

Cough	Good afternoon reddit, I tested positive yesterday with symptoms beginning two days ago. I had a rapid test done where results were available within a couple hours (essential worker). Anyways the first night was muscle aches, chills and a headache. Woke up next day same way so decided to get tested. Came out positive. I have now developed a scratchy throat, low grade fevers, fatigue and at times lung soreness. My biggest concern though is the cough. It’s one of those coughs where I can choose if I want to cough or not for the most part, I have never had an illness where a cough was developed so quickly. When I do cough it feels pretty unproductive, not satisfying and painful. At what point did your cough get worse? Should I be concerned? How do my symptoms sound? This would be day three for me. I am a 27yo male, who is prehypertensive. I like to exercise and I exercise daily.

I am a 27yo male, who is prehypertensive. I like to exercise and I exercise daily. I am not feeling lack of oxygen	2

COVID-19 antibody results	I had a bad case of COVID in July, and got an antibody test recently to gauge where my levels are after a few months. The provider sent the results in an email and didn’t give any context for what the result means. Have any of you received specific results with context? I have a result of 40.4, and have no idea if that’s low, medium or high. Google searches didn’t really help. Thanks for any insight you can offer!

Are these symptoms?	I’ve been feeling really cold since yesterday (especially cold feet’s and hand, but my chest and neck has been feeling warm). Went to the doctors office yesterday and they checked my temp and told me it was about 100F but when I came home and took my temperature again it was around 98.6. I started taking my temperature every few hours it’s been going up and down between 98.3-99.0. I’ve been having really bad cramps for the past few days maybe even more than a week ( I just got my period today, so maybe it could be that). I just recently had a lymph node on my neck which made my head hurt but it disappeared after a few days. And I’ve been coughing but it’s like I have a cough fit for about 1 minute and then it stops for a few hours. The cough started about a month ago and then stopped for a few weeks and then came back again. I’ve been monitoring my temperature and all the doctor wrote me was some amoxicillin and ibuprofen. I’m not sure if it’s just a cold or if I should go get tested. I haven’t been to work	Are these symptoms?

I've had it with ppl	I want to choose my words carefully. But I'm angry at how ppl are handling this. I stay in Texas. Down here it seems that ppl have an entitlement issue. They had a COVID party (no bullshit that's the theme)in San Antonio hosted by a positive person. My hometown is having multiple baseball games today. League games. My town has had 80 cases positive since July 1st. But they are out there crowded up, huddled together with no mask on despite the rising number if teens and kids in my town testing positive. They keep saying this is bullshit, it's a conspiracy to make us conform and this is just in my small town alone! I'm just frustrated because I was exposed at work and I'm trying everything I can to stay away from ppl.

I’m scared	Hi there! I’m a single mom with shitty health insurance and I have reached out to my doctor three different times over the last few weeks. I experienced all the typical symptoms early March but was never tested. I had a lingering cough and now it has progressed very fast since Saturday. I am currently not sleeping because I wake and can’t breathe. When I cough too hard I can’t breathe and I’m just confused as ever. I forgot my own age and simple things. I’m scared and I don’t have anyone to really talk to. Things are already hard with no work and providing for my son. Please send some positivity my way. I’m so scared because not only do I have some previous health conditions, my son has mild asthma and I don’t want to him get it.	I’m scared Hi there!

My COVID-19 experience Update	I'm about 16 days recovered and while my lung capacity feels back to normal I still have some lingering effects. Mainly fatigue and digestive issues. The digestive issues are odd because one BM will be a little loose and then I'll get constipated and can barely eek out a pebble the next time. I did have a normal one yesterday so i'm hoping that's over. The fatigue presents itself at the end of my day. I feel like i'm drained and I get super drowsy. I have to fight it to eat some dinner and do my bedtime routine. Once my head hits my pillow I am out. The oddest thing that I'm experiencing is a patch of numbness on the upper side of my left leg. I thought it was from the hospital bed and sitting for a long time as I dealt with the virus. It feels like it's going away, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Anyone else experiencing any of these after effects? Stay safe and heal up if you're recovering.

Can it possibly be Covid?	Since last Wednesday, I have been having daily fevers of around 37,5-38C, which usually come around evenings. Whenever I get fever, I have trouble breathing - my chest hurts, but I don’t really cough. I experience daily headaches and some muscle pain, especially in my back. Today my chest pain is even stronger and I have a fever of 37,5. I’m kinda hipochondriac and getting a test in my country is not that easy, especially when I still live with my parents, who do not want to test me, even though there are more and more cases everyday where I live.

Would you pay for weekly testing?	"While some government figures are optimistic about a vaccine will come early 2021, I believe that this will not be the case that we will be living with the virus a lot longer than we all expected. With this being said I live in NYC one of the hardest hit spots and while NY has been successfully recovering, a lot of states are seeing their first huge outbreaks or continuing to see a rise of positive tests and hospitalizations. &amp;#x200B; My wife is a RN in a nursing home and the state mandates that they all get tested twice a week. While that probably is a bit excessive I think getting tested at least once every week is very beneficial. Living in America where anything can be commercialized and healthcare plays a huge roll in all our lives, would you pay to be tested weekly? I personally have nothing to gain from this besides seeing what others think, but I would pay a monthly ""subscription"" or ""premium"", however you want to brand it to get tested every week by a professional. If so what would you pay? As someone who has COVID I can see myself paying anywhere from $100-$200"	"Would you pay for weekly testing?

Tested positive yesterday. I feel like I'm dying.	"31/8/20: felt like my throat is ""closing"", for a lack of a better term. 1/9/20: extreme shortness of breath; can't sleep, thought it was dyspnea or COPD since my dumb ass started smoking just a few days prior. booked a swab test the next day; chose at home and not on site because... obviously. 2/9/20: tested positive. I don't know what to do. I have these Vitamin C/Zinc tablets that I will take every 12 hours, so I guess that'll help. I couldn't sleep since the first symptom; and when I did, I always wake up 1 to 2 hours later, almost choking. I have a headache, and just today there's this coughing episode that's been repeating so continuously.

Covid revelation	In my sleep, I seriously had this thought. So many of us long-termers never had a cough or fever. We have dealt with lung pain and shortness of breath for months on end. When you cough you cough the virus up and out. Those of us who haven’t coughed have virus particles and debris stuck in our lungs (for months!) and were in a constant state of immune vigilance, hence the inflammation. My dad thinks he had covid but he coughed for a few weeks relentlessly and he didn’t have it more than 2 weeks. What do you all think?	Covid revelation In my sleep, I seriously had this thought.

Dad successfully extubated after 24 days on the ventilator!	Hello, I just wanted to give an update that my father was successfully extubated yesterday after 24 days on the ventilator! He is recovering strength now in ICU and breathing on his own with NC oxygen delivery! His kidneys are still not functioning properly, so he is continuing to receive dialysis, but we are just so happy and thankful that he is breathing and on his way to recovery! To everyone out there that is fighting this, or has a family member fighting: there is hope, no matter how long they are on the vent! We lost hope at times, there were good days and bad days full of hiccups. But the longer they are intubated, the stronger the more their lungs can recover and have a better chance to fight! Do not lose hope and God bless!	Dad successfully extubated after 24 days on the ventilator!

Lung tightness and burning flaring up at night?	I have not been tested due to my very mild symptoms. I had a low grade fever last Monday which was the first day I started to feel sick, and the fever hasn’t returned. I had a few days with headache, and one day that i had diarrhea in the morning. Besides that, it’s primarily been lung tightness and burning in the middle of my chest. I generally feel normal, and notice that my lung irritation flairs up primarily at night before bed. No extreme coughing at any point, just slight light coughs when my lungs feel irritated. I’ve spoken to my PCP, and they suspect I have it, but there’s not much they can do for me at this point. I feel fortunate that things haven’t gotten worse for me, and I’m on day 11 now of this lung irritation. Does anybody else notice their lungs flare up at night? And any suggestions on how to deal with this irritation? I find that it especially feels uncomfortable when I lay on my side.	Lung tightness and burning flaring up at night?

On July 4, my mom stayed in bed mostly feeling unwell with body aches with fever and some cough but has not gotten tested for COVID. My aunt who tested positive has had her kids come over since she showed symptoms since father's day (my parents think I was out of the line for telling them not to come back until test results came). My mom has felt better since with random coughing but today she had a fever. I haven't gone out in a month and have had a ongoing headache for the past three days and yesterday and today my throat feels tight and I cough or clear my throat with some phlegm but it isn't horrible. It doesn't hurt but last 3 days I have been stressed out and anxious about a calc test and other assignments on top of being skeptical of my parents and little cousins. I'm not sure if these are symptoms of COVID and not sure if it will worsen. I have allergies so it's hard to tell.

I tested positive for COVID-19 had no symptoms and tested negative for antibodies	I tested positive for covid-19 (at the end of august) and had no symptoms. I recently got tested for the antibodies (the end of September) and my results are negative. Is it possible I just had a false positive? I’ve done so much research but nothing on the internet says anything about people testing positive and testing negative for the antibodies. I called my doctor to get my results and she said that it was negative because I had no symptoms to begin with so my body had no reason to produce the antibodies to fight the infection. Has this happened to anyone else? Is corona a scam? I am so confused someone pls explain.

doctor is dismissing my symptoms	Hi reddit! so i (20 F) tested postive back in late june and was hospitalized for a few days because it was really bad (no other underlying conditions, completely healthy). it has now been a few months and all my symptoms are gone, no more chest pain or heart pain no residual cough. the only thing i have that has lasted since catching covid is this very unique head pain. i want to say its almost like a brain fog/brain zap kind of feeling. it almost feels as if there is a lot of pressure. it’ll randomly come out of no where and cause me to be in pain for hours. I never had this problem until I was diagnosed with covid. I told my primary doctor (basically had to push her to do a ct scan) and she finally complied but suggested that it is most likely muscular pain and that if there are no findings on the ct scan I should go see psychiatry because the “focusing” issue could be something else.....i mean i dont think anyone could be able to focus if their head feels like itll pop like a balloon...as a patient i just find it	doctor is dismissing my symptoms Hi reddit! so i (20 F) tested postive back in late june and was hospitalized for a few days because it was really bad (no other underlying conditions, completely healthy). it has now been a few months and all my symptoms are gone, no more chest pain or heart pain no residual cough. the only thing i have that has lasted since catching covid is this very unique head pain. i want to say its almost like a brain fog/brain zap kind of feeling. it almost feels as if there is a lot of pressure. it’ll randomly come out of no where and cause me to be in pain for hours.

Long hauler, 27F, sick since beginning of march, positive test in May, negative test in July, no pre-existing conditions, was sick for 2.5 months total, recovered fully for 6 weeks and then got really sick again from nowhere, still unsure if reinfection. Suffering in this current relapse (?) from the following: Extreme sensitivity to sound, waking up with congestion in ears and sinuses, vertigo, fullness in head, really erratic and strange heart rhythms on oximeter with really low and erratic oxygen levels from 85 to 90, chest tightness, sharp pains in chest when laying down, very low body temps 35.7 and also low grade fever 37.9, and lastly insomnia/waking up during sleep regularly, restless legs. Any advice/thoughts of what could still be the problem or what I should be trying to check if I go private? I had basically fully recovered for a significant period but now I just feel sick again. Completely unsure who to see, and what to say to the doctors as they're so dismissive, and I just feel like something is really wrong this time.

On day 11... Timeline of symptoms	Me: 27M, overweight, otherwise no pre existing conditions. EMT/dispatcher in MA, live in NH. Day 1 - Fatigue. Worked a 16 hour shift and just figured it was not getting enough sleep or whatever. Day 2 - Scratchy throat. Didn’t think anything of it. Still felt tired at points. Day 3 - Fatigue came back. Worked a shift til 11pm and had another one at 7am the next day. Day 4 - Woke up with a fever. Nothing measured on thermometer but I question it’s accuracy. On and off feelings of fever, fatigue, and chills. Now waking up every hour or so at night. Day 5 - Diarrhea first thing in the morning. Otherwise the same symptoms as yesterday. Day 6 - Worst day yet. Felt extra fatigued all day. Had AM diarrhea again and the on and off feverish feeling kept coming back. Day 7 - Felt like I was getting better. Still had AM runs but otherwise I felt alright. No appetite. Still slept like shit that night. Also noticed little pains when I take a deep breath. Day 8 - Woke up with the runs yet again. But still felt alright! Ended up getting tested in Shrewsbury.	On day 11... Timeline of symptoms Me: 27M, overweight, otherwise no pre existing conditions. EMT/dispatcher in MA, live in NH.

My story - long read, no structure, and bad language	37/male/6 feet 220lbs (now 205)/no major diagnosed pre-existing conditions/rarely get sick/southeast Virginia I believe on or about 3.13.2020 I contracted covid. I was hit with minor symptoms on 3.17.2020. This included scratchy throat and shortness of breath. On 3.22.2020 I developed more symptoms. By 3.24.2020 it was worse and by 3.27.2020 I could no longer work from home.

35 year old smoker with a fever. Tested today but results in 3-7 days. I'm terrified.	"I'm hoping it's not covid. I have since everything I could. Mask everywhere. Sanitize. Wash hands repeatedly... but then two of my coworkers were sick and came to work anyway. Customers occasionally not wearing masks. I had a headache yesterday. I told myself it was the weather. I had a light sore throat a few days before. ""From breathing through my mouth with the mask on"", I convinced myself. Now a 99.4 fever. I got tested today at a local national guard event just because my coworkers were sick. I feel fine. But thought I felt warm, even though it's a hot day. So I took my temperature. Now I'm petrified. I live with my 62 and 65 year old parents. I have distanced in the house and cleaned surfaces, but I make the dinners. I clean. What now?

Could I have had covid?	I have a story here, and I’m almost convinced my family had covid in February. Here’s why. A little background. We live in a large city in the Midwest, so exposure could have been possible. We also had traveled within the country but still traveled about 2-4 weeks before I got ill. End of January I got extremely ill, I was around 15 weeks pregnant at the time (currently 32 weeks pregnant) and I got what I thought was the flu. Started out sort of slow, sore throat and a feeling like I couldn’t breath. By the next day I had shortness of breath, dry cough, lost my sense of taste, and extreme fatigue. Days 3-14 looked like that with an accompanied loss of smell, fever, body aches. Etc.. I went to urgent care sometime in that time frame and tested negative for flu and strep. I was diagnosed with upper respiratory infection. Days 14-21 I then got a stopped up nose, still had a cough, sense of taste came back, sense of smell came back, fever left, body aches left, etc. still more tired than usual but chalked that up to pregnancy.

My mom just beat stage 0 cancer	I’m not really worried about myself or my boyfriend. We’re relatively healthy and could easily fight it off. I am worried about my mom. She just beat stage 0 breast cancer and was (is?) on meds for MRSA. We are in the green phase but she still wears a mask whenever she goes out. Her county has 16 cases and 1 death, and my county has 30 cases and 2. She’s a very hygienic person. Should I be extremely worried about her?

My employer is choosing to stay open regardless of my positive case.	Apparently he’s told my other coworkers that the CDC will track down my contacts and let us know what to do from there in our office, and then test all my contacts. Well, it has to be BS right? Or am I missing something? From what my doctor told me, it’s my responsibility to notify those I’ve been around with which I did. He didn’t say anything about testing everyone I’ve been in contact with. And I don’t blame them, considering those WITH known symptoms can’t even get a test. I told my coworker maybe she can get a test if she tells her care doctor she’s been directly exposed. Nope, denied. Says if she didn’t have symptoms then she’s okay now. I can’t imagine being on the CDC’s radar haha! I’m sure the local health department gets notified but nobody said anything about releasing my records? How do you know my contacts if nobody even asked me for them? My positive phone call basically just asked me for my symptoms, how I’m feeling, telling me it’s mild, and to wait to recover at home.

1 month in and oxygen hasn't improved since hospitalization	"My uncle was hospitalized for a few days 2 weeks after testing positive. It's been 12 days since he was sent home and his oxygen hasn't improved from 93%. He was given oxygen to use at home ""as needed"". All his symptoms are gone except an occasional cough and SOB that comes with physical activity.

Tested Positive 14 October	Hey everyone, I'm a 16 year old male who just got informed they are positive for Covid 19 after having myself tested 2 days prior. I thought it would be useful for some people out there to hear my experiences and thoughts so here they are. Saturday 10/10: feeling a bit tired and groggy, no real complaints, went to work as usual Sunday 11/10: woke up with a severe headache after sleeping 11 hours (headache felt like one you get after sleeping that long). Towards the evening I started getting chills and decided to check if I had a fever. Temps were around 37°c so nothing too concerning. Decided to get tested nevertheless. During the night my temperatures rose to 37.5. Monday: woke up with 36.8° temps, had mild headache but no real complaints, went to get tested in the afternoon and by the time I returned home I felt completely fine Tuesday: again a mild headache, no new symptoms Wednesday (today): mild headache continues, nose slightly blocked but otherwise feeling fine. My family is showing mild symptoms (both parents over 45) but seem to have even milder complaints than that of my own.

Turns out, not allergies	I've been occasionally checking my temp, and August 10th I noticed it was slightly elevated. Like 99.1 F. By no means a fever, but I figured I'd keep an eye on it. August 12th, I was very tired and went to bed early at like 8pm. But I also have a 10 month old who is exhausting so I didn't think too much of it. August 17th my allergies had been acting up, but I wasn't sure what was blooming. Nothing severe, didn't even need to blow my nose, just felt itchy and some sinus pressure. This evening, I had a worse reaction and was sneezing a lot. Netipot and a benedryl worked so I figured it was from using a blanket my cat had slept on. August 19th I finally decided to call the doctor to get their advice on this not-a-fever that would come and go. Since I measured between 99.1 and 99.6 five times in the past week, I just found it too weird. They said get tested just in case, so i did. At the test my temp was 98.4. It never rose again.

Question regarding tingling and numbness sensation	I’m awaiting the results of my test at urgent care on 4th of July. Currently self quarantining and pretty anxious. Main issue I’m experiencing is fatigue (comes and goes) and a weird sensation all over my body.

Has anyone else experienced this as a symptom of COVID-19? No fever, no headache, sometimes cough, sore throat, and sneezing, but pretty minimal. The overall weird feeling is totally freaking me out.

Anyone else have a consistent sore throat for a month?	I haven't been tested yet. I'm currently on a second round of antibiotics. I'm just trying to do my research and see if I've been possibly taking these antibiotics for nothing and it could possibly be covid. Other symptoms include chest tightness/pain and headaches, which both could also be explained by other factors. The main thing is I've had an inflamed throat and a throat ulcer for a month now. I've recently gotten in contact with an ENT - who prescribed the most recent round of antibiotics. If my throat doesn't improve by Monday I'm going to ask for a covid test along with anything else to make sure it's not something more serious.	Anyone else have a consistent sore throat for a month?

COVID Symptoms for only 2 day???	Hello all, I have a unique situation so I figure I'd share to see if anyone else had a similar scenario.

On 7/7- around noon, I was WFH and I started to get a little dizzy and lightheaded, didnt think too much about it. I progressively felt worse and by the early afternoon I had a full on headache, pain behind my eyes, coughing with mucus and a low-grade fever of 99.5-99.9. At this point I just assumed that I caught the virus either in New Orleans or while I was traveling. Had some trouble sleeping as my body was hot but overall it felt like a bad cold.

If you are an essential worker, what are your employers doing once you notify them that you tested positive?	"My husband is an essential worker at a charter school (he's a custodian). They're making him paint the whole campus while other staff members get to work from home. He felt sick on 7/8 and called out on 7/9-7/10. He went and got tested on 7/9. On 7/11, he tested positive.

How can I protect myself in a studio apartment from someone who just came off a intercontinental flight?	My dad is flying from the Middle East to the US next week, which is practically 24 hour ordeal spanning three different airports and two planes. He's in his late sixties so we agreed that it's probably not safe to expose him to further risk by putting him in a hotel. He's coming to my apartment for one night before driving to our home in a different state, where he'll quarantine for two weeks. I'm a little anxious about his stay here but I won't ask him to stay in a hotel because he's (65/M) is way more at risk than I am (25/F). I'm hoping he'll be fine but, worst case scenario, I just wanted to know if there a way to minimize the risk to myself during the night he's here? My studio is spacious. There's a 'bedroom' area that's partitioned off by a wall, but is otherwise exposed to the rest of the apartment. There's one bedroom and one little window I can pop open if it's not too hot that night. I'm going to keep a mask on but it's not a N95.

How did this start for you? I’m being presumed positive while waiting for testing and I’m curious.	Not a lot of scientific info out there, and since I’m immunocompromised (on chemo for an autoimmune disorder, multiple pre existing conditions) it’s especially hard to differentiate. This is what I’ve been experiencing, how does it line up with you? I developed a low grade fever last week on Tuesday (99.7 F), some chills, not a big deal. Woke up that night with an intensely itchy throat, had a coughing fit, went back to sleep. Was still dealing w the itchy throat when I woke up but it went away. I had a few coughing fits that day, nothing exciting and nothing I thought anything of. The next night, I had stomach pains that woke me up and diarrhea the next day that resolved on its own. Coughing gradually got worse over the next few days, and the fever starting fluctuating from 99.8-101 throughout the day. As of today (week post first fever, Wednesday) I have a fever of about 100, chills, and tightness/burning in my chest, some shortness of breath, I feel generally lightheaded and dizzy, and I’m a bit more fatigued than usual.

Update on the speech issues I’ve developed..	I made a post last week asking if any other recovered people were having neurological issues after recovering. I’m on my phone and I’m not messing with trying to post the link with it. Long story not so short: I’m having issues when speaking, I forget a word and when I try and recall it, my mind blanks and I freeze. I’ve also had bouts of ‘returning’ covid symptoms. I’ll get a cough and have difficulty breathing for a couple days. I went to my PCP today to get checked out. I had a curve ball thrown at me last week though. Wednesday of last week, I found a tick attached to my back. I didn’t think much of it after I pulled it off and went about my life. The bite has since developed a red circle around it and I woke up Sunday with horrible muscle soreness in my upper back muscles with neck stiffness. I had a temp of 99.9 and my wbc was elevated. So, labs to test for Lyme and Colorado tick fever were ordered. But wait! There’s more!

Antibody test negative. What gives? Was it in my head?	Hi there. I started suffering from Covid like symptoms at the beginning of April and had a zoom appointment with my doctor, and was diagnosed with likely Covid19. And I have to say, it was the roughest illness I have ever had and I was considering going to the ER more than once because I was so short of breath that I was getting very dizzy and I was afraid of suffocating in my sleep. While I never did develop a fever, my other symptoms included - very dry cough that still lingers to this day, was so bad that I had to use an inhaler - gastrointestinal distress, food and drink that I used to have no issue with gave me, well, distress - extreme fatigue on the worst days, I slept like 16 hours one day, but that could have been the z-pac I started taking - chest tightness and pressure, like someone was sitting on my chest and I could not take a full breath - lower back pain - headache - swollen lymph nodes I was sure I had it. I haven’t had to use an inhaler since I was a kid and had severe asthma.	Antibody test negative. What gives? Was it in my head? Hi there.

Thinking I’m possibly positive, anyone else relate to these symptoms?	6 days ago a bastard of a human being coughed in my direction at the grocery store. I had on my mask, but I’m sure it held no protection over me. On Saturday evening I had a random sniffly nose that went away like an hour later. Then fast forward to yesterday evening I started feeling a little SOB but it was soothed by tea and I was able to sleep. I am feeling slight SOB today and some minor chest pressure.

Headache + Fatigue	I manage at a store in the mall and I had an employee test positive 7/23. I worked with her 7/19 and unfortunately we made the decision to not wear our masks after the store closed because of the heat. I wasn’t ever within super close proximity for an extended time but we were still massless around each other. Her only symptoms were a fever that lasted a few days and loss of taste and smell. I then had another employee call off 7/29 because of a sore throat and loss of taste and smell. She got tested yesterday and will get results in 3-6 days, but based on her symptoms were assuming she will be positive. I was tested on Tuesday 7/28 out of an abundance of caution and won’t have my results for another 2-5 business days. I’ve had a headache since Monday that’s very mild, as well as pretty bad fatigue. I’ve had a sore throat on and off but I think it’s from allergies. Has anyone tested positive and only had a headache and fatigue?

Before the general panic and the ddclared state of emergency, i'm fairly certain i have gotten it but they wouldn't test me because i didn't know anyone who had traveled to china lol. But at my job i am in contact with a lot of people. I had basically all of the symptoms. First it was a simple dry cough and fatigue. Then, it was an intense dry cough that was extremely painful with fever, for a couple days, breathing was painful in my lungs. I was bed bound for days. I had constant headaches. Diarhea. I had completely lost my sense of smell and taste even after all the other symptoms had gone away. I thought i had lost it forever. Now, if that's indeed what i've got which i know i will never ever know, but let's pretend. I	0
Symptoms	Did anyone experience like an itch in the back of their throat but never coughed? I have a headache, no sore throat(some mucus) but no cough or other symptoms. I’m a hypochondriac and am nervous.	Symptoms Did anyone experience like an itch in the back of their throat but never coughed?

Possible case in January?	During the last week in January, I was experienced fatigue for an entire week. I felt light-headed during the day. After a week, my throat started feeling funny and started to swell. I had no cold, no cough, no runny nose. I had slight fever and headaches. This was a few weeks after returning to college after break and many people were sick with throat issues. I tested positive for strep at the health center but feel like it was really strange that I felt fatigued for an entire week before the throat pain started. Also, I rarely get sick so getting strep was odd for me. Is it possible this could’ve been covid? I’m thinking of getting an antibodies test but feel like it’s a stretch to be hopeful since it was so early in the year. Is there anyone who thinks they got it so early on who tested positive for antibodies?	Possible case in January? During the last week in January, I was experienced fatigue for an entire week.

I’ve been having point/ pokey pain in my chest?	I *may* have had exposure 2-3 days ago. Could this be a precursor to covid or something else? Edit: it’s not constant. It comes and goes. Till now, it doesn’t happen when I take deep breaths. By that I mean, I don’t think it’s linked to my breathing.	I’ve been having point/ pokey pain in my chest?

Do you recover faster in the hospital?	Hi, my father went to the hospital last weekend due to COVID but was only there for a night, thinking he could recover at home fine. A week goes by and he has no symptoms besides fever/loss of taste+smell/major fatigue. Noticed his breathing began to become heavy, bought a pulse odometer and realized his O levels were reading 85-90%. We took him to the hospital yesterday and the doctors say he has bilateral pneumonia, has anyone experienced this? Also, can I become hopeful for his recovery now that he is at a hospital with trained medical professionals? Any information is helpful during this super scary + stressful time. He also has no underlying conditions and is pretty healthy for his age	Do you recover faster in the hospital?

Timeline for returning to work	So I first experienced symptoms on the 12th (fatigue) and tested positive on the 15th after having a 101 fever on the 14th. Fever eventually subsided and so did the sneezing and body aches. This is my first day without any stuffy nose or any other symptoms with the exception of two little things that I don’t know quite what to make of. I get random tickles in my throat and have to cough but they’re very dry, “unenthusiastic” coughs for lack of a better word. My taste also isn’t back 100%, salty foods taste too salty and make me feel strange, almost nauseous. I was wondering if I have to wait for these symptoms to completely vanish before I return to work or if these are just residual symptoms of the virus. Thanks in advance!

"Okay I just want to help out for my fellow ""Do I really have the virus or not?"" folks."	Im a foreign student studying in the UK. Since the UK went into lockdown, I've self isolated myself and only had deliveries and such. Never went out once. Everything felt fine until one day suddenly I get a sore throat. Gargled some saltwater and it went away. Again I get it the next day, took some paracetamol cuz apparently ibuprofen does jack shit against this virus. At this point I'm suspecting something but not fully convinced. Then I fucked up... To catch up with Uni work I invited my friend over (who was and is fine btw) and we sat down across the table and did some work. The next day was particularly beautiful so I went for a jog and did some light exercises in the park. Then it started happening. My chest felt tight. I couldn't breathe. Sore throat. At this point I'm panicking. Holy shit, do I have the virus? How did I catch it? When did I catch it? I had a nasty flu back in February. All of the symptoms matched Covid-19 but my GP told me it wasn't the virus. Again the cases were much lower back then in the UK.

Waiting on test after exposure	"My partner and I were potentially exposed last weekend. We were tubing down our local river, which we assumed would be fine because it's outdoors and there is plenty of space. One part of the river gets very narrow, and had a sandbar crowded with people, none of whom wore masks. We stayed as far away as possible, but a few drunk maskless people did get very close (on purpose, making fun of us).

Occular Migraine?	Has anyone experienced this with the virus? I started feeling nauseas about an hour ago. Nothing major, though nausea has not been one of my symptoms. A few minutes ago I developed an occular migraine. I have experienced it a couple of times in my past, though it usually looks like a big colourful flashing carousel. This time it's just one little teardrop shaped point, right in the centre of my vision and is only happening with my left eye. This is freaking me out. It's not a stroke or eye damage suddenly happening, is it? I'm on day 54, tested negative by throat swab on day 38. Still experiencing SOB, fatigue, racing heart rate, some bloating in my abdomen. The nausea feels kind of like hunger pangs and is mostly situated in my upper midriff.	Occular Migraine? Has anyone experienced this with the virus? I started feeling nauseas about an hour ago.

Day 75 and I’m finally feeling like myself. Hang in there !!!	I assume I was exposed on 3/28 at work from a + patient on the covid unit I work on. Tested + 4/3. To say the last 75 days have been a slow frustrating recovery is an understatement. My primary symptom was severe diarrhea, nausea and fatigue. Right after my 14 day quarantine I developed severe shortness of breathe and chest pain. I was terrified. It was so scary but i kept track of my pulse Ox, which never went below 95%. Chest x ray was normal. After 2 weeks of SOB/CP, the diarrhea and nausea returned and remained the rest of the time. I’m still having diarrhea but it’s usually once a day compared to the 10+ times a day I previously had. Blood work 2 weeks ago showed dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, but my inflammation markers were normal and ANA ( auto immune ) was negative. Everything I was feeling was from the virus, there wasn’t anything else causing it. I also tested + for antibodies.

What if a number of people independently figured out there is a better solution to treating COVID-19? Would you have benefitted based on description?	I am a chemical engineer not a doctor. High risk. I began processing information about reports of people who recovered, from Reddit and all around the world. I became convinced I was right. I amassed some medical equipment in my house to self-treat. I as well predicted they would find out ventilators are not good solution. The key is stop the virus in your body way before you get to that point. I am pretty sure they’ve figured this out the problem with using ventilators by now. I ran this alternate solution by my doctor and he said that if I felt that strongly about it, I am ethically required to release the information to the world. I agreed but of course, would have to get Fauci and CDC on board first. I don’t agree to post something against CDC guidelines. My strength lies in solutions not project management so I need someone to basically take over that part. Of course it needs doctor review. As well it could be implemented in most countries.

Any suggestions how to improve symptoms?	Two weeks ago, my friend (not a redditor), began having symptoms. It started with a migraine, which progressed to a high temp and then vomiting for several days. After vomiting for around 5 days I finally convinced her to go to the hospital. They tested her and did blood tests. She tested positive and her blood doesn’t show signs of dehydration. I read on this sub someone said that it’s recommended to sleep sitting up so fluid doesn’t get caught in your lungs and can help avoid pneumonia. Are there any other suggestions to help symptoms and also avoid virus getting worse?	Any suggestions how to improve symptoms? Two weeks ago, my friend (not a redditor), began having symptoms.

Acne sufferers - have you noticed changes in your acne with COVID?	Long hauler here, around day 90 or so. I have always had mild to moderate adult acne on my face, but ever since I got corona my acne disappeared 100% from my face. Instead, mild acne is now on my chest, which I rarely got in the past. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced similar changes to their acne, like completely disappearing and /or shifting from one area to another? I am thinking G.I. issues are the cause of this since there is a connection to the gut and acne. It seems my gut has been completely out of whack since corona and has probably affected acne. If my theory is right, when/if I get 100% over my corona symptoms, and my body has returned to normal in all functions, acne should re-appear on my face. I never thought I'd say this, but for once I am looking forward to seeing acne on my face as it will mean things are that closer to being normal again.

A few concerns	I tested positive around 4 days ago. 2 days after being positive I started having flu-like symptoms. The past couple of days have been the worse. Overall, I just haven’t been feeling well. I’ve had a trip planned (nature trip) all summer now, and it’s going to be on August 8th which is 11 days since my positive test, 10 since symptoms... Would it still be safe to travel with a few friends? Also my sense of smell has started to sort of diminish should I be concerned? Is this permanent?

Anyone else with red swollen toes/feet and skin rashes during their illness combined with feber and dry cough?	So, I have documented all of my symptoms during my illness. I'm not tested since my country only tests people who are hospitalized. I've been sick for 4-5 weeks now and have had all the classical symptoms which come in waves. Sometimes I feel good, sometimes I feel absolutely shit. My symptoms are a dry cough, low grade fevers (rarely higher than 38/100), shortness of breath, lung pain, back pains, body aches, head aches and red swollen eyes. I've also had swollen sinuses but without a runny nose. I've had a tingling scratchy feeling in my throat but it has not been sore like I usually get from a cold. However, one of the more puzzling symptoms I've had are skin rashes on my arms, legs, chest and back. They look like urtikaria and are red and warm. I've also had red swollen toes for a couple of weeks. The redness seems to have disappeared now. Here's a pic of it. https://imgur.com/a/GI5U7HS Anyone else with this symptom? Thoughts?

I am on Day 5 and it's getting fucked up. Presumed positive.	I am 28, male (heavy smoker and No Pre Existing conditions).

Roommate tested positive, asymptomatic. How likely is it that I have it?	Roommate tested positive on Friday and is quarantining elsewhere. She isn't experiencing symptoms, but her father tested positive on Monday and he has a mild/moderate case. I hadn't seen much of her, but we live in a small apartment.

Should I still isolate for two weeks having been directly exposed even if I receive a negative result? Thanks.	Roommate tested positive, asymptomatic. How likely is it that I have it? Roommate tested positive on Friday and is quarantining elsewhere. She isn't experiencing symptoms, but her father tested positive on Monday and he has a mild/moderate case. I hadn't seen much of her, but we live in a small apartment. I got tested yesterday and am waiting the results.

False negative?	I heard that 30% of the tests are false negatives and my mom tested back negative but her symptoms are aches, headache, and a little cough. Should she still self isolate??

Convinced I had COVID-19 in January/February	"To preface I worked in Las Vegas in a super busy hotel at the time, I was always worked to death and always seemed to work the late shift pretty much by myself seeing tons of guests in and out. I was weak in my leg, sweating with a fever (I remember taking my temp at home and it was 102 for a few days), and I had a horrible HORRIBLE dry cough that didn't leave me until I swear almost April...I was short of breath and couldn't even walk to the tables that weren't that far away without needing to get a drink or sit down and I had never felt that sick before in my life! To this day I still feel short of breath if I do too much. I know it was possibly ""too early"" since we didn't really go on lockdown until almost mid-March. It sucked because this was the life I knew, not being able to go home sick because I was the only one there. I hope these days are of the past.

Need to vent. Feel like a leper	I work in education. Around mid August schools will open and I will be back at work. I think most likely the health department will give me the clear to go back but I am not sure. I have not told coworkers about it.

Guess I'm lucky.	I tested positive on the second of August, and so far nothing to report. Going back to work on the 19th, which I'm happy as hell about. No symptoms, fever, cough. I work in health care, and was told that they will be conducting mandatory weekly testing. My son's 9th birthday is coming up, and I cannot afford to be broke and not make his day happy. Anyhow, if anyone wants me to keep them updated about the weekly testing, I will. If I test positive again, it's another 10 days of no work, no money and I don't even have permanent residence at this point other than my car. Wish you all the best!!!	Guess I'm lucky.

Quarantine	Myself and my 14mo just tested postive after being exposed to a coworker at the daycare I work at. Brother and Husband are getting tested on Saturday, that was the soonest we could get them in. Neither of us have any symptoms yet, so being positive has just been mindblowing. Kinda frustrated because coworker had been showing symptoms around the 24th, and continued going to work until the following week, and my job was shutdown the 30th. So now we are all out of work, and I might not be allowed to return until November 1st.	Quarantine Myself and my 14mo just tested postive after being exposed to a coworker at the daycare I work at.

My unusual experience with COVID19. Please get tested even if you are showing no symptoms!	I got my first test done on 20th May even though I had no symptoms due to an office formality. My results didn't come for i don’t know what reason and I got tested again on the 1st June. The hospital told me I was positive in both the tests which was a huge shock for me since I was absolutely sure I didn’t have it. I think I got it from my work since few of my co-workers were also positive at the same time as me but we were all maintaining very strict rules given by the government. The only symptom which I had was that after a few days of my first test I couldn't smell and taste for about 5 days. I was not convinced I had coronavirus since this was my only symptom. I do still live in my home with my family and I was feeling really worried that I could have transmitted the virus to them all and especially my dad who is a diabetes patient.

Is covid getting weaker or....	So I’ve posted here few times before I got my results. I’ve basically just been having sore throat and minor chest pressure. Today is day 10 and only thing left is mucus stuck in throat making me want to clear my throat. However, no one in my family (besides my mom, she just has the throat feeling as I do) is sick. My bf got kinda sick on August 3, but he’s basically “recovered” now. His family has diabetes and they still haven’t seem to get sick. What is the issue with this virus? Did I yield a false positive or is the coronavirus just getting super weak?	Is covid getting weaker or.... So I’ve posted here few times before I got my results.

Am I the a*hole for not doing my third test?	"I test positive back in August, with the start of the symptoms on 10th. I stayed at home for nearly 5 weeks now, after I tested positive again, on the second test, although I didn't have symptoms at all and haven't had them since late August, but I understood that the virus, even though dead, may still linger in your body. Now, don't get me wrong, I want to make sure it is safe for everyone to return back to the apartment, but as it happened with the second test, might happen with this one as well, and I can't afford either the test or the quarantine, since I need to go back to work now. What do you think, is it safe to go out in the world again, without being worried I spread the germs? (I know the question might sound stupid, but as there is no clear answer yet for how many days after the first infection started you can be presumed ""uninfected"" or ""noncontagious""... I wanted a second opinion from this group.)"	"Am I the a*hole for not doing my third test? I test positive back in August, with the start of the symptoms on 10th.

Sore Throat-- Do I have COVID or am I just freaking out??	"So yesterday I developed a sore throat in the midafternoon towards the evening; it started as a slight irritation in my tonsil area then kind of got a bit ""bigger,"" took up slightly more of my throat. I went to sleep, woke up today, and my throat was absolutely fine, not even slightly sore or dry. It lasted maybe 6-8 hours start to end. I even called my local COVID call center and spoke to someone; they told me it's likely that I have some sort of nasal thing / a reaction to the changing weather/blooming plants, which makes sense. Typically I develop cold-like symptoms when the seasons change. Since the soreness in my throat went away, I haven't felt any weirdness or anything like that; no muscle pain or fatigue. I went for about a mile's walk today with no shortness of breath or anything like that. But right now I feel a strange sensation in the back of my throat--not pain, not even really discomfort; it feels like I have to cough, but I haven't been coughing--or at least, my body hasn't been ""forcing"" me to cough / no coughing spells.

Worried sick about my grandparents	My cousin tested positive for Covid-19. He was sent home from work on Monday, and I have no idea what day he is on. He has a low-grade fever and just lost his sense of taste. His mother/my aunt was around my grandparents about 8 days ago. She has been around my cousin, but she's not showing symptoms. I'm afraid she has it and doesn't know it yet, and that she exposed my grandparents. I'm so worried and stressed out. I feel absolutely helpless. I guess I can only wait and see what happens, but at least from what the news says, it seems like Covid would be a death sentence for my grandparents. Is it possible that my grandparents could catch Covid from being around my aunt? Does the timeline add up?	Worried sick about my grandparents My cousin tested positive for Covid-19.

COVID Recovery - Ongoing issues with exertion?	I am feeling slight fatigue three months post-COVID diagnosis. It's definitely lingering but I am lucky that it isn't severely impacting my day-to-day life. I am experiencing a similar issue that I am having a hard time finding any medical or scientific reporting on (probably because the search terms are pretty similar to the generic 'fatigue' question) and I am curious if others have had this experience or if anyone has read anything about this phenomenon. I have begun re-introducing working out into my daily life since COVID over the last month. Prior to this, I was able to go on pretty long (5+ mile walks) and do short bike rides (under 2 miles) without issue, but neither of those activities really get the heart rate up and it was always very casual activity. Anyway, I have done three 'intense' HIIT workouts over the last three weeks. After each workout, I am fatigued to the point of exhaustion and I have chest tightness like I did during COVID for about 24 hours after the workout.

Is it possible covid19 is a mutation of FCov?	I noticed there is a ton of similarities between FCov and covid-19, symptoms, treatments that were tried to beat FIP in cats (hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir) the fact that many of the felines can be asymptomatic, young kittens seem to less affected by FCov where as in mature cats it can turn into a recurrence of FIP. The fact that the tiger was not immune to covid19 I am not a biologist but I did see covid19 and FCov have a very similar nucleotide lenght. If the jump from the virus came from cats at a wet market instead of bats could we use what's known about FCov and FIP to use towards covid19. The symptoms of FIP are so striking similar and also the extreme difficulty with detecting FIP in cats due to false negatives or false positives. Thanks for reading this hope for a speedy recovery to those infected and those with loved ones infected. Jeremy	Is it possible covid19 is a mutation of FCov?

My wife and roommate tested positive, but I tested negative. Why?	I dont get it. I was put into the hospital earlier this week for suspicion of having Covid19, and first off let me tell you all the symptoms were there except fever. Not once did I have a fever. Oh, and our room mate was a confirmed case. However, each time I was tested(3 times in 24 hours) though the test came back negative. I was treated and released back home where I learned that my wife had also tested positive for Covid19. Both of their doctors think that I had it and passed it to them(I was symptomatic a few days before them) but they have no idea why I would test negative that many times. The hospital tested me that many times to rule out false negative before they even considered releasing me. Does this sound right at all? Do I need to get retested? For the record we are all asymptomatic now and all feel much better.	My wife and roommate tested positive, but I tested negative. Why? I dont get it.

Post COVID recovery - depressed, fatigued (TW)	Hi, I got sick mid March and had multiple relapses, including pneumonia. I was not hospitalized but it took forever to recover. I didn't have three fever free days for months. Breathing issues and full body aches were my biggest complaints. It was really hard especially with the relapses. I kept getting almost sick enough to go to the hospital but (they were very crowded where I lived) never quite met the emergency criteria my doc had. At one point in mid April I felt so hopeless like I'd never recover, i'd die, I'd never see my friends or family again, that I attempted suicide, but I survived. Most of the people in my life don't know I attempted. My last test in May was finally negative but my scans showed lingering damage that I don't know how long will last. When I overexert (like trying to walk or ride a bike) at all, I have to use an inhaler (didn't have asthma pre-COVID) and I get chest tightness. I am dealing with a lot of fatigue, and depression, and loneliness, and agoraphobia. It's difficult to not be very independent, very functional, and to be very much alone.

Average recovery - is it really 2 weeks like the CDC states?	Is anyone else simply exhausted trying to explain to their family members and coworkers that the average recovery isn't 2 weeks? Where did this time frame even come from, honestly? I keep looking for literature and I can't find any. It's as if this guideline came out of thin air. From the stories on this subreddit, it seems rare that anyone with moderate symptoms has recovered in 2 weeks without any relapses. I'd be interested in getting a poll together and presenting it to a news source, since the media does not seem interested in studying recovered coronavirus patients and hearing our stories.

Has anyone experienced this with COVID and gotten better without medical intervention?	Should I go to the emergency room?

My parents were together with someone suspicious yesterday, I’m abroad and coming home next week. What to do?	I told them many times, even when they are at outdoors that they should wear a mask. Last month they even got mad at me that I was staying home all time and told me to take my mask off because we are outdoors and I look weird af. They even argued with me when I told them we shouldn’t go on a vacation. I am abroad and just completed my quarantine here, and I’m here because of an important exam (I’m a med student) Anyways, last night they sat outdoors without mask on the same table with a guy. Today they learned that someone that guy interacted with someone covid positive like 10 hours before they were together with my parents. I told them to get tested (swab) or I’m not coming back. However I’m scared if it gives false-positive result. I have nowhere else to go anyways. I’m having panic attack right now and my exam is in a few days. A day later I’m supposed to be at home...

Tearing eyes as symptom?	Did anyone who tested positive have extremely tearing eyes? I’ve got red irritated skin at the corners of both eyes for several weeks now, and I’ve noticed my eyes are constantly tearing. No noticeable redness, but my eyes feel tired. I don’t get a ton of sleep so I chalked it up up to that.	Tearing eyes as symptom? Did anyone who tested positive have extremely tearing eyes?

If I have a mild case, will my parents catch the same “strain?”	Hey obviously I don’t know much about this, all that I know is that I’ve tested positive and my parents are now showing symptoms. Sorry if my science hope does not make sense at all. Just thinking of something to help ease my mind in this situation. I have a mild case day 6. No cough or fever yet. It looks like my mom is experiencing some cough and tiredness. I experienced tiredness day 1 and so far just can’t taste my food and smell. I’m young so I’m sure it’s mild that way. So I read anecdotes about how families have been recovering together, is it because they got sick from 1 person in the house that has a specific strain? Does that mean they might all have non severe cases? Or does it really all just come down to the person and the body? I think at this point I’m just trying to find at a ray of hope that since I’m mild my parents who caught it from me will be too. They’ve shown symptoms and today can be considered the first day. I feel fine and would go back to work if I didn’t know I	If I have a mild case, will my parents catch the same “strain?” Hey obviously I don’t know much about this, all that I know is that I’ve tested positive and my parents are now showing symptoms.

Got covid test Friday. Now its Saturday night and i'm still fatigued headache and some mucus. Waves of feeling better throughout the day then feeling like absolute shit again. I can't return to work or school until I get the results. I got the new thermometer today and no fevers for anyone in the house.

Week 7 - mucus is back, blurry vision, sinus pain	Im a 27F and was 100% symptom free (Minus red toes) for the entire month of April (tested positive March 24, last day of symptoms March 31) and now all of sudden it seems my mucus and chest tightness are starting to come back. It doesn’t feel as bad as before (yet) but it’s exactly the same feeling. I’m also definitely more tired every day, have blurry vision / tired eyes, and have an occasional sinus headache. I had the sinus pain before when I couldn’t taste or smell back in March, but the blurry vision is new. Is it possible I got it again? Or maybe it’s the 2nd wave of symptoms people were talking about? This is pretty crazy.

Is Rule 1 of this sub even remotely enforced?	I saw a similar post trending on here a week or so ago, so I hope this is ok to post.

I come to this sub to share my experiences recovering from the virus and support other people who have tested positive, not comfort some hypochondriac that’s seemingly incapable of using the search function of the sub. Not only that, but the stickied thread is no longer called “I think I have it” and is now just “general discussion.” So is rule 1 even in place anymore? I have never seen mods enforce it, like ever.

Tested Positive - I have a few questions	Tested positive on Friday with mild symptoms, I have a few questions (24/F)- I’ve had a headache for over a week but I just put it down to dehydration.

My mouth is dry no matter how much I drink and I just feel lethargic all the time. Sensitive to light and sound. Inability to concentrate. 1) is it better to stay warm or cold? I want fresh air but I don’t want to speed up the virus. 2) I drank quite a lot last week and didn’t feel tipsy at all, has anyone had this?

Getting tested tomorrow	Hi everyone. I had a virtual appointment with my PCP today after experiencing symptoms for the past few days. I’ve had random nausea, crazy fatigue, shortness of breath, congestion, coughing, no fever. My doc ordered a test and I’m going in the morning to be swabbed. She told me to quarantine and basically assume that I have it. And I’m pissed. I’ve taken this serious since the beginning. I wear a mask whenever I have to go anywhere, same with my kids. We have practiced social distancing from the get-go. I work from home and the only contact I have is with my family. My 18 year old stepson moved in last month and continues to go out with friends, goes to an indoor skate park, works at a place where nobody wears a mask. Complete disregard for other people in the house. It’s just so upsetting that I’ve worked so hard to keep myself and my kids safe and yet the risk is still so high in my house. Rant over. I really hope it’s just a cold.	Getting tested tomorrow Hi everyone. I had a virtual appointment with my PCP today after experiencing symptoms for the past few days.

Severe migraines possibly linked to COVID? (unconfirmed yet)	So about two days ago in the middle of the night, I spiked a fever, chills, body aches, a very sorry throat, a bunch of sores on the inside my mouth on my cheeks, swelling in one of my molar gums, and unbearable migraine. I went to a doctor for a nasal swab and am hoping to hear back tomorrow with the results, but my major issue with this whole thing so far, is the migraines. I'm not sure if it's more a migraine or a pulsing headache or what, but it only strikes when I have a high fever and I check my temperature every 2 hours, which could fluctuate anywhere from 98 to 102. Does anybody know how I can reduce or (God willing) get rid of these migraines? It's mainly in the front area of my forehead only and when it strikes, I try to snuff out any shred of light I can around me. In addition to this, I've tried a hot compress, cold compress, both sometimes, drinking plenty of liquids such as Pedialytes, Gatorade, water, hot tea, and I'm take meds such as DayQuil, NyQuil, ibuprofen, and Sudafed, but none of them seem to reduce	Severe migraines possibly linked to COVID?

Pulse Oximeter Readings and your emergency cut off	Asking for my mom as I am recovered from my symptoms.

COVID Positive Spouse	Hi all! First time posting, hopefully doing it right! While I was gone over last weekend, my husband started to feel ill. We both were tested on Wednesday, his coming back POSITIVE and mine NEGATIVE. We live in a one bedroom apartment and are separated as much as possible, but this can be hard in such a small space. He seems to have a “ minor” case (he still feels like 💩, doesn’t need hospitalization), but he is extremely worried because I have asthma. I have really already accepted I will get it, even with the precautions being taken. Has anyone had a partner infected in such a small space?? What major precautions did you take?

Hello, the reason I’m asking this is because I’ve been having gastrointestinal issues ever since Wednesday (slight nausea, loss of appetite, slight diarrhea, rapid heart rate, etc) but not the hallmark symptoms of Covid- no fever, no coughing, no loss of taste or smell, no body aches, no sinus pressure, I guess just a slight tightness in my chest. Honestly I think it might just be a stomach issue, but is it too early to tell and should I get tested?	Do I have Covid?

i'm in disbelief that i have covid	i've been sick since last tuesday, and stopped feeling sick on sunday. i've had the typical cold-like symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose, stuffy nose, and small headache. those were my only symptoms and it feels exactly like a cold. i was SHOCKED to learn that i just tested positive. i have had zero major covid symptoms and didn't even feel overly sick. i want to get tested again just to be sure. i'm thinking it could be a false positive. anyone have a similar experience?	i'm in disbelief that i have covid i've been sick since last tuesday, and stopped feeling sick on sunday. i've had the typical cold-like symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose, stuffy nose, and small headache. those were my only symptoms and it feels exactly like a cold. i was SHOCKED to learn that i just tested positive. i have had zero major covid symptoms and didn't even feel overly sick. i want to get tested again just to be sure. i'm thinking it could be a false positive. anyone have a similar experience?	0
No sense of smell but still can taste?	So I’ve been reading that those who are positive show early signs by losing their taste and smell, which is only half on my side. I haven’t been able to smell properly in 3 days but have been able to taste regularly more or less besides my tongue being sensitive at one point. Is this any cause to look further into this?

Fast forward to March 24th: Developed severe aches in my legs. I cried. It felt like I had run a marathon. Extremely painful. Even with massage and Tylenol they still hurt. No fever. No cough.

It felt like I worked out late at night and then slept only 5-6 hours. To put it in perspective. Brain fog. Tired but nothing crazy. 6 days later, minor headaches here and there. Nothing major. Still kind of sore feeling like I’m recovering from working out or something. Today, 8 days later (seems like a long time to me?), I woke up with a congested nose. Couldn’t blow the mucus out. Eventually went away after about an hour and didn’t come back. I have a dry cough. Sore throat but minor. Coughing up phlegm here and there. No fever. Super lethargic - not like I’m about to pass out from walking but more of fighting sleep really bad about 4 hours earlier than when I usually go to bed. Went home from work to be safe and trying to schedule for a test ASAP. Curious to know if anyone else had similar symptoms? People at work were acting like no fever was fine but I wanted to be safe.

My entire family has COVID-19 and we live in a small 2 bedroom apartment.	My dad is 66 yrs old and tested positive on the 23rd of this month and has been in the hospital. He will be there for a whole week. I found out I tested positive yesterday and I’ve been in isolation in my bedroom. My mom also tested positive and is isolating herself. The thing is, we all share the same 1 bathroom and shower. Once my dad comes home, he will have an oxygen tank and he’s gonna sleep in the living room because we don’t have enough rooms for all of us to quarantine. I have no idea what I’m supposed to do to help our family. Any suggestions? And no, we don’t have any friends or relatives to help us.

One positive and 3 negative tests in 4 days	Tested positive via PCR test on 9/29. Took another PCR test on 9/30 to confirm and tested negative. Additional PCR tests on 10/1 and 10/2 all came back negative. My close contacts are also negative at this point. MA DPH will not interpret the first result as a false positive and are requiring my close contacts to quarantine for 14 days from my 2nd negative test. Aside from being mentally exhausted from this week, I have no idea what to think. Did I have a false positive, which I read is extremely rare with PCR tests, or an extremely mild case that cleared up quickly? I've been asymptomatic throughout. Sharing this story here in the hope that this information will be useful to people.	One positive and 3 negative tests in 4 days Tested positive via PCR test on 9/29.

Sibling exposed now other sibling showing symptoms	I live with 2 of my siblings, one is an adult who is an essential worker but not in a hospital. Last night our sibling who is under 18 began extreme vomiting several times. They have not been out of the house in over a month due to quarantine with only the one essential worker coming and going from work. The sibling that is now sick does not often wash hands before eating and touches their face. How concerned should I be? The sick sibling has NOT been isolated since showing symptoms and because of the house layout isolation is impossible. When should I prepare for my own symptoms? I am late 20s with preexisting conditions.	Sibling exposed now other sibling showing symptoms I live with 2 of my siblings, one is an adult who is an essential worker but not in a hospital.

Is it okay to take over the counter medicine to fight symptoms? (Please read the entire post before replying though)	Okay so recently for the past 2 days now I've had congestion and a sore throat. It dosent feel like anything major just the usual that I get every so often. So I'm not saying its covid, but I'm also not removing the possibility from the table just yet. Unfortunately I cannot get tested though. So my question is. If someone has covid. Can I take over the counter medicine for basic stuff like sore throat or congestion to fight symptoms? Or is that going to make things worse since we dont know much about the virus. Thanks in advance!	Is it okay to take over the counter medicine to fight symptoms?

Smelling smoke??	I had covid from June 10- June 13. Very mild case. Low fever. No other symptoms. No loss of smell or taste. The last 48 hours I am experiencing the faint smell of oven burning or smoke or gas or so something like that. It was not over powering but I can smell it. Smells almost like the heater first turns on in a house. Except I have smelled it at both my offices and my home. Kind of comes and goes but is more constant at home. Sometimes so strong when I walked in this evening it made me a little nauseous. My kids had McDonalds but my husband couldn’t smell anything different. So weird. Doubt its seizures or brain tumor since this is more of a constant smell, not sudden. Wondering if it could be covid related messing with the smell receptors, even though its been almost 2 months.

I called the nurse's hotline and they said that since I am young (20 years old) and that my symptoms are not severe enough they will not test me at the nearest testing site (a hospital). They told me that I could go and get tested at one of the drive-thru testing sites, except I do not own a car or have anyone that can take me. The only option I have is to ride it out at home. My only issue is that even after I become symptom-less, how do I know that I can not spread this on? At what point do I become safe to everyone else?	I have all the symptoms, but they won't test me.

Random red pinpricks on skin?	I never tested PCR positive (tested negative twice, actually) but I DO have antibodies so I got it at some point. I am 2 months with ongoing URI issues, started with a sinus infection that migrated to the chest. Lingering symptoms are cough (often productive), sometimes chest tightness and shortness of breath which I can usually address with albuterol, and swollen lymph nodes. No fever, headache, or GI stuff. Got labs done Friday, EKG, metabolic panel, CBC and X-ray all normal. Just noticed last night that I’ve accumulated a lot of red dots all over my skin. Some look like tiny cherry angiomas, some just look like little blood spots. They’re pretty much everywhere but my face (even a couple on my palms). Not clustered, very random. Don’t itch, just a little alarming because they appeared so suddenly. Anyone else? Is this just another sign of ongoing inflammation?	Random red pinpricks on skin?

I am 2 months with ongoing URI issues, started with a sinus infection that migrated to the chest. Lingering symptoms are cough (often productive), sometimes chest tightness and shortness of breath which I can usually address with albuterol, and swollen lymph nodes. No fever, headache, or GI stuff. Got labs done Friday, EKG, metabolic panel, CBC and X-ray all normal. Just noticed last night that I’ve accumulated a lot of red dots all over my skin. Some look like tiny cherry angiomas, some just look like little blood spots. They’re pretty much everywhere but my face (even a couple on my palms). Not clustered, very random. Don’t itch, just a little alarming because they appeared so suddenly. Anyone else? Is this just another sign of ongoing inflammation?	0

How much time did you take off work to heal from covid?	I started having symptoms on Sept 21 and I’m still having symptoms that persist. I currently am working from home, but I’ve been off since last Tuesday because I’m lethargic. I feel bad for being off for almost a week, but I can’t do much during the day. How long did it take for you to go back to work? Onsite and online?	How much time did you take off work to heal from covid?

I’m high risk for catching COVID, I’m always anxious I have it. When did you realize you were actually getting sick?	I do COVID screenings in the ER. My only symptom (possibly pseudo-symptom) is that my chest feels a little bit tight, and my vocal cords/chest feel like I’ve gone for a run in the cold. I’m not coughing, just having to clear my throat of excess secretions that I think are coming from my larynx. It doesn’t feel like Postnasal drip. It feels like mild asthma maybe? I’ve never had asthma though. Or this is all allergy related! Yay anxiety!	I’m high risk for catching COVID, I’m always anxious I have it. When did you realize you were actually getting sick?

Dad was positive, 2 months after he still can’t eat much due to indigestion/ anxiety. Is this caused by covid. And please advice how to help my dad recover.	Hi All, we’re all feeling helpless here. My dad got covid last July. On his 3rd week after the positive result, he complained about indigestion. He go admitted because he can’t/ don’t want to eat due to indigestion. He was in the hospital for 10 days. They did heart and galbladder checks and all seem clear other than gallstones. Doctored cleared him that he doesn’t need surgery. He was also prescribed anxiety and sleeping meds. After almost 1.5 months being home, he hasn’t recovered much. Doctors all said there’s nothing wrong but he still can’t eat much. He can only eat oats, congee, milk of small amounts cause he complains that food gets stuck. Doctors stopped giving him anxiety meds. Now he still feel unwell and anxiety is high. He is scared to drink even water cause he says it gets stuck. It’s harder cause his mind tends to think negative right away and then he gets panic attacks. He feels hopeless now that the doctor stopped his meds. Is this due to covid. We would appreciate any advice	Dad was positive, 2 months after he still can’t eat much due to indigestion/ anxiety.

Chances of false negative?	Back towards the end of June I started getting this head congestion, and over a few days time I completely lost my sense of smell and taste. After a week it was improving, but took several weeks to come completely back. About a week after I got sick my 1 year old daughter had 101 degree fevers, double ear infection, and then this red pin prick sized rash that went all over her hands and legs towards the end of whatever she had. My boyfriend had a severe sore throat for about a week, mild body aches and fatigue. My 12 year old had a runny nose for like 2 days. And my newborn had a mild cough for about a month. My 66 year old mom had a runny nose and cough that is still lingering (never a fever) I did get tested on about day 4 of symptom onset and it was negative. Never in my life have I completely lost my sense of smell and taste. There was absolutely nothing there.

Experiencing hair loss?	Has anyone noticed they’re losing more hair than usual? I’m (27F) on day 97 after testing positive and have been losing much more hair than usual for the last 2 weeks. Wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same? I’ve had ongoing symptoms for most of the time since infection - mostly headaches and ear pressure.	Experiencing hair loss?

COVID positive person does not stay inside their room and invites boyfriend over	I live with my bf’s family and one of his sisters is COVID positive. We are a lot of people in the same house (7 + 5 dogs) and I am really scared that she is not following the necessary precautions and may be putting us at risk. She felt sick around Saturday and was walking around the house with no gloves or mask on. Once she was officially told she was positive she has not stayed in her room, and has been hanging out with her boyfriend who later pets the dogs and spends times around us. They both spend most of their day outside in the yard. Both use their masks but I am not sure about gloves. She walks in and out the house no matter of who is around and as she passes by the dogs she touches them. She works for the county so her family has been interviewed and we are quarantines until June 5. But how high is the risk of also getting the virus?

Covid19 recurrence and the medical establishment	I have spoken with several doctors who have said that Covid does not reoccur except in extremely rare cases. I am currently on Wave 2 of symptoms, and they have suggested that I had a false positive and it must be something else, despite me having a half dozen symptoms that are a perfect match for Covid. But reading on this forum, it seems pretty common for it to be 'cured' and then come back a couple of days later, usually milder on the second wave from what I've read as well as my own personal experience. The medical establishment seems to be suggesting that people testing positive a second time are just false positives for the dead virus and that in general it can't reinfect those who have recovered. My question is this: is the medical establishment wrong about the prevalence of recurrence? I've read enough reports on here to have very serious doubts. Yet the docs seem so sure of themselves when they talk. I would be grateful for any feedback and interested to hear your thoughts	Covid19 recurrence and the medical establishment I have spoken with several doctors who have said that Covid does not reoccur except in extremely rare cases.

Question about pattern/time of symptoms	Like a lot of people who deal with anxiety I am showing symptoms of COVID-19 and am freaking out wondering if I really got it or if my mind is playing tricks on me. I'm a 32 yr old male who drinks on occasion but exercises and rarely gets sick. This is only Day 3 for me showing symptoms so right now it's very manageable but I'm obviously worried it will escalate in the next few days. Days 1 and 2 I had a couple of fever readings at 99.5 but most of the day it was in the 98s. I've had chest tightness each day that would come and go, and now last night and this morning i had a few bouts of very minor shortness of breath that would only last about 10 minutes each. I also had a sore throat the first day but that has mostly gone away. I haven't had any dry cough, just voluntary coughing to clear my throat. My main question is do these symptoms come and go or are they consistently there? I've had chest tightness before from anxiety/heartburn and obviously shortness of breath is a classic anxiety symptom.

How likely is it I have Covid and should I get tested?	Hey, I don’t really know how to start this so here I go. Today (Wednesday) I woke up feeling normal just a little tired. But this afternoon I felt hot and have a temperature of 99.7. My throat is a little sore but I’ve had a lot worse. I also have a headache but again it’s mild. On Sunday I was extremely tired but fine Monday and Tuesday. I still have all my sense of taste and smell. I have always had bad allergies I should mention. I have not left my house so I could have only caught it from my parents. I’m M16. My mom has had no symptoms but my dad has had a mild cough and has been having loose stool a couple times a day. My parents say I’m overreacting cause I have a fear of getting things like diarrhea or vomiting(which is true and I’m very worried rn). Anyway just wanted to know if you think I should get tested.

Fast forward to today, my jaw node still slightly swollen, now only the right side of my neck/throat is swollen. But not sore or scratchy. No cough. No fever. First bowel movement was solid, but the other 2	0
Grandfather (70) tested positive today - Salty foods	My Grandfather received a call stating he has tested positive. The test was last Thursday (7/16). He experienced no symptoms, however he did mention to me on Saturday (7/18) that all the food he's eaten as of recent has been salty including plain porridge.

Strong heart beat?	I may have been exposed on June 20 to someone who eventually developed COVID symptoms. I took my test last Monday but am still waiting for results. Also on Monday, I had a slight pain in my chest and decided to do breathing exercises and take a warm shower. The water hitting my skin didn’t feel right and I felt something off with my body. I exited the shower, went downstairs and told my wife. That’s when my HR went to ~110 and I felt really uncomfortable. I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. Edit: forgot to mention that about an hour or so before this episode, I had a medium coffee (my second coffee of the day). I had a telemedicine appointment with a doctor who told me this may be an anxiety attack. I calmed down quite a bit hearing that, but every evening and during the night, I feel my heart beating hard (but not fast). I’ve sustained a normal resting heart rate between 58 - 85 BPM since then and my oxygen levels have been at or above 95%. I’ve also developed a very, very minor cough in the past	Strong heart beat?

My experience with Covid	This is based in my experience and I am not recommending anything, always consult with your doctor. Back in June, my wife (57), grandson (3) and I (58) tested positive for Covid. My wife was going to have a procedure at the hospital and a covid test was required to enter the hospital. It was Friday when she was tested. Saturday, next day my wife was tested and the day the hospital call us to let us know she was positive I took a test and was negative. She did not have symptoms until Saturday. I had symptoms until Monday. Took a new test Wednesday and came up positive. We live in a border town with Mexico. I already had ivermectin, azithromycin, and prednisone as a precaution because covid was hitting very hard in Arizona (some days the positive rate in my town 25%). The doctors here in USA told us to only take Tylenol. And if we get very sick go to the hospital. We did not follow their advice. We begun taking ivermectin 12mg (two tabs) daily for 10 days. 5 days one tab azithromycin, 1 tab prednisone 50mg for 7 days.

22 Y/0 and monitoring severe symptoms.	I am concerned I may have contracted COVID-19, I am going in for testing tomorrow. My throat is ticklish, not sore so it seems like a dry cough but I also am a recovering smoker with asthma so productivity is not uncommon. My mucus is clear right now with charcoal streaks, a common sight but I am worried that it might progress into something worse over time. I read an article in the past that stated it starts in the throat and progressively makes it's way to the lungs. My anxiety has me monitoring that 24/7 and struggling to relax or properly rest. I know because I'm young that my odds are greater for success, but there is always that chance regardless how small. I would like to ask the question, if you tested positive with COVID-19, what were your symptoms and how did you cope with them? Did you feel worse before getting better, did you develop bronchitis? I could be feeding my anxiety but I'm worried if I end up coughing/producing phlegm it could be a sign that it's going to be a worst case scenario.	22 Y/0 and monitoring severe symptoms.

Burning throat? Wheezing?	This is probably my most annoying symptom. I had a sore throat but it’s been also burning. Just when I thought I was getting better I tried walking today but then was wheezing by the end. I’m usually fairly fit, but the burning throat and shortness of breath is at its worst today and it’s freaking me out. My friend said this is how her asthma feels. I’m at 98 on my pulse ox and emailed my doctor but am just curious if anyone else had this and how long it lasted? I’m usually not an anxious person with diseases since I work in a hospital but my anxiety is high with this one.	Burning throat? Wheezing? This is probably my most annoying symptom.

Anyone else had a rash?	I first had symptoms 2 weeks ago, had my positive test back 10/9 and thought I was clearing it over the last day or two, I’ve felt much better. Yesterday afternoon, I started getting an itchy left foot, and over the last 24 hours it’s developed a red rash and is still really itchy, I’ve done a bit of digging and think it’s the so called ‘Covid Toe’. Just wondering if anyone has experience of this, and how long it lasted, as it’s driving me mad, definitely the most annoying symptom so far!	Anyone else had a rash?

Did you experience any of these symptoms?	The last few weeks I've battled insomnia (never an issue in the past), going into work late due to exhaustion, and constantly feeling overly hot. Starting Friday afternoon, I had horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea. On Saturday, I was beyond exhausted and slept until 5pm. I was given the ultimatum to get up or get up and go to the hospital. I layed on the couch and watched a couple movies before heading to bed around 10. Today I felt the same way but forced myself to get up. It felt a tad bit better getting up and around, followed by having lunch. Shortly after I crashed and felt just as exhausted again. Soon my head started to hurt(on and off) and I felt nausea kick in. As of writing this, I still do not have any sore throat but I have overly dry feeling nostrils and clogged ears. What do you all think?

Am I showing early symptoms, or overreacting?	Hi all, yesterday I started feeling nauseous which caused me to stay in bed for most of the day. After the nausea completely subsided and I woke up from a nap, I had a very slight tightness/pressure in my chest and a feeling as if I couldn’t take a very deep breath. No pain whatsoever though. Had very very slight diarrhoea that morning too. It’s the next day now and all I have been feeling is that slight pressure in my chest every now and again. Should I be getting a test?

Does it make sense - having 99 SPO2 but still having difficulty breathing?	I have been diagnosed with COVID day before yesterday and was admitted to a hospital today. My SPO2 seem to be constant at 99 but I'm having lackness of breath. The nurse told me that it's because I think I'm shortness of breath but I actually don't. I can't get my head around this. It's getting worse for me as I feel the need to breathe is more oxygen. I'm M 22.	Does it make sense - having 99 SPO2 but still having difficulty breathing?

I’ve been given the opportunity to get vaccinated, I know family members who did and they don’t have any side effects. Since the vaccine is not yet fully tested I worry about its long term effects if any. So I’m torn between getting the vaccine and its potential side effects vs risking getting covid in the future.

Anyone covid + and dealing with discrimination?	My husband is positive, everyone in our community knows it. We are currently under quarantine as he recovers. Our postman will put mail in our mailbox every day but won't take my outgoing mail out. I have bills that have been sitting in my mailbox for four days. We have a different carrier on Saturdays and I'm hoping that person will be willing to take our mail today.

I have an adult step child who does not live with us but lives in our community. He has not been around us at all through all of this. He goes to town periodically to pick up groceries, etc. for his family and some extended high risk relatives we have. He's using curbside pickup, practicing social distancing, etc. just like everyone else here, but he's had a couple of people he's seen while out, chastise him for not being completely quarantined like we are.

My husband and I presumed positive - would love your thoughts.	My husband and my presumed COVID-19 journey We are both 40, both asthmatic, both “borderline” blood pressure diagnosed within the last year. I had preeclampsia during a recent (2018) pregnancy and have been on blood pressure meds since but might not still have high BP, we haven’t trialed off the meds. First of all I should note that neither of us has been tested. My husband is 100% certain we are positive. He’s very science-minded so I’m surprised he’s so sure without the test. I think it’s 50/50. And I just can’t be sure until we have a test (which will likely be an antibody test by the time it happens). I should also mention that all things considered our symptoms were mild.

Persistent ear/hearing issues?	I tested positive 3/23 and had about 4-5 days of sweats/chills, coughing, headache and nausea. My loss of taste only lasted 2-3 days. Afterwards, I noticed this pressure in my ears and was sensitive to sounds I'd never been before--- I hear this loud rumbling in my ears during noises like crinkling plastic food packaging, certain tones of voice talking, or even chopsticks set down on a hard surface. It seems worse some days than others, but never seems to go away completely. For the most part my nose isn't runny, it feels like it's pretty dry up there, and I can breathe through it my nose. I've had minor recurrences of headache and nausea since.

Constant chest pressure/tightness since late May/early June?	So I just stumbled onto this thread and it has been eye opening. I (28F) have had a literally constant chest pressure/tightness/squeezing heaviness since late May, accompanied by it being painful for me to take deep breaths. In June and July it was accompanied by an intense burning sensation, which led me to urgent care in a panic in July, thinking I was having a heart attack. My blood pressure was normal, chest X-ray normal, ekg normal. They gave me a GI cocktail which did absolutely nothing, then they basically told me they didn’t know what was wrong and to follow up with my GP. My GP told me to eat a bland diet and take Prilosec twice a day, which has done nothing. The Advil cold and sinus with pseudoephedrine helps sometimes, but not all of the time. My symptoms have flared up this week, which coincidentally I am PMSing. The burning sensation has disappeared for the most part, but I still have this constant chest pressure/squeezing sensation and it hurts to breathe deeply. Other than this I’m in good health: 5’6, 120 pounds, normal blood pressure, normal blood oxygen, go running multiple times a week (exercise neither helps	Constant chest pressure/tightness since late May/early June?

My GP told me to eat a bland diet and take Prilosec twice a day, which has done nothing. The Advil cold and sinus with pseudoephedrine helps sometimes, but not all of the time. My symptoms have flared up this week, which coincidentally I am PMSing. The burning sensation has disappeared for the most part, but I still have this constant chest pressure/squeezing sensation and it hurts to breathe deeply. Other than this I’m in good health: 5’6, 120 pounds, normal blood pressure, normal blood oxygen, go running	0
Sinus Congestion!?	So, I've seen tons of stuff saying this or that. Can't seem to find an exact answer to this. I've been tracking my symptoms for six days. Despite having an immune deficiency, everything (knock on wood) has been mild. Sinus congestion is insane. Face is puffy. Sneezing. Post nasal drip. Cough is sometimes productive, sometimes not(sometimes I feel scratchy, sometimes I don't). Breathing feels okay as I did a 2.5 mile walk and I have had zero issues with bowel movements. The wife and I both had a day, mainly at night where we went as high as 99.7 temperature. We sweat like crazy that night and haven't had that issue since. I notice when I'm outside, I feel better than inside and inside I feel a bit scratchy. It's weird and obviously with my immense health history I'm a bit nervous. While I am tired, I feel like I can do a lot and without much tax to me. Can anyone give me some pointers?	Sinus Congestion!? So, I've seen tons of stuff saying this or that.

Coronavirus IgG Antibody Positive - My Story	Had mild symptoms of a bad sinusitis or a cold. Had a 100.3 fever for a night. That same night, had a super high heart rate, sweats, and a 100.3 fever when I thought I was about to wind down and go to bed. I just remember sitting on my bed saying it’s time to sleep now, not had a 135 heart rate. Instead I called 911. But I wasn’t having a heart attack. Paramedics came, there was “nothing wrong” they could find. Went to the ER anyway for a night and they diagnosed me with anxiety and a CBC that had super low lymphocytes. Like, AIDS low. But doctors weren’t that worried because all my other levels were normal. Nothing suggested anything else except I was “probably fighting something off”. My fever wasn’t high and dropped right away with a Tylenol. They gave me an Ativan and sent me home. My heart rate came down to 98. This was mid-February. A week later after analyzing a stool sample I submitted because I was also having horrible abdominal gas and sulfur farts, I got a diagnosis of Sapo Virus. I had been having horrible GI symptoms for two weeks before	Coronavirus IgG Antibody Positive - My Story Had mild symptoms of a bad sinusitis or a cold. Had a 100.3 fever for a night.

The guidelines for when we’re no longer contagious are stupid	I was bed ridden for 10 days straight. I got tested on day 15 of my symptoms and I’m currently on day 18 feeling fine. So on day 15 I tested positive, the guidelines say 7 days after onset of symptoms and three days after you’re not experiencing fever without medication. I tested positive on day 15 and wasn’t feeling great but definitely not dealing with a fever anymore. I’m on day 18 (self quarantine for 20 days) and pretty sure I haven’t spiked a temperature in a couple days at least. But I tested positive just three days ago... so when am I no longer contagious? I have absolutely no problem staying home and continuing to practice social distancing. I just wish there was a better guideline to when recovered people are safe to be around. I’m going to continue quarantining myself for another 14 days minimum just to be on the safe side.	The guidelines for when we’re no longer contagious are stupid I was bed ridden for 10 days straight.

Symptom duration on relapse	35M no previous conditions, exercised regularly 3d/w before this. I had it back in 30/3 with SOB developing at the start of April. I been having almost all wave-like symptoms described by long haulers ( sob, body aches, GI issues, neck pain, chest pain and tightness, etc). Two weeks ago I finally got rid of SOB, and tiredness, along with almost all other symptoms. However, tree days ago I started feeling an itchy throat, and a light cough and today I have 98.6F (37C) of temperature again ( it was the same back in April). I know there are some people who had a sort of relapse/reinfeccion. Can you tell me please how long it lasted the second time and how bad it was? Thank you all.

Slight symptoms HELP??	I've had an itchy throat since early March 2020. After all the pubs came back I started back at work. I work in a pub which serves food and obviously alcohol, the past week there has been over 20 cases in the area that I work in (it's a town centre). As of last night I started to suffer with a seriously sore throat, nasal drip and a slight temperature. Is this covid? Or is it just a cold and I'm being paranoid?

Still Symptomatic During Round 2 of COVID	Looking for some input from others who may have or are currently going through what I’m going through. I’m currently going on 5+ weeks of symptoms caused by COVID19. I’m still coughing with shortness of breath and have fatigue which will not go away. Namely, I keep having attacks/episodes almost nightly with a cough and difficulty breathing. I’ve been to the ER twice now for my symptoms. I’ve been referred to pulmonology here this week. My question is, has there been anyone who has been diagnosed with asthma as a result of your COVID symptoms and experience? For reference, I have not yet been diagnosed with asthma. It’s just been talked about, particularly since an albuterol inhaler seems to help my symptoms when initially administered. Additionally, I was presumed positive in March from my doctor. So lucky me, I’ve gotten this twice.	Still Symptomatic During Round 2 of COVID Looking for some input from others who may have or are currently going through what I’m going through.

Taste went away, came back and it now too strong?	I started showing symptoms, including drastically reduced taste, last Tuesday. I had a lab test on Wednesday that was negative and a rapid test on Saturday that was also negative, but based on my symptoms, known exposures and my respiratory issues I was told I probably had it and behave as though I did. All I could taste was salt/sweet/acid. It was pretty much normal by this Tuesday, but today (Thursday) everything tastes super exaggerated. Anything sweet is like just mainlining sugar out of the container and anything salty is like pouring the whole container of salt in my mouth. I ordered lasagna from the local place down the road, with bread and a salad and it is all soooooooooooo salty. I even tried plain lettuce and it was salty. I tried a mini tortilla with butter, which has been my go to this whole time, even it tastes like I took the salt grinder to it and went to town. No flavor other than just mounds and mounds of salt. Is this normal when getting your taste back? If so, how long am I going to have these fluctuations? If it's not normal, what do I need to do?	Taste went away, came back and it now too strong?

Those with lingering / long-term chest pain or tightness...	**Did your chest pain &amp; tightness eventually resolve, or are you continually improving?** **What did you do (tests, meds, supps) to identify or help it?** \----------------- I'm on Day 60. Mostly better, but still dealing with chest pain and tightness. Sternum area + right side of sternum. Getting worried about lung damage, clotting, etc. I was using Albuterol inhaler for 30\~ days but stopped in case it's making things worse. Don't think it's meant for long-term daily use several times a day. I also tried a steroid inhaler (Arnuity) 2 weeks ago, but had a virus relapse and stopped it just in case it was the cause. Supps: NAC, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Turmeric, L-Lysine, Quercetin, Zinc, Olive Leaf Extract O2 levels: &gt;96, testing at home Thanks!

Did anyone have a case that presented like a cold/sinus infection?	Did anyone here have a confirmed case that only presented like a cold/sinus infection? I have had a sore throat (mainly in the mornings from post nasal drip), not too congested throughout the day but occasionally need to blow my nose, had a low grade fever (99.1) in the mornings, some aches, a complete loss of smell, and a dulled sense of taste. I did get a test but the results are taking forever. I’m just curious to see if any positive person had a case like this?

How likely is it for someone to have vomiting as a symptom?	My family and I have been around someone who was exposed to someone who tested positive. We're not sure if they tested positive too.

Weird tastes or smells after loss of taste/smell due to COVID?	Do any of you who lost your sense of smell/taste due to COVID ever experience new weird tastes in your mouth for no identifiable reason? Or aftertastes? Or weird smells? I had a mild case of COVID in March, lost my taste/smell, and have recently gained back about 80% of it. Now, certain tastes/smells are a little.... funky... Examples: \- Today I sipped water from my steel-lined water bottle and noticed a weird tart(?), almost citric(?) aftertaste. It was definitely a tinge of sweetness. I've had this bottle for years and never had this issue before. \- I've noticed that my pet's chicken food and my frozen chicken have the exact same smell. I am so turned off by the frozen chicken now because of this. It's a somewhat sour smell, not really bad but just...distinct. Has this happened to you?

My grandma (87) tested positive after being in and out of the hospital for other health issues. Life sucks	I live with her. She had already been in and out of the hospital dealing with auto-immune anemia. (I’m not sure of the clinical name for it). Which has already been pretty bad considering she’s older and it had already been making her very, very weak. The hospital was allowing 1 visitor at a time. Theres 7 of us in my house, we all took turns visiting her and last time was about 2 weeks ago. Her anemia was getting better, so she got transferred to a rehab place to start physical therapy to get stronger. This place didn’t allow visitors, and after about a week in there doing PT she went back to the ER with a high fever and got diagnosed with COVID the next morning. This was Saturday night/Sunday morning. Her fever went away the next day and hasn’t come back, but she’s been on oxygen. Been 4-5 days now. Super weak. Hasn’t gotten worse I guess, but just hanging in there.

Hasn’t gotten worse I guess, but just hanging in there. We’re assuming she got it at the rehab place, because nobody in my house is sick,	2
Covid positive since August 16th	So I’ve taken four tests and all have stated I’m positive. At first it just felt like my allergies were acting up, running nose, headaches, slight cough, and scratchy throat. That lasted about 5 days. Now I have a headache every so often but I’m still testing positive. Has anybody experienced similar issues? My health department told me to isolate for 10 days after my symptoms started, which was over August 26th. But now I’m just worried to see any family and friends on the chance that I could get them sick even though I’m not experiencing any symptoms.

Tested positive for COVID-19 back in March, got tested for antibodies on 5/16 and showing negative IGG antibodies.	I got tested on March 23 at work since I am a healthcare worker and at the time they were offering it to employees who had symptoms. At the time I had mild symptoms, headache, stomach pain, and fatigue. Got the results back and said I was positive and was told to stay home and quarantine. At home my symptoms were mostly mild. Headache, loss of appetite and smell, fatigue, low fever, and muscle pain. I didn't have any coughing. My fiancee was the one who took care of me and unfortunately she got sick which I am assuming is because of me. She got sick around April 5 and around the end of April was when she has mostly recovered minus her on and off coughing. She had it worse with a high fever, coughing, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite and smell, the works. Thankfully no shortness of breath. Fast forward we decided to take the antibody test this past weekend and just got results. I assumed we would both have antibodies but only she did. She had a positive IGG while I was negative. Any idea why that could be? I was thinking maybe I just have a	Tested positive for COVID-19 back in March, got tested for antibodies on 5/16 and showing negative IGG antibodies.

I TESTED POSITIVE, I NEED MOTIVATION	I am 22 and tested positive today. Yesterday I went to a testing site and the result came out negative; I didn't believe it so I went to another site today and as suspected it came out positive. I have been having many symptoms: cough, body aches, blocked nose, a sore/scratchy throat, low-grade fever, headache and malaise. Walking or physical exertion gets me tired and gives me dizziness. My anxiety doesn't help me at all. I'm just a little afraid now that I actually have COVID because of it's unprecedented nature. Any words of motivation or remedies will help very much. Thank you and a fast/speedy recovery for all.	I TESTED POSITIVE, I NEED MOTIVATION I am 22 and tested positive today.

I think my mom is getting worse and I don’t know how I can help her, since I am positive as well.	We’re not a very close family and if she’s sick she likes to hide it. I tested positive last week but have since recovered, I was very mild. She started showing symptoms a few days after me and has a test tomorrow. I know she’s positive and to be quite honest I know she sort of blames me for bringing it in the house. The first few days I kept asking if she needed to see the doctor because she’s around 53 and has diabetes so it could be hard for her. She kept saying she’s getting better and it seemed like she was. Yesterday she was laughing on the phone, today it sounded like her voice had lots of mucus in when she talks. I hear her dry cough occasionally but it’s not constant. Today, her face seemed redder as well but she says she can breathe okay still, just looks extremely tired. She must be on around day 10-12 or so, taking medication (mucinex) and zinc as well. She won’t really respond to me with a straight answer when I ask if she’s getting better or worse...because it’s on and off sometimes now.

Anxiety or COVID	Over the past few days, I've started to get very anxious about me having COVID, and haven't been able to stop thinking about it (as a result I've started feeling worse). As of now, the only symptom I have is a tickle in the back of the throat (started last night), yet I am rarely coughing. I've been monitoring my temperature since a few days ago and its always coming out normal. My throat isn't sore and I am not having any trouble breathing,. &amp;#x200B; I'm always wearing a mask whenever I am not home (I mainly go to a small doctor's office for certain treatments) - and I am not going to any social gatherings. I am planning on going to get tested today, but am I overthinking it or is there a possibility I could have COVID?

Coronavirus with asthma	I'm a 26 year old female in USA. Past medical history: developed asthma after I had really bad bronchitis in 9th grade. My asthma has only been well controlled for the past few years, before then I would be at the hospital constantly with low oxygen and asthma attacks. I'm on albuterol and Symbicort 2 puffs twice a day. Here is my symptoms timeline: 03/24: cough developed. Sweated a lot, but I'm typically sweaty. Temperature of 99.5 03/25: cough, but passed daily checkpoint screening to be allowed to work that shift. severe headache and body aches started around 2ish, no temp in the morning but at night it was around 102, only dipping a little bit after tylenol. Sense of smell started to diminish. I called my doc and this was my last day of work. 03/26: cough, sore throat, headache, body aches especially middle of upper back, fever of 100-101, slept horribly because I was in so much pain and felt horrible. Lost sense of taste and smell completely. 03/27: took my very uncomfortable test at the hospital, where it felt like they shoved a footlong cotton swab thru my nose and into my brain lol.

Ladies: Covid messing with menstrual cycle?	Tested positive. Any women experienced an early period or messed up period while positive with Covid? Usually my body is like clockwork and I’ve noticed some strange things and was curious if anyone else experienced the same thing? I’ve read being sick can delay your cycle. But in my case it’s started 7 days early. It could have been the supplements I was taking as I was trying to recover. But curious to hear your input!

Sore throat? That’s it?	So my boyfriend and I went to a restaurant to eat, and we learned through a grape vine that someone there was asymptomatic but was positive. Now, it could have been our server or someone else’s. But now I’m worried. I’ve had a sore throat ever since the very next day, no fever, (I’ve been checking pretty much all day, every day), no shortness of breath, no cough, no congestion, no muscle pain. Nothing...except this sore throat. It just feels dry, and water seems to help it. I have bad anxiety and my mouth is dry, and I don’t know if my worrying is adding to it, or if it’s post nasal drip, because it gets worse when I lay down. Someone ease my mind? It just seems weird.

Just tested positive this past Monday 6/8	Started off as a cough which came out of nowhere. I felt completely fine all day and then boom. Cough. Later that night I started getting hot but no real fever. I it felt like I was getting a cold with the sniffles and sinus pressure so I didn’t think it could be Covid. But my test came back positive. I completely lost my taste/smell senses for a couple days which was trippy. And the shortness of breath didn’t hit me until yesterday when I was trying to do laundry. But today I’m experiencing extreme nausea and migraine.	Just tested positive this past Monday 6/8 Started off as a cough which came out of nowhere. I felt completely fine all day and then boom.

When should I go back to work?	I tested positive on July 21st and had a pretty rough couple of weeks. Headache, fever, cough(still have it), extreme fatigue and even took a few trips to ER. My sister also tested positive but had a very mild case, and my mom(65+yrs) tested negative but it’s possible she was asymptomatic and she has a weird cough but says she feels fine. I’m feeling better minus being tired and my vision is a little off and finally able to eat a little more but now I’m curious when I should go back to work. I mentioned that I probably wouldn’t be back for another week and a half or so but now what do I do? I’ve gotten major anxiety from exposure and I am an administrative assistant working in a dance studio. Right now we’re closed for classes but starting this “learning hub” where students can come and do their homework...kind of like a daycare. I’m going to call my doctor tomorrow but is there any advice out there for going back to work? Work days are usually about 6+ hrs.	When should I go back to work?

Does childhood immunizations offer some protection against the COVID-19 infection in children?	[https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus031620](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/03/16/coronavirus031620) &amp;#x200B; As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the globe and as more information is becoming available, I am wondering if childhood vaccines have prevented widespread morbidity and mortality among the pediatric population. We know that the immune systems of both the very young and the elderly can be immature or decline in immune function over time respectively. An infant’s inmate immunity is muted at birth due to the potential sharing of non-shared maternal antigens and to ignore the considerable amount of stress and re-modelling that takes place during fetal development. Weak Th1 and antibody response in infants exposes them to a higher risk of complications from bacterial and viral infections. The effects of aging include decreased production as well as the decreased functions of both B and T cells. The effects of impaired immune functions in infants and the elderly can be demonstrated in respiratory viral infections like RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). On average, during RSV season, over 50,000 children age 0-5yo are hospitalized each year, while there were over 170,000 hospitalizations for adults over the age of 65.

Mostly just chest pains and taste muted, tested negative, did anyone else experience just these symptoms?	Hi all, about mid April one day I had chest pains all day long but I have anxiety so I thought it might be that and ignored it. During that week, the pains came and went, I had one day where my back hurt, one day where I got a migraine, and one day where I had diarrhea. But I never had a fever or sore throat. Then for a couple of weeks after I got chest pains randomly. They would last for about three days then go but not be worse when I breathed in or out, they were just constant stabbing type pains. I tried xanax but the chest pains stuck around. Then early May my sense of taste was definitely off. I could not taste my toothpaste after I brushed my teeth but I could taste chocolate. Everything else seemed really muted unless it was a strong taste like soy sauce. I finally got tested in mid May and it came back negative. It was a throat swab. Part of me still thinks I had it, but my roommates did not get sick or have any other symptoms that were odd or could not just be stress.

Exposed 6 days ago	Hi everyone, I’m a 22M from MI. My roommate came to our apartment on June 18 (he’s been living back home this summer) to move some things out. We had a pizza and beer and hung out for a couple hours. I fear I may have accidentally drank from his drink as well. The next day he returned home and started getting sick and tested positive. I got tested 4 days later on the 22 at CVS, and the results came back negative. The last couple days however I have had a very dry throat, not very sore but it almost feels like When you breath through your mouth when sleeping. No other notable symptoms so far. I’m thinking of getting tested again in the next day or two. Any advice? Has anyone else started with a dry throat feeling? Did I get tested too early for it to be accurate?

Right now this is what I’m dealing with: Head ache. Feeling run down. Scratchy throat. Chest feels a little wheezy. Occasional sneezes. Dry nose—nose bleed today. No fever, but go from hot to cold. My head and body feel similar to when you have a cold. My joints hurt earlier this week, but I wondered if it was because of house I slept. No fever. No cough. All of the above has been very mild. My question is should I even waste my time speaking to a doctor and/or getting tested? Did any of you have such mild symptoms you could’ve mistook them for allergies? I don’t want to overreact, but I also don’t want to be careless. My risk of exposure is very low, but cases are skyrocketing in the area.	Allergies Did you test positive with allergy symptoms?

Covid and Oral Contraceptives	Hi all. I (25F) tested positive for covid on August 5th (so I am on week 8). I was worried about clotting since I am on a birth control pill containing drospirenone, which is potentially linked to increased clot risk. I talked to my doctor and she said that really only matters if you’re a smoker, which I’m not. I felt some relief once I felt better after day 10, but some symptoms have shown up / come back (SOB, chest pain, chest tightness, sore throat), and I’m starting to worry again. Is anyone else on a birth control pill or talked to your doctors about this risk? I am just looking for any info to potentially ease my mind or help me plan for risk mitigation. I’d like to note that I took baby aspirin during my first 8 days of illness, but the same doctor told me to stop taking it. Thanks!	Covid and Oral Contraceptives Hi all.

Difficulty breathing for over 32 days	Is anyone else still struggling to fully recover? My fever and weakness have completely subsided 2 weeks ago. But I am not able to breathe as easily as before getting sick, it's making it hard to focus on any sort of work. I'm also not sure when it's safe to go back to cardio exercise. Has anyone else been sick for this long (ex. with difficulty breathing)?	Difficulty breathing for over 32 days Is anyone else still struggling to fully recover?

Did my husband have it?	My husband moved here from the UK on July 5.

How long until you can be reinfected?	I know this has been a massive debate in this sub for awhile now, people claiming they’ve been reinfected while others argue its just long term symptoms. I’ve been reading that many studies show antibodies fade after a couple of months (2-3 months) Wondering if anyones heard anything otherwise?? I tested positive on June 1st so if that is the case I should be peaking on antibodies right now lol.	How long until you can be reinfected?

Chance of my sibling getting infected from exam center?	My brother had to appear for exam yesterday with all candidates having to use 3-ply surgical masks provided by the exam center. Around 50-60 were in his room with one seat gap between each. During the 3 hour test, 8-10 candidates had their mask below nose and mouth. The exam room had AC on for sometime but were turned off for the rest of the test. My brother had mask on properly. What are his odds of infection? My region has very widespread infection.

Back to daycare?	We have a three year old son and my husband has mentioned a few times that we should consider sending our son back to daycare since cases are not spiking anymore in San Antonio, TX and it has been hard for us both working full time and having him home. Additionally, he is missing out on time with his friends and learning from his teachers (we are unable to provide much in the way of school activities or anything due to us both working). My husband's mom also expressed concern about our son's socialemotional needs. I know that many people have had to send their kids to daycare because they have no choice, and I feel grateful we've been able to keep our son home to protect our family and help space out our son's class. I still feel afraid that if I send him back now he'll catch it and have long term issues and I'll never forgive myself. I also worry that if we catch it from him we won't be able to take good enough care of him if we're super sick. But as my husband and others have said, we can't wait forever.

I don’t know if I have COVID19 can someone help please!	I have sore throat for a week now no fever but just a few coughs and sneezes in day 3 and no more cough since then. It’s day 7 and still I don’t see any new symptoms appear but I really concern about those symptoms that I had early on. May I ask are those symptoms are the first stage of COVID19 ? And how can I know if it is a COVID19 or not beside testing my blood because to where I live right now they only give testing to the person who really need it in this situation. Thank you so much.

Long termers: best imaging test for chest pain?	13 weeks here. I have a ton of peripheral nerve pain still (diagnosed with post-viral neuritis) but I also have bad ongoing chest pain. It’s been a relentless burning, but now it’s back to stabbing when I take breath, and I’m back on an inhaler that seems to help. I haven’t slept on my side in three months, and I don’t like sitting in chairs. I had a clear chest x-ray back on March 31. My cardiologist doesn’t think it’s the heart, but offered an echocardiogram to check for pericardial effusion, but he didn’t think it likely, so I haven’t done it. My heart hasn’t felt weird for two months or so. Nobody has proposed any other tests. Is there a test that would be most useful here? Something that could cover heart and lungs? It’s 13 weeks of this bullshit, I need a starting place, I’m not made of money, and it’s clear the doctors are not in charge here. Has anyone found anything at this stage...?

Possibly had it back in February...	At the end of Feb. and early Mar. I was sick with the flu for 3 weeks and I had a sore throat that lasted for the same amount of time. I never experienced SOB but I've never been sick like that before. Granted I've never had the flu shot in my life. I never went and got tested for the flu. I didn't think it was COVID-19 because it didn't blow up in the U.S. until mid-Mar. It was about the second to last day before I was finally over it and I was BURNING up. My back and chest were dripping in sweat. That was the only time I felt like I had a fever. But ever since then I can't stop coughing. I've never had a prolonged cough like this in my life. I live at home but no one in my house got sick besides me (I do stay in my room 95% of the time though). Should I try seeking out an antibody test? But then again who knows how long the antibodies last...	Possibly had it back in February... At the end of Feb. and early Mar.

Explaining Post-Virus to Friends	So I had COVID-19 and it was pretty mild for most of the time. It started to get worse about a month ago and there was a solid 5 days where I couldn’t get out of bed because I felt so terrible. The days I could get out of bed I didn’t feel like I had energy to do things I normally would (like workout etc). I’m also a musician and I play a wind instrument, and I 100% had no energy to play it. So as I’m sure a lot of others here can relate to, I didn’t do much for a few weeks while I was sick. This week I’m finally feeling better and I’m starting to get back into things I really should be doing for my profession/ for myself. Anyway, I was practicing my instrument today and I felt like it’s definitely harder to breathe than it used to be. It’s not like something is wrong but it’s just something I’ve noticed after having COVID-19. And it takes a lot of air to play my instrument. I was kind of bothered by this and I told my roommate about how frustrating it was. He replied that	Explaining Post-Virus to Friends So I had COVID-19 and it was pretty mild for most of the time.

Restless Legs after infection?	Thought I’d post and see if anyone could relate. I had very, very mild symptoms when positive about 2 months ago.

I’ve found that general squats can help relieve it, but it is very frustrating and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this or if it is just being caused by something else?

Can steroid puffers worsen SOB due to covid?	I was prescribed a steroid puffer because the specialist I saw suggested my symptoms are asthma related not covid, so while I wait for a pulmonary function test he gave me flovent. I have had SOB for 4 weeks without any other symptoms and tested negative for COVID. I am still not convinced I don't have Covid. I could be having some sort of post viral inflammation like many on this thread. I raised this with the specialist and he said viral inflammation would be his backup diagnosis if it isn't asthma. Question is, would being on a steroid puffer worsen my SOB if it isn't due to asthma? Today I feel especially awful with my SOB and it's the third day of my new puffer.. I'm concerned it is worsening it or I could just be having a bad day.	Can steroid puffers worsen SOB due to covid?

Care package to send to someone who tested positive?	Hi guys, I just found out my roommate tested positive. She’s asymptomatic currently. I’ve never met her in person as I’m an incoming freshman and she live’s 2000 miles away (I’m in PA she’s in AZ.) My heart is broken for her right now as I cannot imagine how scary this is for her right now. I live in an extremely rural community that hasn’t been hit very hard by the virus so she’s the first person I personally know to be affected. I was wondering if anyone could provide some ideas for a care package to send her? I want to show her I care for her and I also want to do anything in my power to make her feel more comfortable.

Is it covid?	Live in Florida and 33. I occasionally get allergies when I wake up.

Mild symptoms?	Hi, me and my partner are showing mild symptoms. Mostly fatigue and headache while my partner has been coughing a little bit. I’m concerned that we might be overreacting by not going to work etc etc and would just like to hear some mild symptoms stories? I’ve been brought up to go to work and school if you’ve got a cold and to power through etc which is obviously a total counterpoint to what we should be doing at this moment. Thank you.

Worried about sense of smell	I (21F) had had a stuffy nose for a couple days, but no other symptoms besides the occasional cough, so I thought it was just seasonal allergies. Someone else at my work was confirmed positive, though, so we all got checked. Yesterday I had body aches all over and lost my sense of smell. Sure enough, they called in with my results today, and I'm COVID-19 positive. I'm isolating at home as well as I can, and mostly I'm not super worried about fighting it off, but... not being able to smell things at all is kind of terrifying? I was going to put tea tree gunk on my chest to help clear my nose, and couldn't smell it at all. I can't help worrying it might be gone permanently. I'm trying really hard not to freak out but I'm really scared it might not come back and what do I do if I can't ever smell my mom's cooking again? If anyone's had their sense of smell came back, please let me know.

No fever. No cough. Pain in the middle of the chest and also in the upper back. The virus sneaked my immune system? Share your experiences, please.	First of all, I'm not a native English Speaker, so forgive me with the grammar. 26 Male without a big health issue. No smoke. No Drugs. No overweight. However, I live in Mexico where the majority of our public health system is trash, so I don't like the idea of being hospitalized if it is necessary. Presumptive positive do the fact that I have a lot of contact with a positive case of Covid like one week ago. I guess that I caught the Covid19 and I would like to read your experiences. This bad feeling started recently, but I had never experienced something like this. Since Tuesday I started to feel an annoyingly thrust in the middle of my chest, but no consistency. No fever. No cough. I thought it was for some food that I ate. At this time I didn't know that the person that have covid was positive. On Wednesday I woke up normally, but at midday suddenly I felt tired, but really really tired. I had to take a lemon tea with a lot of honey to gain energy.

Can you help me understand these test results?	"After getting a nasal swab at my local health department, I just received the results. The body of the email says ""You tested NEGATIVE for Covid 19"". Great. However, then when I click on the PDF of the lab results, it says ""DETECTED"". Does this make sense to anyone? on other websites, I have seen that ""detected"" implies that you tested positive."	"Can you help me understand these test results?

Symptoms and testing questions.	Hi everyone. I have yet to get tested, symptoms started coming on this afternoon. I have a fever of 101, but I don’t feel feverish or have chills, I’m just really clammy. I have a sore throat, fatigue, and GI problems. I assume I probably have COVID but have a few questions What were your early symptoms? What day was the worst? How to know if you need to go to the hospital? How did you mentally calm yourself not to freak out? What does the nose swab feel like?	Symptoms and testing questions. Hi everyone.

I probably have it	I'm 17f and work at a small drive through coffee shop. So one of my coworkers mom tested positive and one of my other coworkers is out waiting to see if her test is positive. Then I stupidly went to a thrift store 3 days ago who apparently had 4 cases of covid recently. Now I have a mild headache, a little fatigue, some nausea and loss of appetite and scratchy throat. I'm working for the next 6 days then have an appointment to get my wisdom teeth out so if I test positive it will screw up everything. how likely is it that i have covid?

Mild Symptoms don't equate to lack of pneumonia - not tested because it's hard to get tested but am positive	I don't need to test to know I'm infected as being in the US it's impossible to get tested, even you have underlying conditions. I'm no longer going to fight for test and just deal with the cards given. We're not sure who infected who, but after traveling, my mother stayed with my sister for a couple of days before quarantine was fully in effect in New York. Both of them had a cough but seemed fine. Fast forward 4 days, my mother came down with a crazy high fever of 101.7 and it's been a battle since. She also developed the beginning stages of pneumonia. My sister also developed pneumonia. I myself got sick. I got a fever once and have been keeping the temperature down since. Aside from the body aches and inability to smell or taste much, I would say I have had pretty okay. I spoke tonmy sister and she said someone with mild symptoms had passed due to ignorance of her pneumonia. She recommended I go get checked. This morning I felt it was a little harder to breathe but I didn't know if it was because she had gotten me paranoid.

Loss of Taste- AGAIN?	I was sick and tested positive early on (end of March/beginning of April). My experience was fairly mild, although the loss of taste/smell I experienced was horrible and lasted about a month. I could not taste anything, not even mouthwash. There have been times here and there where I feel like my taste still isn’t fully what it was but for the most part I have been able to enjoy my food again. However, the past few days, I have noticed I’m really not tasting food like I should be. I made a recipe last night that I’ve made dozens of times and the taste wasn’t right. Has anyone experienced this? I don’t have any nasal congestion. I’m starting to get nervous that this may indicate I have the virus again because this was the first symptom I experienced last time around. However I honestly don’t know where or how I would have gotten it again.	Loss of Taste- AGAIN? I was sick and tested positive early on (end of March/beginning of April).

How persistent is the cough?	Hey guys. So I'm living with someone right now.. We have seperate rooms. They haven't been out (neither have I) much since the pandemic except to buy groceries (their last trip was about 13 days ago, I ordered mine). They've been having this cough all week. But it was just once or twice every few hours. But this morning, their sibling (who's now staying with us bc school closed) has been coughing more frequently. They've been coughing like once or twice every 5 minutes. How persistent is the COVID cough? How do I know if I'm overthinking or not?	How persistent is the cough? Hey guys.

Question for the Long Timers	I'm trying to determine when exactly I got infected and how long this may last for me. Trying to keep positive, but these ups and downs are brutal. Anyways, I had a fever, for a day, in late February and then felt perfectly fine. My husband was terribly sick for a week after this, but we just assumed flu or infection since this was before Covid was really a thing where we live. When I say a was fine, I was 100% - never would've suspected anything was wrong. And then on April 15th (6 weeks after the fever) I went downhill fast. Shortness of breath, chest tightness, extreme fatigue, elevated d dimer, scary low potassium levels, neurological issues, etc. These have ebbed and flowed since mid April, but I'm still struggling. My doctors now are realizing it is Covid and possibly an inflammatory response or post viral response since my body did seem to fight off the actual virus well. But, this boggles my mind. Did anyone else have almost no symptoms at all after being infected and then get so much worse weeks after? Any insight as to why this would happen?

Potentially infected, wondering about anti inflammatories	So I’ve been boosting my immunity since lockdown to prepare for a potential exposure, I live in the east Bay and based off the general vibe of the public, I’ve thought I might inevitably come into contact. These months have been a roller coaster for sure, First round of symptoms was stress, second round was allergies, but his last week I’ve been volunteering and active in the community, Im kicking myself for being in situations this week that looking back were definitely dangerous to be in. Since Friday I think I’ve had brief instances of SOB...I’ve been doing breathing exercises since the beginning and in the past two days it seems a little harder to bring in air at times. Today I went a small walk and I am feeling fatigued and little dizzy, have been walking consistently in Lockdown And it’s the first time I’ve felt this way.

Is the gym safe? I have really bad anxiety about being in public spaces other than the grocery store.	I had Covid really bad in July, hospitalized, and I’m understandably having severe anxiety about public interactions. I don’t really go anywhere except target or the grocery store. I really want to get back to the gym, but I’m terrified of contracting the virus again. I have antibodies, but there’s no proof those provide immunity to the virus itself. What’s the consensus on going back to an environment like the gym? Just want some opinions from others in the same boat. Thanks!	Is the gym safe?

Hi everyone,	I am Prashant from Nepal and currently I am stuck in New Delhi, India for my mother’s cancer treatment (breast and ovary). And as you all know, cases in India is increasing rapidly and contracting covid would be absolute worst for my mum right now. She had three chemo and a major surgery. Going into three more. We are trying our best to take precautions but it is hard in crowded India where people really do not seem to care much. And the conditions are really unsanitary to begin with. I would really like to hear some cases of how covid19 positive folks from this subreddit caught the virus so that I can take precautions against that. I am going absolutely insane hearing all the stories and knowing the virus is slowly just surrounding us. Please help us fight this. And i really hope all of you will get back to being yourselves soon. This virus seems to really really suck.

Interesting turn of events	So I just got word that I have tested positive for COVID, along with my Grandma, sister, brother in law and Mother. I'm not sure how my Grandma got exposed. We don't see her very much but who knows at this point. It just blows my mind that we all have it! Nobody has intense symptoms or anything too scary. Just feels like a bad cold, my brother in law has such mild symptoms he's barely being held down by this virus like us. But I'm starting to feel out of breath alot so I'm a little concerned.

Is it worth going in at day 25?	I’m a presumed case, 34F on day 25. 130lbs, history of moderate bronchial issues. I was doing great for a week and my symptoms seem to have reactivates around day 17.

Here I am, chest pains, dizziness, breathless in between sentences. Is it worth going in? Or should I just ride this thing out. Haven’t been tested as I was told I was no critical enough. Wondering if it’s worth the cost to go in. Thoughts?	Is it worth going in at day 25? I’m a presumed case, 34F on day 25. 130lbs, history of moderate bronchial issues.

Should I still wait the 10 days before I interact with others?	On 9/5 I got hit with a fever. This peaked the next day, 9/6 where it went up to 104 and I was so tired. Like I had negative energy. I couldn’t even get the remote to change the channel. On 9/7 it was slightly better, but still around 101-102. On 9/8 it went away at some point during the day and I have felt fine ever since (I never had any other symptoms but the fever/muscle ache). On 9/9 (4 days after the start of the fever, but no fever at this point) I was tested for coronavirus as my doctor figured it was coronavirus. On 9/11 I was confirmed negative. Should I still wait the 10 days before I emerge from my house? I really don’t know what else caused a fever for days, but the test was negative. My doctor has never actually called me to tell me the results, I just happened to find it through the online portal.	Should I still wait the 10 days before I interact with others?

I slept over my sister’s house last night, and she had told me that she had gone to the hospital 2 days before to visit her grandfather. I was a little freaked out after she said that, because hospitals aren’t really the place to be right now. I noticed she was coughing, but she assured me she was alright. I came home today and felt like my head started burning up. I checked my temperature, and I was only 98.1 — I checked it about an hour later as well, and it was 97.4. This means my temp is normal, but I still don’t feel right. Maybe I’m just being paranoid but I want to ask anyways. I’ve heard symptoms show as early as 2 days, but can anyone confirm if that is inarguably accurate info? Can there be symptoms that show about ~20 hours after?

Loss of taste	So I’ve been having symptoms all week from Monday till about Thursday morning I had a fever and body aches, the classic sickness feeling whatever and then after that the fever went away and then Thursday night I started feeling the cough and lost my smell and taste. Now it’s Friday night not coughing anymore but I can’t taste or smell and I’m just wondering if anybody else that had this symptom could tell me how long the no taste or smell lasted. It’s definitely the most annoying part of this. I haven’t gotten my test back yet (I got tested Tuesday) but some people who I have been around tested positive so it’s very obvious I have the virus. I’m just wondering how long this symptom lasted for y’all cuz it’s super annoying, I think I’d rather take the fever back and have my senses lol. Stay strong everybody!

My nose feels runny. I’m terrified. [Question-to those who tested positive]	Many reasons it could be running. I cried today. My air conditioner does that sometimes and also makes me sneeze occasionally. I’m just a tiny bit tired, which can be due to my rigorous study routine and the resultant exhaustion. I have no other symptoms except a slight sensation of dryness and heat at the back of my nose. I can’t tell if they’re normal everyday symptoms or Covid. I have been taking many many precautions very regularly.	My nose feels runny. I’m terrified. [Question-to those who tested positive] Many reasons it could be running. I cried today.

Wondering about initial symptoms	Ive been experiencing a few mild symptoms that correlate to COVID-19 and I'm wondering if any of you experienced these at all? TL:DR - Nausea, mild headache, dizziness - possible starter symptoms of the virus or is my body doing something else?😂 -Ive been having mild to moderate headaches. Pretty consistent and advil doesn't seem to touch it. Hasn't affected my vision at all -I've been coughing at random. But just ONE cough. It feels like I need to hack up a lung, then I'll cough once and im fine for hours-days. -Dizziness galore. I've been super dizzy. I do have a history of vertigo, but I haven't had it in a while. -Nausea. I've had pretty bad nausea for the past couple days. The first day i was also shakey but I thought that was because of the nausea. They usually go hand in hand for me. -Ive also been super tired for the past week - more than normal. I do work a full time job and have been working more hours this week due to taking time off next week. So im not sure if thats just it?

Headache and exhaustion	I'm getting tested tomorrow but I am just wondering if anyone felt exhaustion as a first symptom? I have been wasted since Friday, where I am going to bed at 7:30 and still wake up exhausted. The past 3 days I've been having headaches but I chalked it up to weather changes. However today the headache has been worse, there is no rain in the forecast and now my jaw really hurts. It's just radiating, feels like sinus but also my jaw (I tried to eat something crunchy and my head throbbed more). Also right before this all started I had an diet coke and it didn't taste like anything, and for most of just one day things just tasted bland. Now I'm fine with smell and taste but my headache and exhaustion is just growing.

What is the probability of a false positive.	It’s pretty common that the percentage of false negatives vary based on certain conditions. But, I haven’t read anywhere about the possibility of false positives, is there any research which shows that the probability for a false positive PCR Swab test.

My timeline of being Covid19 positive	33, F. East TN. I have asthma and complex sleep apnea. 09/12 - woke up with a dry cough. No fever. Went about my day thinking it was a sinus infection. 09/13 - full on congestion. Cough has died down. Temp reached 100.0° in late evening. Checked two hours after and it’s back down to 97.5°. 09/14 - Wake up, check temp. 98°. Think it’s definitely a sinus infection. Go to work. Around noon I go grab lunch from cafeteria. Upon eating I realize I can’t taste any of it. Normally our hospital cafeteria is pretty bland. I salt and pepper my food. Realize still can’t taste it. My anxiety goes into over drive. I pick up some lotion that always gives me a headache. I can’t smell it. I realize I probably have Covid. Contact ER director about protocol. I’m asked to leave hospital premises and get tested.

What were you first symptoms?	So I’ve been experiencing some burning in chest (mild) took a Allegra and was better the next day. Today I woke up with a headache that would not go away even with extra strength Tylenol. No other symptoms other than a scratchy throat and the headache. I didn’t get much sleep last night not becuase of symptoms. Not sure what to think. My boyfriend was exposed to his sister who might be positive. He has been with me since 6/11. He is showing no symptoms and neither has his sister. I’ve been feeling not bad but not normal the last few days. Could this be the virus? Should I get tested? I’m a hypochondriac to top it off.

Day 3 of Intubation	They Intubated my grandma on Sunday, she was already in the hospital for seven days before that. Her situation hasn’t gotten better, her blood pressure has to be stabilized with two different medications. Her organs are failing, liver, kidneys, and lungs. She’s at the max of the ventilator. They called me today with a few options that my mother and grandfather(both of them are also hospitalized) couldn’t come to. Option 1: to continue doing what they are doing Option 2: if her heart stops to not resuscitate her Option 3: to stop what they’re doing and let her pass I want to go with option 1 because I want her to continue fighting no matter what. But I also don’t want her to suffer, is there anyone who’s had a shit situation with COVID come back positive?

For those with a mild case, how did your symptoms first start?	For context: F(22), no underlying health conditions and living in an area where cases are rising Beginning of this week, I started feeling a slight sore throat. My right tonsil was more inflamed and red than my left one and there is a visible white “balloon.” I say it’s a ballon because it’s bigger than just a dot and I can see that it may have some type of liquid in it? Started getting small headaches which I took Tylenol to alleviate. Was concerned I may have gotten the virus and scheduled a test through CVS. I went a day after experiencing those symptoms. Not sure if I did it right, I just shoved it in as far as I can and tried swabbing the entire nose cavity. I’m still waiting on those results. Two days after, I went to urgent care to get a strep test. Test came back negative for strep so they swabbed the back of my throat for COVID19. I just got my results in today saying that it’s negative. But I’ve been having very loose stool, headaches, slight chills, and my entire body is extremely sore. Is it possible that I tested too early? Thanks	For those with a mild case, how did your symptoms first start?

Disgusting mouldy/ dusty smell and taste and furry tongue. Have you had this and what happened?	"Last month, I lost my sense of smell and taste out of nowhere for two weeks. Other than that, I had the occasional headache but that's probably stress-related. . However, for the past few days, this awful smell has been following me around. The products I use in my hair smelled like plastic. I walked into my living room and smelled what I thought was mould, then realised it was the same smell as my hair. Bottles of shampoo and body wash smell like they have expired. It's hard to describe, but some food tastes mouldy. A banana smoothie tasted like soap. My toes are cold, my tongue feels furry and I generally feel ""off"". I have not been put forward for testing yet but I'm really concerned for my parents as I live with them. Covid-positives, did you experience this? Was it at the beginning or end of your illness?"	"Disgusting mouldy/ dusty smell and taste and furry tongue. Have you had this and what happened?

Worried about parents? (50s)	I’ve been super anxious about my parents getting the virus. They’re in their early to mid 50s and both are in shape and in good health, but I’m still really concerned. I’m a college student who has been doing everything I can to keep from getting sick, but I still feel really bad whenever I go home in fear of giving them the virus. Does anyone have any experience with otherwise healthy, 50s aged adults getting the virus??	Worried about parents? (50s) I’ve been super anxious about my parents getting the virus.

SOB Onset Question (23M)	It started with sore throat on Tuesday and by Wednesday I had most of the non-respiratory symptoms (fever, headache, chills, muscle aches). Tested positive that day and could barely move with how crappy I felt. Yesterday and today the symptoms were much more manageable and my temp has been normal. I have noticed a loss of smell and a burning sensation in my nose, however. I know SOB usually develops ~5-7 days but I’m curious whether I’m less likely to get it given that the other symptoms have diminished already. I’m primarily concerned about SOB because I know it can strike pretty quickly and I live alone. Just hoping for some perspective.

Dry throat for days, occasional coughs	Hi guys, It all started all of a sudden on Friday as I was driving to spend a few days on a vacation with my GF. I felt that itchy feeling in my throat that makes you clear it every few minutes. From that moment on (4 days ago), up until now, I still have it and I sometimes have to cough too. I also have a feeling that my throat is being extremely dry when I breathe. My nose is slightly runny sometimes and I also sneeze every now end then but this is going on since spring started. I've been measuring my body temp. a couple of times a day and the highest I measured was 37C in the afternoon (I measure my body temp. since the start of the Covid-19 thing and it ranges from 36.2 @ 6 A.M to 36.8-9 @ 6 P.M. Are those symptoms worrisome in your opinion as I am starting to panic a bit. Every time I get a cold I get this dry throat thing but it only lasts for a day and then I get sick. Now its been 4 days without any other symptoms appearing.

Airway Clearance Breathing Techniques ACBT to help clear your lungs more efficiently.	Hi Everyone, This is something I feel people should know about especially since the effort of coughing is so draining on the body. This technique is taught by Physio’s to help you clear your secretions in the lungs. Breathing Control (BC): This is your normal breathing rate and volume, try breathing with the lower chest using your diaphragm, keeping your shoulders and upper chest relaxed. This is used to allow you to recover from the more active parts of the techniques relieves breathlessness, oxygen desaturation and bronchospasm. Thoracic Expansion Exercises (TEE): These are deep breathing exercises where you focus on the slow and controlled inspiration through your nose. This helps open the the collateral channels of breathing in the alveoli and helps the air get around the secretions. You may want to try a 3 second hold at the end of the breath with the throat open to further increase the ability for the air to get around these secretions. Limit the Forced expansions exercises to 3-4 times. If you need to you can intersperse the TEE with BC. Forced Expiration Technique (FET) This is the combination of two forced breaths out called huffs. The first breath is from a	Airway Clearance Breathing Techniques ACBT to help clear your lungs more efficiently.

Dad is on comfort care.	For those following my story, thank you for all the wishes, prayers and good vibes. My father, Jesus Flores, received plasma Wednesday and it didn’t change his condition. He has been in the hospital for a month and been on the ventilator as well. As we speak my family is using facetime in the living room to talk him through til he passes. All he does is open his eyes and does not respond. They tried everything to get him to but he just won’t. A nurse with hospice care is continuing to give him morphine so he does not feel pain. Im locked in my room because i refuse to see my father that way. I dont want that to be my last memory, i made sure to say my goodbyes prior. He is 54 and no underlying conditions. My worst fear came true today and I’m in immense pain. A man who was in my life for all 22 years of my life is about to leave me..everyone stay safe and thank you all for following. ❤️	Dad is on comfort care.

Others still feeling fatigue after 3 weeks?	"I keep thinking I've put this illness behind me, only to get hit the next day with more fatigue. I see that others have experienced the same roller-coaster pattern of symptoms like I have. But I wonder - do some people also feel this pattern keeps going even as most symptoms fade away? I know there's a great variety of symptoms, person to person. And I assume some people go from ""sick"" to ""healthy"" pretty abruptly.

I don’t know what to do after being sick	Me(22) Mom(56) My mom was a bit sick on July 1st so we decided to go get tested on July 2nd and we got our results on July 8th positive. Same day we got tested I started feeling feverish, I had a sore throat and felt weak. I went to sleep. Next couple of days were the same. My mom was the same as me but was coughing. I had no cough which was weird. Anyways I got my period July 4-9 and started having diarrhea (which is usually normal). I had diarrhea since then (it’s kind of going back to normal, lol sorry tmi) and mom would throw up a lot. Our fever went away I believe around July 14 but I started coughing and smelling some weird smells. I don’t think I lost my sense of smell or taste but I just randomly have these nasty smells I think it’s the phlegm, idk. We are soon going to go get tested again but I’m waiting for all the symptoms to fully leave.

For those of you who have been scared to work out once you started feeling better, I just completed a CrossFit workout on day 9 of having covid. Read about my results:	So I’ve been on my own personal cocktail of 500mg of vitamin C a day, 500mg of Tylenol when the pain or fever showed up and multivitamins every day. Every day there was a new symptom I had to deal with until day 8. On day 8 the only symptom I was showing was a small cough and tiny aches. On day 9 all I had was a small cough. So today (day 10) I tried to complete a CrossFit workout. I went about 50% max effort, nothing crazy and almost immediately felt my muscles in my legs begin to cramp and then tire out. The strain was intense despite the easy workout. And then after the workout the small cough was more present with deep breaths. Nearly every deep breath I coughed. In conclusion, I didn’t die, but I definitely need to take it easier even going 50%. You can work out, just start small and slow and build yourself into it. My symptoms haven’t regressed, but I felt them more immediately after.

I wore a mask, social distanced &amp; still got it!	I was feeling really sick around 3:30pm Sept 21 and took a nap between 4:30pm-7:30pm. I woke up and felt like my body got hit by a truck. During my full time of quarantine I hit pretty much every single symptom on the covid list. A lot of friends were skeptical and kept telling me it was the flu. I got tested at a CVS on the 22nd and it was a “do it yourself” test. I had two doctor appointments over the week and they basically told me I 100% had covid. My test came back on Saturday and it came back negative. So everyone that had to quarantine due to me was over the moon, but it didn’t sit well with me. Yes, I could definitely have the flu, but why would my doctor tell me it’s definitely covid? So that same Saturday, I went to get tested. This time a doctor swabbed me and I highly recommend going to somewhere that swabs you. I did not go as far into my nasal wall as they did. I got my results Sunday morning and it came back positive.

I've noticed if I am prone (laying on my stomach) the cough isn't as often where was if I stand up or sit up I cough more often. Also I feel like I want to claw at my throat, it's not itchy or ""sore"" but kinda feels like a burning sensation almost, this just started today. Maybe some slight inflammation of the airway maybe?

Virtual visit with a doctor for allergies and now they want to test for COVID-19	I’ve been having allergy symptoms for a week.

Returning to work after being sick (presumed positive) and out of work since March 30th - feeling nervous. How has returning to work gone for others?	Hello, a quick recap of my (23F) experience. I began experiencing symptoms on March 30th with fever and extreme fatigue and progressing to a dry cough, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate and palpitations and muscle weakness. I went and got tested the next day, but the test was poorly administers (felt like a flu swab, not deep) and came back negative. The doctor at the test center stated that based on my symptoms I am a presumed positive case. By the end of week two I was feeling much worse. Week 3 briefly looked up and then I felt much worse and ended up at the ER at the end of the week. I was misdiagnosed with bronchitis as the PA misdocumented my symptoms and put down symptoms that I wasn't experiencing and left out symptoms I was. I was retested for Corona-virus which came back negative. My primary care doctor was telling me that she has seen several cases similar to mine. She does not currently have access to antibody testing and my other labs came back normal. As of the start of this week, I have been fever free and my shortness of breath has lessened to	Returning to work after being sick (presumed positive) and out of work since March 30th - feeling nervous.

I was retested for Corona-virus which came back negative. My primary care doctor was telling me that she has seen several cases similar to mine. She does not currently have access to antibody testing and	0

Timeline of my numerous symptoms, any thoughts?	July 17th Early morning: I woke up with some mild nausea and diarrhea July 18-21st: Little to no symptoms besides mild allergy like annoyances such as sneezing, runny nose, and some slight mucus in the throat. July 22nd: I sprung awake at around 9am with horrible nausea and stomach cramps and proceeded to sprint to the bathroom In a daze where I then began to violently spew liquid from both ends. After this I returned to my bed and began to experience fatigue, chills, and the continuing nausea and stomach cramps. I slept most of the day getting up often to poop more water. July 23rd: No more vomiting or chills but still having diarrhea occasionally. Found it difficult to eat with the nausea July 24-25th: Felt absolutely fine with no memorable symptoms July 26th: Back to the same feeling as the 22nd minus the vomiting. However I began to feel much worse and started to develop a sore throat, the occasional headache, and I even began to almost feel kind of in a trance or confused I guess you could say. July 27th: Still getting worse except now I feel as I'm extremely dehydrated. I have yet to have	Timeline of my numerous symptoms, any thoughts?

Did any of you get covid being totally isolated? Not working, grocery delivery, etc.	I’ve had some weird GI symptoms such as vomiting and belching/reflux and sore throat, but we really can’t figure out how I could’ve gotten something. We live in a somewhat rural house on some land, get grocery delivery and wash them, and we all work from home. We’ve had no interaction with anyone. A lot of people say oh we only go to the grocery store or only go to work but we haven’t even done that. I also have antibodies and had the virus in March so maybe it could possibly be a long term complication	Did any of you get covid being totally isolated?

Home test	I've totally messed up my home test. I definitely didn't reach my tonsils with the swab, and I took the test before I registered it and now it says not to take on a Sunday due to the post not being available. I didn't realize I was meant to post on the same day. And when I try to register it I just get an error message constantly. My current symptoms seem to be mostly cold like. Headache, sleepy, sore throat, heavy eyes. No cough or high temperature. Is it likely that I even have it? And do I need to order a new test? Thanks	Home test I've totally messed up my home test.

Tested positive, 100% asymptomatic... no QT??	I tested positive after traveling for work. I tested negative a few days BEFORE leaving. It was a two week trip and I monitored myself carefully and took my temp every day. Upon returning I waiting 5 days and then went for a test just for piece of mind. I was shocked to find out I was positive. The physicians said that because I was asymptomatic that I was cleared to return to work with no quarantine the next day. So... is it safe for me to be around my family? Go to appointments? Grocery stores? I’m just very afraid of being irresponsible. Has anyone else had this experience?

Upper back pain and a positive test?	Hello! Thankful for a place to be able to ask these sort of questions and get super informative responses. 3 days ago, I started feeling iffy. I was chilly one night, tickle in my throat, super tired. I am terrified of getting covid (I live with my parents and am especially concerned for them) so my initial thought was oh no its coming. Took temp, no fever. Chills went away, but still have this lingering cough/throat issue. Almost like a constant need to clear my throat? I am assuming this will become a full blown cough. HOWEVER the weird symptom today is back pain. Day 4/5 of potential symptoms. Its right between my shoulder blades, almost feels muscular yet I havent worked out recently. It also feels connected to my throat when I clear it. Has anyone tested positive with the back issue? Trying to get a drive through test this week.	Upper back pain and a positive test? Hello!

People that I know with Covid19 (part 2)	Hello everyone, so I’m in Montreal and plenty of people I know from the same neighborhood got Covid19 in half-September because they were always with each other and lives near each other. 6 Families = ≈55 people. Age range = 8 to 60 years They are all fine and tested - after 2-3 weeks, mild symptoms for all of them except the 8 year old no symptoms, most fever and some cough and fatigue and body aches but no other dangerous complication. Hope it can help some anxious people, yes it can be dangerous but most of the time you will not die but it’s not a reason to not being careful. Please wash your hand always and don’t touche your face when you are outside and always wear a mask. Take care everyone.

My spring allergies are absent while I continue to fight this off (day 38), anyone else notice this?	I've been off and on sick (mostly sick) since March 12, like many have described on here with waves of this illness. One thing I've noticed is that my normal springtime allergies which typically really take a toll on me starting in March, have been completely absent this spring. I suspect it's because my body is actively fighting off a real threat, and isn't instead targeting pollen, dust, other allergens, which my ammune system typically overreacts to.

Infected friday April 3rd? Tested positive monday the 6th. Would I for sure be able to tell if I develop pneumonia?	I'm a 23 year old male, regular build. No known health issues or conditions of any sort. My first symptom would have been a headache on saturday april 4th, developing the next few days into a scratchy throat, migraine, chills, loss of taste and smell, and joint aches basically in that order. Until thursday,(4/9 yesterday) it seems I've ditched every other symptom (except the loss of taste and smell) for shortness of breath. I've never had pneumonia so I'm just wondering if I would know for sure if I were to get it? Havent really had a cough throughout the course of this and still am not coughing.

26 F - day by day symptoms and recovery	I wanted to post my experience here to give thanks to this sub which was immensely useful when I tested positive. I’m 26, F and healthy with no underlying conditions except maybe a history of bronchitis Day 1: Started with what I thought was a routine sinus headache and some ear pain. I also lost all smell and maybe 25% of my taste. Day 2: headache and fever (got tested) Day 3: sore throat has developed overnight but fever and headache are greatly reduced (got positive result back) Day 4: sore throat is better and other symptoms are also milder Day 5: fever gone.

Chest pain 30/m	I am pretty sure I have this thing and I’m getting tested tomorrow morning. I had bloodshot eyes and post nasal drip as my first symptoms and then I started getting chest pain. I can’t tell if it’s gas or my heart but it’s freaking me out pretty bad. I am reading about people having heart failure with this. I’m only two days in so it will probably get worse. Does anyone have any ideas or heard from medical sources what this chest pain is? Because if people are having heart failure then couldn’t it very easily be something going wrong with the heart. And if so, how common is it to have a heart attack with coronavirus? I’m aware probably no one knows these things but just checking.

Feel like I'm going to die from COVID or my mind.	I'll preface by saying I have really bad health anxiety / hypochondria after watching my grandfather pass away a couple of years ago. I have taken COVID seriously since the beginning. I avoided going out, wore/wear a mask, hand sanitize outside/hand wash inside. The past month I got a little antsy and started seeing friends at parks (we don't touch each other, just kick a soccer ball, throw a frisbee/football and use sanitizer). My friends all have high risk parents and quarantine like I do. This past weekend we did the same but had a small picnic as well and everything was fine. I am 25. However, the last 2 days, I've been feeling not 100%. I am overweight (BMI 34) and ate out and drank quite a bit during this past weekend. I was having some chest burning (I have previous issues with GERD and it felt like heartburn). I also felt like I needed some extra effort to breathe for a bit (now the feeling is gone). My body has been hot and then normal for the past 2 days (not abnormal, I run hot usually especially at night time).

Should I get tested ? Doctor said no	So last Thursday I took a bath at night and slept with my hair wet and the a/c on all night . Friday I was ok , then Saturday afternoon I started coughing a little I and Sunday morning woke up with a sore throat and I blamed the day I slept with the ac on . Monday I felt the same couldn’t talk much and my throat felt swollen I spoke to my doctor and he said that unless I have a fever or muscle pain I shouldn’t get tested and prescribed ibuprofen , I live in Mexico and the PCR test is way to expensive so I decided to wait (also I don’t trust the rapid test because of a lot of people I know that tested positive or negative then the PCR told another story).

Shortness of breath	So I’ve had symptoms for a week now. I haven’t been tested since I’m trying to stay away from people. Currently I have moments where it’s hard to breath, and moments where it’s easier to breath. I’ve had chills and cold sweats but no fever. I had strange coughing fit yesterday but I haven’t really experienced much dry cough. It feels like it’s covid but I’m just taking a guess. I’d say my fourth or fifth day were the worst in terms of breathing. I’ve been using a pulse box that I had laying around and my O2 levels stay at a constant 98/99. Anyone have a similar experience here?	Shortness of breath So I’ve had symptoms for a week now. I haven’t been tested since I’m trying to stay away from people.

[26F] Post-viral fatigue and confusion: how to treat it?	Hi guys, my girlfriend \[26F\] has recovered from covid-19 and now she feels really tired, just to give some timeline: * Onset of symptoms: July 1st * Hospitalized: about week later (July 8-9) * Discharged: somewhere July 20-22 * Got tested negative: July 23 So, it's been 1 month of her dealing with all this shit. And now, she feels scared because she's almost always feeling tired, she tried to go for a walk and felt really tired and went back home. I was thinking maybe it's because of too much antibiotics that been injected into her body when she was at the hospital. She doesn't have any other complaints except having sometimes a body temperature of 98.5-99F. And the problem is in 1-2 weeks she will need to go back to work. So how to deal with this? What should she do to get better?	[26F] Post-viral fatigue and confusion: how to treat it?

Lingering issues post covid	Started out as a mild cold that was annoying, lots of congestion and lethargy and then turned into gasping for breath,painful coughing that produced nothing and massive weight loss, Diarrhea and strangely a horrible bout of anxiety and depression? Was curious if anyone else came out the other end with mental health issues? I was unaware I had covid while battling it so I wasn’t worried about it during. Another thing is any sort of smoke in my household from cooking seems to irritate my lungs months after recovering. Has anyone else experienced these issues?

My experience as a middle-class worker with COVID-19 in a 3rd world country	I'm a 25 year old male who works in an office that actually adapted really well to the new normal standards for workplace safety. Every corner of the office has an alcohol dispenser, going in and out if the office requires us to pass through thermal scanning doors, we minimized manual processes to prevent physical contacts, we have acrylic glass shields on every desk, we had a questionnaire that we needed to answer everyday to monitor our wellbeing, and they even provided shuttle services for employees so we won't take our country's horrible public transportation service everyday. All these precautionary measures are kinda hindered by the fact that our government leaders here haven't been the best in managing this crisis. Citizens like me are frustrated cos we need the money but that means we need go out and expose ourselves to the risk of getting the disease. Local government wasn't helpful, really. Pointless ordinances are being implemented and cases here are still rising. I don't see it coming down in the near future. So here I am now on my 4th day of quarantine in my room.

They were negative, I was positive. So far this week, my only symptom has been a cough. I lost got a decreased taste for about 20 minutes sunday night, and my smell and taste was 90% gone on tuesday night for about 2 hours. Other than that, I haven't experienced anything else. I'm wondering if I can feel confident that I'm safe, or if I can still expect to be knocked down by some symptoms. I'm 20m.

Anxious	My boyfriend tested positive for COVID today, so I know for sure I’m going to test positive too. Doctor is having me get a test tomorrow. I have insane anxiety and I’m really really scared about this virus and what it’s going to do to my body. Can anyone help put my mind at ease?

What's the longest someone has been in the hospital for Covid?	I posted earlier about how we were worried for our friend who has been in the hospital for covid for over 11 weeks. We were able to get in contact with his family and they said they are in touch with the hospital and he is getting better slowly but now the question for us what is the longest someone has been in the hospital? The wait seems to be endless. I am wondering if there are any more cases of people being in hospital for more than 11 weeks. :(	What's the longest someone has been in the hospital for Covid?

Only one in household positive for antibodies.	My parents both got sick in late January early Feb after one of their coworkers came back from a trip to China. All the symptoms for Covid-19 and almost had to take my mom to the ER. I was curious to see if we had it so I went and took the LabCorp Abbott antibody test last week. Surprisingly I came back positive for antibodies although I never showed symptoms. My mom went just the other day but hers came back negative. Any theories?

Of those who have tested positive - were you disinfecting your groceries, packages, and mail?	I only by groceries as of the late that can be hit disnfectant spray safely (packaged and/or safe to clean). The packages you get from the infection-ridden amazon centers need to be sanitized on the INSIDE of the shipping package, as that is where it was handled by all the Amazon employees. The exterior is exposed to UV rays from the sun usually, but I still recommend disinfecting the exterior as well. Is anyone else doing this? I feel like this should be something we all do - what is your opinion on the subject? I use a Lysol-type spray on non-food items, and use an ethanol-based spray on foods items.

My family had covid at home months ago, I think I need anxiety support	(I clarify that this post is mostly about emotions, I think I need to hear people that have gone through the same as my family) Hi! I'm 26 and my father had COVID during the beginning of May. It was the most stressful time of my life because my mom and my aunt grandmother have risk factors. The rest of us were told (we live in Chile) to not get tested unless we developed serious symptoms. We didn't. I had cold-like symptoms though, mainly nasal congestion, cough with phlegm that lasted a while and a mild pain in the ribs for like two days. I actually went to have myself tested at a clinic, I had an appointment booked and when I went there the guys were out of tests. I realized that I didn't want to go back to the hospital if they were gonna fail me like that again. Everyone in my family turned out fine, they don't develop any symptoms at all, we recover and that's it. So time goes by, a month of me feeling fine passes. During this time I begin to feel ultralucky to be alive, appreciating of things, but then more and more	My family had covid at home months ago, I think I need anxiety support (I clarify that this post is mostly about emotions, I think I need to hear people that have gone through the same as my family) Hi!

Is it true that Hospitals are admitting false Covid patients and illegally harvesting organs?	A few of my distant relatives have died due to COVID. Every other day we hear news from some relatives that Hospitals are not only looting people, but also admitting them on false Covid positive and of they die (or maybe killed), they removed their organs. It's no lie that there are wayyy more people getting infected and dying than the govt. records.	Is it true that Hospitals are admitting false Covid patients and illegally harvesting organs?

How quickly did you go about cancelling plans once you started developing symptoms?	I was planning on visiting a friend tomorrow to try on/potentially buy her wedding dress. We both have had small quarantine pods (me: my girlfriend and my roommate, her: her boyfriend). Our quarantine pods are insular, meaning we only interact with each other. However, I live in a big city, so exposure to people is inevitable when walking down the street and going grocery shopping. Today, I started feeling achey, had a headache, and measured a 99.9 degree fever. It was 11pm I took my temperature, but the appt tomorrow is at 8:30am. I obviously haven’t gotten tested, because this was day 1 of symptoms, so I don’t know I have it. Did anyone else have to handle a situation like this?

Blood Clots	Hi guys, I am starting to suspect I have blood clots. I've had a very mild cough and brought blood up in my sputum. When I cough I can't explain it, but what is that noise like a deep sound when you cough? If you know what I mean? As if mucus is trapped? Also I've had tightness and feelings of trouble breathing/anxiety. Also I have random dull pains across my lungs and I've had some bouts of dizziness. Does this sound blood-clot-like? Thanks	Blood Clots Hi guys, I am starting to suspect I have blood clots. I've had a very mild cough and brought blood up in my sputum.

Long-termers convalescent plasma donation	I 've registered at the blood transfusion centre to potentially donate convalescent plasma. I haven't had an antibody test as they are currently banned in England (I know), but they would test me and assess if I'm eligible for a donation in the centre. If I do have antibodies I would gladly do it to at least make my horrid experience potentially useful for someone else. They'll call me and do the assessment within the next couple of weeks. However, I'm a little worried as I did have symptoms for 9 weeks and only symptom free for maybe a week or so now. I am worried that plasma donation could trigger another relapse or fatigue, so I'm wondering if any of you other recovered long-termers donated plasma and what your experience was like. Although I got so used to being sick for weeks that I almost don't care if I get another wave of symptoms if it's because I do something useful but at least I would like to know what to expect. Perhaps someone with ME/CFS could advise as well because the condition seems relevant to our experience.

For those who frequently gets sinus infections and bronchitus pre-Covid19	I get a sinus infection every couple of months. It starts out with a soreness in my throat, then my sinuses are runny and then become clogged with mucus that is yellowish only after a few days, the drainage goes into my lungs and I'm coughing up yellow/green chunks, and then the pressure in my face gets insanely bad. This will usually go on for weeks unless I go in and get antibiotics. I know other people have reoccurring sinus infections, so I'm wondering how those of you with this problem have been affected by Covid-19 and if there's any similarities. The part that concerns me the most is the inability to get over the infection within a month without antibiotics.

Prophylaxis with Vitamin C, D, and Quercetin - an anecdotal experience	My fiance, who I live with, got a fever and dry cough starting last Monday, and tested positive last Wednesday. I have been taking vitamin C (Emergen-C), Vitamin D, and Quercetin on a semi-daily basis since March. I started to get a headache last Friday (two days after my fiance tested positive and still showing peak symptoms). My primary care doctor ordered me a test, which came out negative. Fast forward to now. My headache went away and I have virtually no symptoms. I have not taken another test, but my doctor said I can take one later this week if my symptoms come back. The doc was surprised at the negative result -- I was in extremely close proximity to an infected person for multiple days. I told her about the supplements I was taking, but she seemed to think supplements don't do anything at all. My fiance started taking the same set of supplements this weekend and began to feel much better within a day or so. Currently, she has a slight cough and no fever. Hope this information helps. Please try not to draw any sweeping conclusions from this.

Possible Reinfection?	Tested positive back in early April, no clue where I got exposed as I was strictly quarantining since early March. Had the usual rundown of symptoms - loss of smell/taste, chest tightness, headaches. Recovered a few weeks later and tested negative in early May then positive for antibodies in late May and late June. Went on a vacation last week (drove a few hours away) and made sure to wear a mask/sanitize. Where I was at you had to wear masks even when socially distant on the street so I thought I would be okay. Fast forward to yesterday and the chest tightness has returned, along with a pretty bad fatigue and lingering headache. Got tested yesterday but looking at a 10 day window for the results. Anybody experience a true reinfection (a la tested positive, then negative then positive again after having antibodies somewhere along the line)?	Possible Reinfection?

Pulse Oximeter causing anxiety	Hi everyone! I’m (29M, healthy) Having a bit of health anxiety over my pulse oximeter readings. I’m actually on day 24 of my covid sickness, and still suffering from some symptoms (pretty mild at this point, just fatigue, and a bit of a stuffy nose). I feel pretty weak in the mornings. I’ve also noticed a bit of wheezing when I breath in super deep, and I brought out my pulse oximeter again. It’s freaking me out because I’m normally at 97-99 and now I’m at 94-95 (but will randomly drop to 92, up to 98. It’s worth noting it’s a random pulse ox I bought OTC in Mexico.

Asymptomatic but still positive. Struggling.	I tested positive for a test taken on 5/29, found out on 6/2. I probably had symptoms for that first week but they went away pretty fast. I felt so great all last week, but needed to get retested in order to return to work. Went to a clinic on Friday and finally got results from it today, and I’m still positive! I thought I was stressed out before. I’m more stressed knowing that I’m asymptomatic at this point but am still testing positive. It’s very frustrating. I live with 3 other people and only one other tested positive. I don’t know what to do at this point. I probably have to start filing for unemployment. Not to mention it’s starting to take a toll on my mental health. I can’t do anything about this and that’s what scares me.	Asymptomatic but still positive. Struggling.

My covid-19 progression with two periods of illness over a total of 5 weeks	So my story is pretty old by now, but I just found this sub so I thought I'd share it. &amp;#x200B; I'm a 34 year old male in Stockholm, Sweden who rarely get sick. I work in a lab in one of our main hospitals, so I'm an essential worker. I travel to work by subway and commuter train. I also have a pretty active social life.

Got my results today.	Hi everyone! A little background: 26F, no medical issues that I know of. Used to workout, until quarantine happened. Work in veterinary medicine, we’re an essential business so we never really slowed down during lockdown. I’m constantly cleaning everything at home and generally very careful. On Friday 6/5 I had major body aches and fatigue. My temperature was a bit increased after work. 99.7, when my usual temperature never really rises above 99.2. I figured I had just worked a little bit too hard. 6/6 Saturday I woke up hot! I checked my temperature as soon as I got up and it was 98.9. My temperature then continued to increase throughout the day, I was lightheaded and the fatigue continued. I had a high of 99.4 without doing any activity. This isn’t normal for me so I knew something was up. I also had some eye pain? My eyes felt strained. Side note - my partner realized he lost his sense of smell &amp; taste this day. He gets morning allergies so we didn’t know if this was the cause. We scheduled covid-19 tests. 6/7 Sunday I woke up feeling fine except for a very mild headache. Very very very	Got my results today.

Steadily improving and feeling hopeful	Hey I just want to say im doing a lot better and finally my sleeping is starting to become normal again. I have a lot less pain and my heart rate is not as high as before for sure. Chest pain almost nonexistent. Yesterday, I managed to do a long walk and some exercise. No relapse today and feel the same as I did before. A few weeks ago I would have relapsed but I did not. I got an echo but the tech did not really notice anything during the procedure. Its possible I need something for the heart rate my doctor will confirm that to me but otherwise I seem ok. I have no decline in lung function and I am doing some autoimmune testing because they found something in my ANA but that could just because I have a family history of it. My other autoimmune panels did not show anything but there just doing more to double check. Anyway I am doing well overall and I hope you guys will too. At first, I was thinking I was going to die (especially in the first few weeks).

Antibody test negative?	Hey guys, if you checked my history, I’ve tested Covid on 3/25 and positive test came back 4/4. Been having fatigue, SOB, chest tightness/pain and aches for the entire time though it’s a lot better right now. I took an IGG anti-body test in CITYMD a few days ago and it came back negative though. Anyone else have the same thing? And if you guys don’t know, CITYMD and some other urgent care is providing walk in antibody test for everyone at this point of time. They take a vial of blood instead of the finger prick one, and results takes a few days.	Antibody test negative?

For those who’ve tested positive, what do you plan on doing?	I’ve gotten tested, but here in the United States, it takes a long time to get results because our system just isn’t very efficient. I’m not very hopeful because I can’t smell/taste anything right now and I hear that pretty much guarantees that you have it. So what now, then? Just stay hope and wait it out, hoping it’ll go away on it’s own? Is that really the only option we have? I won’t be able to work so I’m screwed.

Doctor suspected my dad [52 M] of having COVID for about 2 weeks; started to feel better, only to get diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia yesterday. I feel awful	My dad’s has all the trademark COVID symptoms over the past couple of weeks; an almost constant fever, lethargy, a loss of smell and taste, diarrhea, etc. The only thing he didn’t really have was a cough. He hasn’t ate properly in 2 weeks, and has often been sleeping for 20 hours at a time. The last couple of days he seemed to improve; he was up and about for once and not bed ridden, his fever had disappeared and his sense of taste and smell came back. Over the past couple of days though he started coughing more, and despite improving physically I’d say, he’s been getting increasingly anxious about it all. He felt a little short of breath and the cough got worse, his anxiety about it all got to the point he couldn’t sleep, so he went to the hospital. Once there the doctor diagnosed him with bacterial pneumonia, and thinks that he has had COVID, but that it’s passed now, but that it fucked up his immune system and allowed the bacterial pneumonia to creep in. I was shocked at this, I found it strange it wasn’t the viral pneumonia that COVID directly causes.

If you were asymptomatic but tested positive, are you the type of person who rarely gets sick in general?	I rarely ever get sick to the point that those in close contact with me may get extremely sick with a flu or cold, and I never seem to catch it (or at least I never show symptoms). To those who tested positive but were asymptomatic, do you also rarely become ill? Or are you more average in terms of how frequently and severely you get sick from regular run-of-the-mill illnesses (flu, cold, etc.)?

What happens after you start having symptoms and isolate?	I probably don’t have Covid but I sure am anxious. I’m more worried about being quarantined in my own home because what about all the things I touched? The bed I slept in and all. How are they handled?

Loss of smell and taste?!	Hi guys Wife and I have not been tested but for past week we have had the mild symptoms after being in contact with someone who went down pretty bad with covid. We had aches, fever and mild headache for 4 days. My left tonsil swelled massively too. That's just going down. Neither of us had a significant cough though, which made us questions if it was covid19. We thought it was just a cold, but now, despite feeling a lot better, both of us have completely lost our senses of smell and taste (been two days now). Did many other people have this with covid? We have been isolating for 9 days, but unsure about going out yet if we still have symptoms. Fever has gone though.	Loss of smell and taste?!

How did you guys get tested?	Hello, wondering if anyone has any answers for how to get tested. I have no health insurance, been experiencing a very mild sore throat and a stuffed nose. I searched for free testing areas near me and made an appointment for one, but the earliest I can get tested is in July 7th. I’m freaking out a little as I’ve seen that even mild symptoms can still be COVID positive and I have recently been in contact with family, I want to get tested as soon as possible. Thanks.

Can covid 19 cause dysphagia?	On telemed after my test I had a few momenst where breathing became labored and best I can describe was suddenly i couldnt swallow or reopen my throat. Is this a covid thing? My doc said she highly suspects I have it as she watched me. If it is, is this a reason covid would need a vent? I feel lucky to have gotten my throat back eventually. (I also have this happen sometimes from other illnesses while eating but I have a feeding tube (it's complex I'm pretty much an experiment..) I i had dry mouth and that was it as this all happened.

What's a good pulse oximeter that's not chinese garbage?	I feel like Amazon nowadays is flooded with non-sense chinese garbage as 99% of listings for most products. You have to actually search out good quality products on Amazon these days. What is a good pulse oximeter that is actually accurate and not some cheap chinese garbage? I don't care if it's on Amazon or not, although I'd prefer it. I don't even care if it's made in China as long as it's a reputable and functional one. The reason I am so specific is because I have a family member with a pulse ox that is very clearly not actually measuring their blood oxygen and is just spitting out random numbers because on multiple occasions now it's spit out 98% and then they take it off their finger, put it on and suddenly it's 92, then they do it again and it's 99... All from the same finger, literally seconds apart.	What's a good pulse oximeter that's not chinese garbage?

Day 40 Update	Update since it’s been a while and I think some might benefit from this. Done a few posts on covid and my thoughts, if you’d like to read my initial presentation it is in my history. 17, male. Today marks day 40 (I think?) symptoms are weird. Here goes: - Random pains: pretty much everywhere, just get random nagging pains especially in my chest and abdomen. -Joint pain: in its own category because it presents pretty consistently unlike the random pains, I have a feeling of inflammation and a “fullness” I guess along with pain in my knees and elbows, on and off. -Arrhythmia: Cardiac symptoms started recently. Heart palpitations more than normal as well as random bouts of tachycardia with exertion beyond what’s normal. -Nausea: hits me randomly when I’m lying down and persists for about an hour, like I’m going to pass out. -SOB: not as persistent but still occasional. -Insomnia: somewhat new but I seem to have heightened anxiety which may or may not have led to the insomnia or it may be a symptom of its own. Waking up multiple times throughout the night, not because of urination. Symptoms seem to appear and disappear, who knows	Day 40 Update Update since it’s been a while and I think some might benefit from this.

Is it possible I had it?	I’m a 17f and Idk if I had covid back in February. I was still in school during this time. Around Valentine’s Day I attended a concert and was in the pit surrounded by a ton of ppl. A few days later I was coughing a bit. Then, exactly 5 days later, I attended a basketball game, felt feverish, and went home with my friend. The next day I was in my school’s play. I felt feverish and claustrophobic and was coughing a bit. I was very distracted though because of the play and didn’t think much of it. My closest friend felt a little sick too after I got sick, but none of my other friends or even my parents got sick either:/ Also, before I attended the concert, in one of my classes this girl sat behind me with an awful cough and was always coughing on me. I never checked my temperature to see if I had a fever, but I definitely felt like I did for 2 days.

As I sit here on day 74....	My chest pain is nearly constant right now. Flares up at night and feels as though a child’s hand is squeezing onto it and won’t let go. The other night I almost went to the ER but fortunately, the pain subsided. Got an echocardiogram done today and oddly hoping they find something definitive, so that I can actually get it treated.

I'm posting this for any medical ppl reading these posts to give an idea of what longterm symptoms can look like. And to plead for more investigation to be put into long-haul sufferers. I'm not alone.

I can only guess that one of my kids brought it home from school and have just been asymptomatic...no one else in my house has been sick. My symptoms started last Thursday with body aches, fatigue, low grade fever, nasal congestion, sinus pressure and sinus headache. I then lost my taste and smell abruptly on Friday and got tested Saturday morning. The sinus symptoms have since improved and I am now continuing with body aches, fatigue, no taste or smell, and noticed yesterday tightness in my chest that has gotten a little worse today. I have a feeling of needing to clear my throat and upper lungs but no real cough. No fever since Monday. I am having a really hard time eating, I guess my appetite is down but its mostly because I cant taste anything.

I am having a really hard time eating, I guess my appetite is down but its mostly because I cant taste anything. I do have a history of	2
My dad is in ICU and is on oxygen support,is it common in covid..will he recover?	The doctor said there is nothing to worry about for now..but I am really worried. His saturation with the oxygen support is 100% but without the mask it drops to 88-92%. Any of you have any experience with this? How long did you take to recover?

My covid+ symptoms timeline	I am in the late 20s, F, healthy, no other existing medical conditions. On 7/8 (Wednesday), I was told I had been exposed the day prior (Tuesday) to someone that had just tested positive. I had been wearing a surgical mask, but the positive person at the time was not. On 7/9 (Thursday), I woke up with a dry cough and very mild sore throat. It felt like something was in my throat and really just felt like allergies. Then I had a mild/moderate headache in the evening. I took some ibuprofen and hoped I would feel better the next day. On 7/10 (Friday), I woke up with a headache and just felt off. Considering my recent exposure, I decided to get tested to be safe. I felt like crap throughout the day and continued to take ibuprofen to help with the headache. I was pretty warm and constantly sweating too. There were times when I felt short of breath, but nothing extreme. On 7/11 (Saturday), I woke up with another headache and felt fatigued. Took some ibuprofen in the morning and I felt better than the previous day overall. Found out I had tested positive for covid. On 7/12	My covid+ symptoms timeline I am in the late 20s, F, healthy, no other existing medical conditions.

Why am I still not getting better?	ASSUMING that I have covid, why am I still not getting better? For the past month my only symptoms have been phlegm in my throat and difficulty breathing when I bend forward or slouch or exert myself too much. I haven't tested for covid yet because my doctor just told me that my symptoms don't necessarily mean covid. HOWEVER, ASSUMING I actually have covid, why am I not getting better? I've been drinking n-acetylcystine to get rid of the phlegm to no avail. Throughout the whole month, my highest temperature was 37.4. I didn't have cough, sore throat, or other symptoms. Does covid not go away on its own?	Why am I still not getting better? ASSUMING that I have covid, why am I still not getting better?

Girlfriend and I both positive, should we quarantine together?	Just as the title says. Both my girlfriend and I tested positive for COVID-19, and she practically lives with me anyway. Is it okay/safe for her to stay with me at my house in my room and quarantine together, or should she go home and quarantine on her own? We're doing the usual stuff, disinfecting, staying away from family, etc etc. Should we also wear masks around each other, despite us both having it?

Survivor aftermath	Anybody else that’s in recovery have a very hard time with physical activity? I had moderate symptoms for about two weeks. Started as a cold then progressed to chest pain and shortness of breath scary enough for a quick ER trip. Thankfully it never got into my lungs and the shortness of breath only hung on for a few days. I had probably 3 or 4 waves of symptoms in total. Today is Day 21 for me and I’ve finally felt back to normal for about a week now. I just went on a 10 minute walk and felt like I walked across the entire city. Before getting sick, I probably walked over two miles a day between walking around my city and working on my feet all day. I’m just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. It’s really frustrating.	Survivor aftermath Anybody else that’s in recovery have a very hard time with physical activity? I had moderate symptoms for about two weeks.

Update	Hey guys. I test positive in July and in early August finally tested negative. I didn’t get my taste back until about the 10th of August. It’s 9/18 and I’m still struggling w tasting and smelling. I smell something nasty all the time no matter what it is now. Something burnt and strong and my food taste really gross. Whether I make it or I eat out. I know this is not in my head because it’s actually bothering me and it makes me not want to eat. Is anyone experiencing this?	Update Hey guys.

I have this friend and we haven’t talked in two weeks so I pulled up to his house to say hi. He gets in my car and hugs me. an hour after I hang out wit him I get a call that he is positive and that he went to get a test yesterday. IM SORRY WHAT. turns out the kid knew that he was exposed for the past week. when i got that call today my anxiety went through the roof. he never told me that he had been exposed or tested and hopped in my car. i know i wasn’t rlly social distancing but i wouldn’t have come to his house if he told me that he was exposed and got tested. I’m getting tested tmo morning. currently quarantining myself.	i’m pissed so i haven’t been social distancing but out of all the ways I got exposed I got exposed in such an awful way.

An Asymptomatic Positive	Still coming to terms with my positive result. It came in Thursday, May 14th, about a week after I was tested. No symptoms, no known exposure. I tested because my work asked those of us who had been out and about helping other departments to do so before we reopened to the public in any capacity (I work for one of the library systems). Now, I'm in quarantine with the other 3 members of my household under quarantine within the rest of the house. Our veterinarian is well aware of our situation and advised us shortly after the positive came through. My work is, thankfully, understanding. I know there are others not as fortunate with their situations and I truly hope the virus passes through as quickly as possible with as little impact as possible. It's Day 4 and I'm still coming to terms with our situation. Any advice?	An Asymptomatic Positive Still coming to terms with my positive result.

Lump feeling on back right side of my tongue?	I wake up with sore throats most mornings because I live in Colorado and the air is super dry here, and they usually go away after I drink some water. However I woke up this morning with this weird... lump feeling on the back of my tongue, just on the right side, that I can feel when I swallow. I work in a hospital and just moved so I was around people a lot, and I’m just wondering if anyone felt this particular symptom.	Lump feeling on back right side of my tongue?

Any scientific explanation about the relapses?	My 2 cents is that the body can't fight all the virus at once because it doesn't have enough resources, but it can fight it off stage by stage. Meaning you feel better, then the virus multiplies again, but probably not as much as in the beginning and so the immune system deploys white blood cells again and this keeps happening until you finally get rid of it. It's incremental and it takes a lot of time, but the body is fighting it. I think the scariest thing patients go through is the relapses and we should by now have an official medical explanation. Let me know your thought on this.	Any scientific explanation about the relapses?

BHT supplement for COVID-19	Out of curiosity, has anyone here been taking BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene) supplements to prevent COVID-19 but still got the virus? My mom is a healthcare worker and we have been taking BHT regularly in hopes that its ability to damage the protective outer layer of virus cells could help protect us against the virus. There have been studies showing that the use of BHT has been useful against viruses like HIV, SARS, and other lipid encapsulated viruses. If you have been taking BHT but still got COVID, I’m curious if your symptoms were mild or not.

Symptoms Questions	I’m 27, no health conditions, non smoker, and at a healthy weight Yesterday I woke up with a headache. Thought it could have been from dehydration so I drank a bunch of water and that didn’t seem to help. Took some Tylenol and that did the trick. Last night before bed I noticed my nose was burning every time I took a breath in. Went to bed and slept well. Today the headache is gone but I still get moments of nose burning. I can still smell and taste and have no fever. I’m also getting chills every now and then. Not sure if it’s the anxiety kicking in or what. Just looking for some input...

Parents both hospitalized	My mom tested positive on Sept 2. It didn't seem that bad at first. Her main symptom was nausea. After worry, my reaction was anger. My parents are in a state that hasn't taken this seriously, so they didn't take it seriously. They wore masks, but kept going to church, out to eat, on vacation, shopping, etc. She thought my husband and I were being too cautious because we still haven't eaten in a restaurant. We only got out to pick up food and get groceries /necessities. Even after her positive result she was still planning on going on a trip she planned for their 38th anniversary, because the trip was more than 2 weeks after she was tested. On Sept 6, she agreed to go to the ER. Her condition was so bad they admitted her immediately. On Sept 7 they put her on a ventilator. On Sept 8, the doctor warned us they may have to put her on an ECMO, as a last resort. They decided to try putting her on her stomach first. It worked. Her oxygen levels improved. They've been placing her on her stomach for 16 hours and her back for 8 hours all	Parents both hospitalized My mom tested positive on Sept 2. It didn't seem that bad at first.

3 months of illness	So far, anyway. I became symptomatic on March 4th. Every day since then I’ve had a fever of 100+. Almost every day I wake up with a weird “toxic” feeling throughout my body, like the feeling of cold sweats without the sweating part. Tachycardia is at a minimum now, but I attribute that to increased fluid intake. Still have fatigue and general weakness. Sometimes my balance is a bit off. Sometimes I get dizzy for no reason. I also dream literally every single time I sleep, as in remember the dreams after waking, and that is the strangest thing. 3 months of nightly memorable dreams. Nothing seems to improve the fever at all besides Tylenol for a couple hours. Lots of moving around or anything that could resemble exercise if you squinted a little seems to bring on a fever or exacerbate a present one. Tbh just existing brings on a fever or exacerbates one, so I guess it doesn’t even really matter if I do anything or not because I’ll be sick either way. The waves of body aches with the fever fkn sucks, though, because it’s pretty painful. The nausea is ridiculous most days. Apparently my taste has	3 months of illness So far, anyway.

Nausea and Vomitting, Anyone Else?	Sorry this is a bit longer than anticipated. Last section has most of the important details if you want to skip ahead. Husband and I both tested positive on June 5th. We got lucky and have had mostly mild symptoms. He's not experienced any GI issues, but I've been experiencing them off and on since test day. Now here's the fun part, I'm 19 weeks pregnant, my entire first trimester I was pretty sick, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, etc. After about 12/13 weeks it eased up dramatically to the point where I had been enjoying normal foods again etc. Fast forward to June 5th, husband has felt weird for a couple days and I'm just blaming allergies, but he woke up that morning with no taste and smell. I woke up June 5th and had some allergy symptoms but didn't think anything of it (before I knew he lost taste and smell, cuz I was supposed to work early that day and he didn't work until later so slept in), I ended up getting sick at work and threw up for the first time in a few weeks.

Our Covid Story (Very Long)	We are trying to get this out to show people how devastating this can be. If you'd like to share, please do. We have people sharing it all over Facebook. A news crew is coming to interview me tomorrow. My husband, Mike, transported construction crews and took people on their vacations. The week of August 10, 2020, he took a family on vacation from Southern Iowa to North Dakota and Minnesota. On August 14, one of his passengers became ill with respiratory symptoms. Mike arrived back home on August 15. On the 16th, some of our children and grandchildren were here for a visit. On August 17, Mike and I took a girl to Minnesota and picked up her parents, who had been on the trip to North Dakota. On our way back home, he started feeling sick. He got progressively worse through the day and as we got home that evening, he had trouble just walking to the house. He was very weak and started having a deep cough and a fever. On the 18th, we drove to a clinic with a 15 minute test. He tested positive with Covid-19 and was told to go straight home and isolate.

I've had a sore throat since yesterday...	We went out last sunday because I had to visit a service center for my phone. While I was there waiting in line, the person behind me was coughing and sneezing quite a lot. While initially I wasn't too afraid, because in my country no one can enter a mall or shop without wearing a face mask and face shield, however since yesterday I've been feeling an itch in my throat and there was a moment that my body felt really hot. I didn't have a fever, and I felt better once I got some sleep. Today though, my sore throat seemed to have gotten worse? It's not to bad to the point that I can't swallow, but it definitely feels sore. I'm wearing a face mask around the house to lessen the chances of my family getting whatever I have, but they don't seem to take me seriously when I say I want to isolate or to get a swab test. They believe since I don't have a fever or still have my smell and taste, I most likely don't have covid. Should I still insist on getting tested?	I've had a sore throat since yesterday...

I went to camp	I went to camp and it was great! The only thing you had to do before going to this camp, was to give the teachers a document, that says you aren't sick. We all did apart from one guy. On the first day he had fever but still wanted to take part in everything. The teachers didn't want to send him back, bc they needed him (since we were doing a musical and he was one of the main characters). This guy was the reason the whole musical is now sick and at home The day of the concert as I was singing in the choir I felt light headed and couldn't breathe.

We all did apart from one guy. On the first day he had fever but still wanted to take part in everything. The teachers didn't want to send him back, bc they needed him (since we were doing a musical and he was one of the main characters). This guy was the reason the whole musical is now sick and at home The day of the concert as I was singing in the choir I felt light headed and couldn't breathe.

Has anyone who has tested positive experienced multiple day diarrhea?	Seems better today but about 3 times a day for the last week I’ve experienced diarrhea. Very unusual for me, can’t say I’ve ever had that happen before. No other symptoms other than a very mild fever one night that was about 1.5 degrees higher than normal. I’ve experienced sore throat and headache a few times, likely allergies so that doesn’t concern me. I’ve read multiple articles stating that many of the worst cases have started with GI issues, some comments I’ve read have suggested they are getting it at the end of their illness. Asked my Dr. and she of course told me it’s not one of the symptoms and there’s no treatment so just stay home either way. Also am asthmatic so I’m very concerned it will hit my lungs next but would love to hear from any confirmed cases who’ve experienced GI issues, specifically diarrhea and when in their illness it occurred.

Waiting for results... but this cannot be anything else.	Hi everyone. I am a 24 year old female with asthma. On Thursday, I fell ill with a 100.5 fever. Since then it fluctuates from 100-101.9. Has not yet gotten to 102. I have had terrible stomach cramps &amp; diarrhea since Friday morning (4 am). So... it’s been 5 days of fever and 4 days of.... gastro issues. I have had a sore throat on a off. &amp; to be honest- sometimes I can’t tell if my shortness of break is a result of my asthma/allergies or potential covid. I have been taking my steroid inhaler and regular inhaler when it has gotten bad. But I will usually get anxious, cry, and then I can breathe “easier”. Had chills badly first couple of days- now just the fever. I got tested Saturday morning and am anxiously waiting for my results. I know I should call my Dr. tomorrow... but I don’t know when the symptoms get “severe enough” to seek medical care/ go to the ER ?

21-year-old with Asthmatic history	June 30th started with bad diarrhea. Then it progressed to a fever. Chills. Night sweats. it's currently July 3rd and I feel good in the day but seem to get bad at night. I've exposed my twin brother (21), mom (50), dad (51), and possibly sister (16). I'm really worried about them. I won't be able to live with myself if I lose one of them due to my carelessness.	21-year-old with Asthmatic history June 30th started with bad diarrhea.

Looking for advice for my COVID+ parents	"My mom (older gen x) just called me to let me know that she and my stepdad (boomer) tested positive. I'm definitely struggling with all of the emotions.

It’s no joke	Hey guys - I know it’s frustrating &amp; you can’t trust those asshats in our government but seriously - Covid is a killer. I watched my Hubz choking on the floor, unable to get enough breath to talk to me. I thought he was going to die in front of us. It took him 12 weeks to breathe properly again. There are no words to describe that - but that’s Covid. Please wear your mask. Please don’t mix households. Please follow the rules, however contradictory they seem. I wouldn’t wish what my bestie went through on anyone. Our kids still struggle with him going away after they saw him carried off in an ambulance. It’s not a hoax. We know the government are waiting to see who will die &amp; it will somehow be their fault. But you can help. Please wear the mask.

Worrisome symptoms	About 3 hours ago I started getting really weird heart palpitations and heart flutters that made me feel winded without even doing anything. They’re still there. As soon as that happened, I’ve been having a throbbing feeling in my left thumb and hand, throbbing/numbness/ weakness in my left leg, throbbing in my left foot, occasional numbness on the left side of my head and a pretty bad headache. I’ve had the headache for about 2 straight days now. My pulse ox dipped down to 93 for a few minutes but went back up, I’m not sure if it was a malfunction or not. Has anyone else experienced this? I’m also super dizzy as well. Not sure if I should go to the ER :/	Worrisome symptoms About 3 hours ago I started getting really weird heart palpitations and heart flutters that made me feel winded without even doing anything.

Relative Tested positive	One of my close relatives was tested positive yesterday. However3 days ago he was at our place for the whole day and reported fever and cough. Despite being tested positive he says that he is fine and has isolated himself in a room at his house. However, now I'm worried about my family. Since today morning I've been feeling tired but not sure is it because I'm positive too or because I didn't eat properly yesterday. Also, my body feels a bit warm and the water felt colder while I bath. Not sure if it is because of weakness. Please post relevant advice and links in the comment section.

When to get tested?	(sorry, english isn't my first language) I work at a long term care facility. We are tested every 2 weeks (more or less). Last test was Wednesday, I received my result today and it was negative. I've spoked with a nurse at work yesterday (Thursday) for 5 minutes. We both had our masks on (surgical). We didn't speak to each others any other time this week because he mostly have night shifts and I mostly have day shifts. But we have lot of patients in common that we both interacted with and we touched the same files too. I've learned today (Friday) that he is Covid positive (he also got tested Wednesday). Because of it, my work place ask me to be tested again this afternoon which I did. Is the result gonna be reliable though, since I've been in contact with him yesterday? When should I be tested again to make sure it isn't a false negative? There's gonna be another screening at work in 2 weeks but I'm so stressed and I would love to make sure I'm negative before that.

(20F) Weird symptoms for over a month now. Reinfection or long hauling?	I don’t have any pre existing health conditions other than asthma. A little over a month ago I thought that I had covid because I stupidly went on a vacation to a covid hotspot. I had a sore throat and a low grade fever for a few days and EXTREME leg pain.

Now I’m getting some symptoms back, a possible reinfection?? Long hauling?? I have no clue. After hanging out with a friend that doesn’t give a shit about covid is when I started having some symptoms. I was so tired for a few days, sleeping 10-12 hours a day AND taking a nap.

Scared I fucked up. Any ways to boost my immune system?	Here is a timeline: - Tested negative three weeks ago after two weeks of coughing and shortness of breath. - Felt better for a few days, than developed red petechiae in my throat and a sore throat. It was better after a few days. - I don't drink often, but I had a few beers three days ago and I woke up feeling TERRIBLE. I went to the grocery store yesterday, but I was wearing a N95 mask, gloves and took my shower right after. Now am I more at risk of getting it because I was still slightly feeling under the weather? I feel fine except for clearing my throat a little.	Scared I fucked up. Any ways to boost my immune system?

How can I best help Mom?	My mom received her positive on 8/14. She was tested a couple days earlier alongside her husband who had symptoms. A bit of background: My mom had no symptoms at time of testing but felt crappy by the time she received her positive. My grandma who lives with my mom was also sick and presumed positive. Grandma ended up in the hospital after a fall that we think was brought on by weakness and spent about 5 days there after they found pneumonia. She is home now and still recovering but doing better. My mom’s husband ended up in the hospital 3 days ago and is in the ICU with oxygen and sugar issues. I live about 25 minutes away, married and have a 2 year old - so I’m limited on how I can help. Back to mom, it’s hit her like a ton of bricks. Bad headaches, extreme body aches, fever, lack of smell/taste, nausea, and cough. Full on symptoms at full force for over a week now and I just don’t hear it in her voice that she’s improving.

Exercise post COVID	Howdy all! Today is day 16 after testing positive, and I am feeling fully back to normal, knock on wood. My fatigue seems to have mostly resolved, my resting heart rate is back to its normal range, and all other symptoms have cleared up (except my taste smell, which I’d say are 80% back to normal). I’m going a bit stir crazy and feeling very lazy from not being active, so seeking advice from anyone who has successfully gotten back to working out post COVID. I’m concerned about potentially relapsing or exacerbating any invisible heart issues. Does anyone have tips on what worked, or any articles/research on ways to safely resume exercise?

23 weeks later. Finally off the blood thinners. Clot is gone. Pericardial effusion is gone. Guts back to normal. Ear pain gone. Random low level fevers gone. Sun sensitivity gone. Rashes gone. Energy levels way up.	It's been a hell of a 6 months, but I think I'm finally over this. Just came back from a 12 day camping trip. First time out since early march. Decided to go after I stopped the thinners because I needed to escape these 4 walls. Had a blast. Was just what I needed. I'm finally back. I'm still a bit sensitive to certain foods, and I'm apparently a migraine sufferer now, but I'm green on nearly every level. For months I thought this was for life. I can't express how happy I am that it appears otherwise. Hold Fast, friends. This shit does end.	23 weeks later. Finally off the blood thinners. Clot is gone. Pericardial effusion is gone.

Just came back from a 12 day camping trip. First time out since early march. Decided to go after I stopped the thinners because I needed to escape these 4 walls. Had a blast. Was just what I needed. I'm finally back. I'm still a bit sensitive to certain foods, and I'm apparently a migraine sufferer now, but I'm green on nearly every level. For months I thought this was for life. I can't express how happy I am that it appears otherwise. Hold Fast, friends. This shit does end.	2
Has anybody here with persistent symptoms tried steroids?	Hello, I'm 33 and I've been sick for 2 months exactly. I noticed some improvement in some areas (sore throat is gone, pain in the lungs is not as sharp, I feel less tired) but some symptoms are still there. My heart beat has been very fast for the last 2-3 days so much so that it's hard to sleep. &amp;#x200B; I noticed some people on this board and elsewhere have tried oral steroids and said this has worked wonders. I was wondering if someone could give us a little feedback. &amp;#x200B; Cheers !	Has anybody here with persistent symptoms tried steroids? Hello, I'm 33 and I've been sick for 2 months exactly.

How did you clean your home post Covid	I’ll be at day 9 tomorrow and I’ve been disinfecting each night the rooms I’m in. I never had a fever so my doctor said I shouldn’t be contagious a week after showing symptoms so I wanted to start washing and cleaning . I still plan on quarantining the full 14 days . I’ve been mostly in my bedroom and am planning on washing everything including my pillows and disinfecting all surfaces. I also was thinking about deep disinfecting everything once I’m better and moving out of my room for a while and set up camp in the living room and leave my door closed for a few days. after you recovered did you clean and stay in your room? My roommate moved out temporarily while I recover and I just want to make sure everything is clean and sanitized before she comes back next week. Any help with cleaning or your experience cleaning your home post Covid would be great .

Gaslighting myself?	29F here, no previous health conditions, generally fit. I had fever of 37.6-37.9 for 2 days at the end of March, then sometimes slightly high temperature (~37.2). The symptoms I’ve had but they are gone now: - some productive coughing - diarrhoea + super gassy + lots of burping - feeling like there’s a lump in my throat - upper back/neck pain (Very bad!) - Intense muscle/joint pains - fatigue - fits of “feeling weird” (dizzy and all over off) followed by intense shaking - palpitations - chest pressure and some chest pains (needles-like) - awful cold sores (first time in many years) - feeling heat in my face - pain in lymph nodes (on my neck) - some weird pain in my veins on both wrists - Slightly scratchy throat - Unusual thirst The symptoms I still have: - shortness of breath: it comes and goes in waves. At some point it was present for days, then for several hours, now it’s mostly gone. It’s not like I’m gasping for air, it just feels like every breath I take doesn’t give as much oxygen as it normally would. - post-nasal drip - GI issues - unusually gassy + a	Gaslighting myself? 29F here, no previous health conditions, generally fit.

Can i have coffee with CoronaVirus?	Just asking as im not sure what makes it worse and what makes it better from a drug standpoint. I know ibuprofen and dxm make it worse and possibly dph as its a immune suppressant I believe but not sure about coffee. Also is dph a immune suppressant because i know its used for allergies so probably suppresses the immune system if im gonna think about it logically. 15/16 days into coronavirus and i feel like im starting to recover abit but not sure because i keep on having bad and good days , as i feel like im slowly recovering i dont wanna jeopardise it by taking coffee or something which would make it worse	Can i have coffee with CoronaVirus?

Test inconclusive	Has anyone had a test that could not produce results? I did the drive through testing with CVS. They called today asking me to retest because there wasn't enough information. I inserted the swab until it hurt my eyes, could that really not be deep enough?	Test inconclusive Has anyone had a test that could not produce results? I did the drive through testing with CVS.

How did you receive your results and how long did it take?	Hello, I posted in 'I think I have it' but so many people posted there that my question got lost. I will start by going over my symptoms and potential exposure and how I eventually received testing. I live in Oklahoma in the second worst affected county and work in the WORST affected county. Again, not a lot of people due to lack of testing but the ERs are already running out medical supplies here. I believe it is already widespread and community transmission has been confirmed. So I am not at liberty to say my exactly where I work, however, I work at a place where the employees are supposed to clean most things except the bathroom and the floor and we have hundreds of people who travel all over the states and abroad every day. Obviously, our office doesn't ever clean for anything unless absolutely necessary. I got sick about a week after a bunch of people came back to work on my team. Half my team is now out sick as well as my boyfriend who developed the same symptoms but I am by far the one in the worst condition as far as I am aware.

29F and 28M	I got covid19 and so did my husband. he has asthma &amp; I have type one diabetes. here's a thread of it so far....starting Friday. We're not sure where we got it but we assume from varsity sports practice or the required professional development our school had. (practice was held after the pd). day one, we felt fine. we went to school to do last minute touches on his classroom before the weekend hit. that night at exactly 7:30pm, my husband suddenly became extremely warm and developed a fever of 100.8. he felt terrible, I felt fine. I was convinced it was his allergies. day two, we woke up and he still had fever 101 to 100.4. we snagged an appt. for 11:30a. I planned to get tested to. I had no symptoms. At 12pm we got tested. His fever was gone, my had started. I was surprised to when the nurse said I was 100.8. we went home, then he got v tired. he slept for several hours in his makeshift isolation room. it was as if he couldn't keep his eyes open. I was achy but not tired. I had watering eyes and killer sinus allergies all day.	29F and 28M I got covid19 and so did my husband. he has asthma &amp; I have type one diabetes. here's a thread of it so far....starting Friday.

What should I do? Help!	So I started having itchy pain behind my throat on Sunday night. I had 5 days posting in gynaecology ward with 5 other colleagues. I have asked them everyday if they had had any symptoms but all of them haven't had any. My main symptom is sore throat/throat pain, mild dry cough, runny nose(almost recovered), and fatigue. No fever and it's been 6 days. I went to a physician today who diagnosed me with urti and prescribed me with antibiotics and antihistaminics. He looked into my throat and said I didn't have to worry. Should I go for a covid test? I havent gotten one as none of my colleagues, whom I was sharing duties day and night with have shown any kind of symptoms and I haven't had the slightest of fever or headache or loss of taste/smell. Am I just stressing myself out now? 😁	What should I do? Help! So I started having itchy pain behind my throat on Sunday night. I had 5 days posting in gynaecology ward with 5 other colleagues.

Upper Back Pain?	I am waiting for my results from my test. However I am curious as to if anyone else is experiencing upper back aches/pain? I had just assumed it was sore muscles from coughing or the gardening I have been doing. However now that I have read that our lungs are inset near our backs and not our front, I am thinking now that I have been having lung discomfort for awhile. I don't know what day I am on if I even have it, if I go with the first day I think I had symptoms its day 17, if its the other date its around day 9. Either way, this is some scary stuff and although ALL of my stats say I am fine, I can't help but worry, especially when the doctor felt it was needed to test me.	Upper Back Pain?

My mom and dad just came out positive.	My dad was having issues with breathing, my mom and I were having what we though was a cold last week. This Monday their results came and they were both positive. Because I don't have any symptoms now I can't do a PCR test with no medical order, so I just got a blood test and came negative. However I feel I got it. Anyway they live together with my older brother. My dad is 70 and my mom 66, my brother 40. I live next building. I just got a oxigen concentrator for my dad (o2 lvls are 87-83). My mom does still have to care for my dad cause he's weak. Do you have any advice on how to handle?

Can coughing help the breathing?	Friday May 22 I started to get a fever and I started getting breathing problems Sunday 24, I’ve had a low grade fever on and off but yesterday Sunday 30 I started coughing flem and I was shivering at night. I thought it was just panic attacks which I’ve had occasionally but it’s Been a week of this :( I’m trying to avoid the hospital badly, terrified of them but I’ve got backyard trees for oxygen therapy. But I’m now wondering if this trouble breathing is because of flem. Are we supposed to cough and let out the mucus to help us breath better? My fever hasn’t gotten too bad but anyone know how much longer? Does it usually better here on out now that there’s phlegm or is it another few weeks? :(	Can coughing help the breathing?

No fever more than 100, no sore throat. But headache	So it is been 4 days now. I have a body ache. Mostly legs. Felt little bit tired. Checked my fever and it was 99F. It has been swinging between 97-99.8/100 for last 4 days. I am taking Tylenol. I do not have any other symptoms than some headache last week. Should I get tested? Also I have a small baby.

My experience- presumed positive because of no taste/smell, wife tested negative but I think it’s false negative	So here’s the thing, my wife was tested and after 4 days results came back as negative, but she has all classic symptoms: dry cough, loss of taste/smell, breathing issues, fever. I had mild symptoms of low grade fever and mild body aches. That started to go away and then about 5 days ago I lost all my smell and taste. It’s so frustrating to not be able to smell or taste anything. But also it’s weird because I never got tested (I don’t see a need now since I’m sure I have it and it’s been 10 days since symptoms started) but on top of that my wife got a negative test. It’s a strange place to be in. And also I’m freaking out a little with wondering when taste and smell will come back.

Roommate tested positive last week	I have an interesting situation to say the least. My roommate tested positive last week and thankfully I'm in the UK at the moment as my father was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer and went over to visit before his surgery. I am coming back to the US tomorrow and I plan to stay at a friend's place until my roommate tests negative and then we will have the apartment professionally cleaned/sanitized shortly before I return. How long should I wait to go back to the apartment after he tests negative and have the apartment cleaned? We unfortunately share a bathroom which is where the greatest danger would be I think. Any advice is appreciated.	Roommate tested positive last week I have an interesting situation to say the least.

Xrays are clear, but lungs still affected	I’ve posted here before, but to recap, I had symptoms is early August, doctor diagnosed, and symptoms haven’t gone away. I just want some relief at this point. My lungs have been feeling worse and worse. My doctor seems to have no clue what to do and just keeps throwing inhalers and steroids at me. I’ve been on two rounds of antibiotics and five rounds of prednisone to no avail. Albuterol barely helps, prednisone only works a bit while I’m on it, allergy meds like loratadine help a bit temporarily. I wake up in the middle of the night with shortness of breath (can’t breathe in all the way, tightness, back pain), chest pain and a semi-wet cough still (feels like lodged mucus that my lung is too weak to move). I just want this to end. I’m so frustrated.

Sister tested positive and won’t self-quarantine	Really annoyed as you can guess. Her boyfriends roommate tested positive, something she found out after spending the weekend with her boyfriend. As I’m typing I’m waiting to get tested at CVS. She got her test after finding out about her boyfriends roommate. After I got home from work yesterday is when she told me she was positive. I asked when she found out and she told me that morning. So I spent that whole day at work potentially contagious, and she didn’t think it was important to tell me. I work with food as well so I feel particularly angry and guilty. We live together with our family since we are both still pretty young. She doesn’t stay in her room, she uses every bathroom instead of limiting herself to the one directly next to her room, she has no problem brushing right past me on the stairs and spitting at me when I tell her to get away. So I’m sure I’m positive.

How long after recovery have you tested positive	I’m presumed positive from my doctor and waiting to be tested on Monday. My doctor was suppose to schedule me or a test this past Friday but I guess they had no appointments until Monday. My symptoms started on April 22 with a slight cough, aches, chills, night sweats, extreme fatigue and slightly short of breath. On the 24th I started having eye pain when looking around and on the 26th I lost my smell and started becoming congested. Congestion got bad until April 30th, when it started getting a little better. Not sure if i had a temperature or not at the beginning since the thermometer I owned was broken. I did get one by the 26th and haven’t had a fever since then. At this point I feel almost back to 100%. I have some slight pain when taking a deep breath and my nose is still slightly congested at some points through out the day but everything else has disappeared. I have been getting some weird pains in my stomach after I eat, not really sure what that’s been about.

I'm in my room and my non asthmatic twin brother also has it but he seems to be doing fine. my back hurts like hell and it feels like every joint I have is on fire. I'm cold all the time and I found a rash on my thigh today. I told some of my friends and they're supportive and want to help but the only thing I can do is wait and I'm so scared. my asthma is getting really bad and it hurts to breathe and I'm scared something will happen to me. does anybody have any advice on what to do while I'm stuck in my room or the hospital for the next 2 weeks or so? is there any advice on how to make this easier or do I just grit my teeth and get through it? I know this is nonsensical but it all happened so fast and it felt like 2 days ago I was doing just fine and now I cant even get out of bed without crying from pain. any advice would be so appreciated.

Day 102 + 103: came back from the ER last night and a slight tinge of hope	i wrote here about day 101 and my chat with my doctor. i also mentioned having troubles sleeping because of an apnea like issue that ive never dealt with before. &amp;#x200B; quick recap of day 102: absolute misery. i was running on 3 hours of sleep ( and 5 hours of sleep the day before that ) and for the life of me could not handle being awake. i felt sick, angry, nauseous, hungry, short of breath, and exhausted. i was extremely fatigued and just couldnt handle it anymore, and went to the ER. Keep in mind, in march when i was initially sick and tried getting tested for covid, they said i was having anxiety and to take xanax once - 3 times a day before bed. then i got a pcp who told me not to take xanax ( but gave me more??? ) and backpeddled and said take 1-2 a day. ive only ever taken 1 a day because i was afraid of growing addicted, but after 3 months of using it i definitely did get an addiction and have been trouble with withdrawls. i have 3 halves of xanax left that my body find more than	Day 102 + 103: came back from the ER last night and a slight tinge of hope i wrote here about day 101 and my chat with my doctor. i also mentioned having troubles sleeping because of an apnea like issue that ive never dealt with before. &amp;#x200B; quick recap of day 102: absolute misery. i was running on 3 hours of sleep ( and 5 hours of sleep the day before that ) and for the life of me could not handle being awake. i felt sick, angry, nauseous, hungry, short of breath, and exhausted. i was extremely fatigued and just couldnt handle it anymore, and went to the ER.

Bad taste in my mouth	Hey I tested positive for COVID on 8/20. I had every symptom. I am almost fully recovered but I have this awful taste in my mouth when I eat anything.

Has anyone had shortness of breath on only one occasion or symptoms only for 24 hours?	My husband and I started getting symptoms yesterday which included fatigue, body aching, malaise, no appetite, and a slight cough. last night, we both slept terribly and had shortness of breath and weren’t able to take deep breaths at all. he developed a fever of about 100.3 and mine got to 99.4 or so but our temps are both back to normal now. i’ve had a weird out of it feeling since last night which i can only describe as being high or like waking up in the middle of the night after taking cough medicine.

Nurse who tried her best to stay healthy.	Healthy female 25yr Wisconsin. Not quite sure what to call day 1. Started August off with a mild cough, not unusual as I have asthma. Felt great the beginning of the month other than that. 8/11/2020- Terrible migraine along with aura, vertigo and general fatigue (normal - get these about 4x a year) which lasted until 8/13. Cough progressively worsened, body wide muscle aches along with complete lack of appetite. Also began taking 4+ hour long afternoon naps... the kind that you have no choice over. At this point I was still in denial thinking I had overworked myself. Luckily, I had been staying at home this whole time, other than a trip to my workplace to get a migraine IV where all PPE was worn. Evening of 8/14 felt a lot worse. Couldn’t move, talk, or take a deep breath without having a coughing fit. Along with a band like pressure around my chest. Decided to take my temp. Which ended up ranging from 101 - 102.3. Took some Advil and went to bed hoping that I would wake up feeling better. 8/15 - Woke up feeling not great. Temp Stanley in the 101s.

No fever no coughing but since the start my ears have been super blocked and I feel like my nose is really stuffed to the point where I can feel the ""top half of my face?"" I keep overthinking and thinking I have nerve damage because of this. I also have a weird feeling in my teeth at the ends it feels like my whole mouth is shrinking and have random pains in my neck too. Feels like my whole face is being sucked in. Is anybody else experiencing this and help me with my anxiety??"	"I have really weird symptoms Hey everyone, I was confirmed positive a little over 2 weeks ago and ive had the weirdest symptoms.

Sob only symptom, coincidence from medication?	Like title said all I have is shortness of breath, though I've never had it before so I'm not sure if that's even the right name. Just feel like I have really bad air hunger, but not like super quick breathing or anything just as if I have my breath held and that weird acidy blood feeling from Co2. The problem is that I recently went on medication that causes lactic acidosis, which also causes breathing problems. I talked to pharmacist and he took me off the medication from time being as he assumes it's that. It's my second day off medication and symptoms are improving so I really can't tell if this is just a bad coincidence or could be worse. I haven't been in contact with anyone known to have virus although I did have to go around a city, but all inclosed spaces and shops mask is required and so is hand sanitation and most people follow social distancing rules. This was 3 days ago and symptoms started less than 24 hours after city, which according to what the internet says the average is 2-10 days.

Just got tested and they didn’t ask to me to verify my name	Hello, my dad and I just got tested for covid (we both live in the same house) and the nurses who did our swab didn’t ask us to verify our names, just our addresses. I don’t know why I didn’t ask them to verify our names because I just thought that if we live in the same household, then if my dad tested positive, I will also test positive. I’m thinking about it and what if only one of us is positive, how do we know who tested positive if they confirm our names? Also the nasal swab didn’t hurt. They only did one nostril. It just felt uncomfortable, tickled and made me sneeze. Anyone else had this experience as well? I heard that it was supposed to make you tear up and make your nostril burn.

COVID-induced arrhythmia	"Would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience...stay strong out there! I never tested positive for the virus nor antibodies, but I traveled to Spain in late January and one week later had some difficulty breathing and some mild nausea for a couple of days. The breathing sensation was unlike anything I had felt before, and not even that bad...it basically just felt like my body was not breathing involuntarily -- instead I had to think about every breath. This went away after less than a week and I went about my way with no issues. Of course no one was talking about COVID in Europe at the time.

Mild symptoms for two months. Doctor suspects Covid-19.	I started getting bronchial chest pains a few days after attending a big event in London in early March. The very first thing I noticed was that my tinnitus got much worse and I lost most of the hearing in one ear. I had a dry cough I could easily suppress but no fever. I had pains around my kidneys and shoulders. I was very dehydrated, drinking 2-3 times the amount of water I normally would. Appetite was mildly suppressed and I had some chills with only one incidence of awakening drenched in sweat. I was very tired for about a week, with occasional headaches. But the bronchial chest pain didn't subside easily. It went away for a couple of days and then came back for another week but without the various other symptoms. This cycle lasted two months before I finally called the doctor for advice. My kids (14, 12) had headaches and mild fevers for 24 hours and nothing more. She said it sounds like it could have been Covid-19 but an antibody test will be required to confirm it. I'm fit and healthy, male late 40s. Has anyone else had anything similar that was confirmed as Covid-19?	Mild symptoms for two months. Doctor suspects Covid-19.

This cycle lasted two months before I finally called the doctor for advice. My kids (14, 12) had headaches and mild fevers for 24 hours and nothing more. She said it sounds like it could have been Covid-19 but an antibody test will be required to confirm it. I'm fit and healthy, male late 40s. Has anyone else	1
Got tested today at my nearest COVID-19 center	All my symptoms started on Saturday Day 1: I thought that my allergies were acting up because I started with a post nasal drip. Day 2: still had the post nasal drip but I started to develop a cough with phlegm. Day 3: minimal cough with phlegm but I started to feel tired like my eyes were burning. (I associated this with drinking the night before) Day 4: started getting chills, checked my temperate and it was running at 101.2. The chills come and ago about every 30 seconds. Still have a lot of phlegm. Went to my nearest COVID-19 testing site and got tested. Now I’m just waiting to hear if I’m negative or not. My question is, most people complain about a dry cough, do you all believe this could be associated to something else?

Managing COVID Symptoms	While cov2 doesn't have any official treatments yet, I figure it doesn't hurt to talk about managing symptoms to make the experience as comfortable as possible. I know many people have their own experience, so please add to this and share what worked for you. This is not medical advice. 1. Managing O2/CO2 - Whether the mechanism that prohibits efficient respiration occurs in the lungs or directly on red blood cells, having too much CO2 and not enough O2 leads to nasty symptoms. Hypercapnia, or excessive CO2 in the blood, can cause severe dizziness, headaches, delirium, muscle spasms, arrhythmia, hr spikes, and other things you don't want. Therefore, conserve your movements if you're having a blood attack! If you can feel your face and hands going numb when you get a glass of water, you should be resting between movements. Do not push yourself here. 2. Managing hypertension - As the cov2 spike protein attacks your ACE2 receptors, it signals your body to increase blood pressure. This is also an uncomfortable feeling. If your hands and feet feel swollen, or you can see your veins popping out, that's why. Avoid excessive salt consumption throughout this journey. Maybe you can also	Managing COVID Symptoms While cov2 doesn't have any official treatments yet, I figure it doesn't hurt to talk about managing symptoms to make the experience as comfortable as possible.

Parosmia 5 weeks after recovered	Hey guys, &amp;#x200B; I want to share my experience and maybe you have the same experience like me. &amp;#x200B; My first symptoms were on April 15th. I had for one evening light fever and for one week dry cough. I was positiv tested 2 weeks later on 29th April. My infection wasnt really bad but i couldnt taste for one week and couldnt smell for 3 weeks at the end of the infection. I got my sense to smell back for like 5 weeks and since 2 weeks I have Parasmia. I have a permanent disgusting smell in my nose and so is my taste also affected. I got another test and yesterday I got the result it was negative. In the next weeks I will see an ENT. &amp;#x200B; Do you have the same experience like me?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Has anyone experienced shooting pains in the breasts? I don’t have a fever but the pain has went from what felt like me ribs then to my upper back between my shoulder blades (almost numb and tingly at times) and now it’s this sharp breast pain. I was treated in the ER but they decided against testing me. I seem to be breathing normally for the most part. I do have a slight cough when my throat needs cleared. Not a lot of pressure in my head but I have been experiencing mild headaches between my eyes. Any advice would be awesome.

Experience of my family who tested positive for anti-bodies	Hi all, Just wanted to share what happened with my family regarding COVID-19. My father (60 yrs) just tested positive for anti-bodies. My mother (56) and sibling (32) are scheduled for anti-body testing in the coming week. We all believe my entire family got the virus in mid-late January, before any official reports of it in the country (we are in Asia). My parents traveled to a different part of the country, after which my mother fell ill. She had all the standard symptoms - dry cough, fever, difficulty breathing. She couldn't sleep a few nights because she of difficulty in breathing. Eventually, she went to the doctor who also couldn't figure out what was wrong with her and gave her some asthma meds and an inhaler (I don't know the details of the meds). That made her dry cough go away. Overall her symptoms lasted about a month. My dad also fell ill right after mom, but his symptoms were milder. Mostly fever and cough. He recovered over a couple of weeks. My sister showed no signs of illness throughout this time. My mom has no pre-existing conditions. My father is diabetic and has high BP.

Got tested today. Waiting for results but planning future actions.	Hi. I’m a healthy 26 yo man and got teste today for COVID. Last week I started feeling some minor symptoms like fatigue, runny nose, headaches and general congestion. Never suffered of a fever and all symptoms have been fading away since Saturday. I dismissed the symptoms as I generally suffer some mild seasonal allergic reactions during august and September every year due to weather changes. Last night I got a call from a close friend I saw during the first weekend of august that he got tested for COVID-19and his result came out positive. I went to the hospital to get tested today and I’m still awaiting for my results. I live with both my parents and two younger sisters at the moment and, while I’m isolating myself as much as possible since yesterday, I didn’t do so throughout the whole past week. I’ve been in constant contact with my family members inside our home and no one has showed any symptoms of any type of respiratory sickness. What should I do if my test comes out positive? What are the chances of others in my household being infected? Due to the technical needs of my home office equipment,	Got tested today. Waiting for results but planning future actions. Hi.

Pink Eye?	Has anyone who tested positive had symptoms of pink eye? Either before, during, or post major symptoms? Last night my sister was complaining her eye was annoying her. So my sister just woke up eye swollen, red, and tell tale signs of pink eye. My dad is a physician in a hospital but doesn’t work with or near any infected patients. I understand there’s a good chance he brought some home to spread to my family. She has a very nasty sickness about a month ago, high fever, dehydrated, and she tested negative for flu. She’s an athlete, very in shape and healthy so not too worried about her. Just wondering if anyone has had any pink eye over the course of their sickness	Pink Eye?

Did the drive up testing do my test right?	Hi all! Quickly question. I got a test Wednesday morning. My sister and I did a drive up - very established and organized - outside a doctors office. Only the nasal swap did not go very deep. I know some don’t have to dig into your brain but it barely tickled and I didn’t feel it between my eyes or anything. Has anyone had a test like that and it still come back positive? Long part - my sister works at a retail store. 3 people within the last week have had positive results. I wasn’t feeling 100% on Monday so I got the earliest test we could get - Wednesday. By Wednesday I had a cough and both of us were running higher temps but not complete fevers. Thursday I felt groggy but my cough was subsiding. Friday I was extremely nauseous all day. Saturday (today) I just had a headache and have slept an abnormal amount for me. I think I definitely have something - probably just a mild case but my sister works at a retail store and the results don’t come back for 7-10 days.

Chronic sinusitis from covid	So I tested positive for covid 43 days ago. The initial symptoms kinda went away. I have my taste amd smell back with weird olfactory nerve symptoms still. I still get some lung issues but i think is mostly asthma from post nasal drip. For most part my issue is still a sinus infection from covid. I tested postivr again on day 30ish and long hauling is pretty common in milder cases. My doc still gave me a course of antibiotics but no success. Who else been dealing sinusitis induced by covid? Before i get people saying sinusitis is different, sinusitis translates to sinus inflammation and viral and bacteria and even allergies can cause it. So yes, im using the term sinusitis induced by covid.	Chronic sinusitis from covid So I tested positive for covid 43 days ago. The initial symptoms kinda went away.

A lot of weird test results, looking for peoples opinions...	I am currently living in an apartment with my girlfriend. My girlfriend works at an apartment complex. 3 weeks ago Covid broke out at her work, couple days later she started to feel a little sick. Nothing serious, minor symptoms. She got tested, tested positive. She didn't trust it, so to be sure she got tested again, it was also positive. I have been with her constantly, sharing the same bed, not wearing masks around her etc. When she received a positive resulted I figured I must have it, since it is so contagious, so I isolated as-well. I also wanted to get tested, so I did about a week and a half after my girlfriend got tested at a rapid result testing place (I have since found out are ~70% accurate and can produce false negatives). Came back negative! I was so confused as I was so sure I got it from my girlfriend. The nurse at the testing centre recommended that I get an antibody test, so I did that also. Again it was NEGATIVE! I just don't understand! My girlfriend definitely caught it and I just can't see how I don't have it. Has anyone had a	A lot of weird test results, looking for peoples opinions...

Just took my test today..	Apparently a co-worker was near someone who tested positive for coronavirus on Monday. I sit with this co-worker every break. Last night I started developing a headache and a sore throat. I thought the headache might have been from lack of sleep the night before, but this morning I woke up to my head pounding and still having a sore throat. I have checked my temperature throughout the day and it ranges from 99.2-100.1. When I went into work yesterday my temperature was 97.6 which is what it usually is when coming into work. I went and got tested today so hopefully the results come back early next week. I am stressed out from missing work especially because I just started working there a month ago, but I think it’s important to make sure I’m either negative or positive to slow the spread of the virus.

Inconclusive test	Hi all, I started showing significant symptoms last Sunday (4/19, 8 days ago). I got tested on Thursday (4/23). Today my results came back as inconclusive. I am going for a retest this afternoon. However, I am feeling a bit better and have not had a fever in over 48 hours. Is this test going to be inaccurate due to timing? How long are individuals testing positive after symptoms have started to resolve?	Inconclusive test Hi all, I started showing significant symptoms last Sunday (4/19, 8 days ago).

Normal X-rays and EKG?	Hey everyone, first off, a little background. 27M, moderately healthy, played sports for years prior to this but was sedentary for the half a year prior. Smoked cigs, swap to juul a year ago and straight up drop everything on 3/25. So I was tested on 3/25, went into urgent care with a shortness of breath and chest tightness. Positive result came back 4/4. The whole time, I had shortness of breath, chest tightness, fatigue, aches all over and weird heart rate problem. I’m currently in week 5, with shortness of breath and sharp chest pain that comes and goes. Frequency is a lot shorter than the first few weeks for sure. It last for hours daily instead of just being constant now. In between that 5 weeks, I’ve went into urgent care 4 times(?).With two x rays, one at week 1 and one at the end of week 4, and did 2 EKG and everything came back normal. No pneumonia, nothing. The pain and aches in my chest were pretty painful though, as well as the shortness of breath. There were quite a lot of nights where I really didn’t sleep well tbh in fear of just not breathing.

Round 2	I live with my partner who is a nurse in the uk, district nurse, so not only does she go to work by London's underground, she's in and out of patients houses which is a recipe for disaster. Guess what? That disaster has now happened but in this case caused by another member of staff who knew she had then came i to work and infected the rest of the team. The infection lasted about a week then I got better. I'm the sort who doesn't like to be beaten so I'll charge around the house doing all kinds of maintenance, painting , fixing things, anything, just as long as i'm occupied and not thinking about. 4 days free of recovering from it and now its back again. Can hardly move from muscle fatigue, extreme headache, tingling in fingers. So if you do have it and recover hold off that bottle of champagne for at least 1.5 weeks.

Did it hit you hard off the bat or build up?	Hey guys I am Covid Positive as is my fiance. We seem to have had different experiences she started with an intense fever that dwindled and shes now feeling much better. I on the other hand never took my temperature but am pretty sure I had a very slight fever and now that has gone away for a couple days. One thing I am noticing though is it seems like my cough which was previously nonexistent is maybe getting worse? As of right now we have both had extremely mild cases, Im just hoping my respiratory issues arent gradually growing. What have peoples experiences been like? Did it all hit you and then get better or did it gradually build up? Did anybody have a cough that intensified and if so for how long? Curious to hear some other stories as fever seems to be the hardest part for most people Ive talked to and fever was never really a big issue for me.	Did it hit you hard off the bat or build up?

Anxiety	I have a question that may be a dumb question: I saw many of my friends ordering from Ubereats, DoorDash, etc., so I decided to do get take out. I asked a lot of questions and they told me to do contactless delivery, which was what I did, and I washed my hands before/after eating. Afterwards, I was reading articles online about doing take out and they mentioned it was better to take the food out of the container/packaging before eating it. I did not do that and now I’m freaking out. What are the chances of anything bad happening to me? I have been diagnosed with OCD, so covid-19 has brought on a lot of paranoia/anxiety for me.

Strange post-covid taste loss	I contracted the virus 3/18, tested positive on 3/23 and haven’t had symptoms since 3/24. Feeling fully recovered the last couple of weeks except for my ability to taste. The strange thing about this is that I can taste things, and have been able to throughout the illness, but it’s like someone turned the volume down. there are some flavors that my palette can pick up on by themselves but it can’t register a complex combination of them. for example, i can taste cheese by itself but if i make like a cheese quesadilla with chicken i can’t taste the concert of flavors and it’s just like chewing on texture with no flavor at all. Anyone else have this? I’ve lost my ability to taste and smell when i’ve had a cold or the flu in the past but never like this, it’s always been absolute and the ability returns a couple of days after i’ve overcome the illness. Worried my tasting abilities will not return.	Strange post-covid taste loss I contracted the virus 3/18, tested positive on 3/23 and haven’t had symptoms since 3/24.

The strange thing about this is that I can taste things, and have been able to throughout the illness, but it’s like someone turned the volume down. there are some flavors that my palette can pick up on by themselves but it can’t register a complex combination of them. for example, i can taste cheese by itself but if i make like a cheese quesadilla with chicken i can’t taste the concert of flavors and it’s just like chewing on texture with no flavor at all. Anyone else have this? I’ve lost my ability to taste and smell when i’ve had a cold or the flu in the past but never like this, it’s always been absolute and the ability returns a couple of days after i’ve overcome the illness. Worried my tasting abilities will not return.	2

I should've tested positive, but i didn't	I live with my parents, and they both were diagnosed with Covid 19 ( they apparently got from some coworker ). 3 weeks ago my father tested positive and one week later my mother as well. And when i did the test, i gladly tested negative. My parents refused to do social distancing ( before they tested positive ), and we usually talk a lot without mask or anything, we don't have any caution because if any of us get covid, then everyone will get it as well. My point is : I interact a lot with my parents, and i definitely should have gotten Covid-19 from them, based in my routine.

Am I responsible for passing on this information?	Hi reddit, I have 2 friends who work as servers at a restaurant in a suburb of Chicago. They just found out that 3 of their fellow servers tested positive for covid, and 2 others are sick likely with covid. All of these people were going into work for multiple days with covid and serving the public. The man who owns and runs the restaurant is trying to suppress the news and actually told the servers with covid not to tell his fellow servers or anyone else, but they said fuck that because they’re not scumbags and they let all the servers know. The owner is actively not following precautions that the fire dept/health service has set in place for them, and is still trying to open the restaurant and bring in workers as if nothing happened. The owner couldn’t care less if people are dying from covid, he just wants his money. Thankfully my friends are not going into work until they get tested, but some others are thinking about going in still (including one person who lives with one of the servers that tested positive).

Is it normal to have positive IgM after a month of having the Covid?	So, first of all, thanks for reading this post. About a month ago i started having a strong headache, lost of smell and taste and some fever. Did the PCR exam and the result was positive for the Covid. After fifteen days, i gor the result of the serology exam and my IgM was 1.1UA/mL and the IgG was 10.0UA/mL. That was in 03/08/20. I did another serology last week and the got the results today. My IgM still shows and 1.1UA/mL the IgG got up to 11.8UA/mL. My question is: is it normal to have this numbers even after a month of having the virus? For what i have been reading, i'm not surprised by the IgG result, but the IgM got me thinking... and i'm worried that i might still be transmissing the damn thing. I need to discuss this to maybe find the more accurate answer... Anyway, thanks again for the help!	Is it normal to have positive IgM after a month of having the Covid?

COVID chest pain or anxiety?	Reading through a few threads on this sub and doing some general internet research, it's clear that anxiety can present like many of the symptoms of COVID-19. My question to people who tested positive is: what was your experience with chest pain and SOB? There's a TL;DR at the end of this ramble... Here is some background on my (32F) situation: Currently working from home. I woke up Friday morning with a mild sore throat. This happens often, and it typically clears within a couple hours of waking up - as was the case this time. That same morning, I took a break from my desk to dig a hole for a large shrub I wanted to plant. It was a really hot day and I hasn't drank anything but coffee. By the time I was done digging, I was understandably lightheaded and short of breath. I finished my task, went into the house and drank a bunch of water. Felt better. A short while later, while sitting at my computer, I suddenly felt a tightness in my chest and felt a little off. My heart was racing a bit so I chalked it up to a mild anxiety attack	COVID chest pain or anxiety?

Got tested today—wondering about symptom progression	So, I’ve had symptoms for roughly a week now. It started with a day or two of just feeling really tired and have hot &amp; cold flashes, but no fever. Developed a sore throat similar to strep (scratchy and kinda burned) on day 3, and it was gone by day 5. Had intense sinus pressure and headaches (felt like a claw pressing against the top and sides of my skull) and super chunky snot coming up for day 6/7. It’s day 8/9 now, and I still have no fever. I feel quite achey, and my throat no longer feels like strep, but more so like I’m being choked by someone. I can still get deep breaths, but my lungs have a ridiculous tension and almost burning sensation, particularly around the bottom edges. I cough occasionally, but only really when I make myself do it. It’s 50/50 productive and non-productive. Everyone else in my house is just as sick, with my grandparents and uncle showing fever &amp; fatigue among all the other symptoms. Do I just have a relatively mild case? Or will symptoms get worse as the timeline develops? What is your experience with that?	Got tested today—wondering about symptom progression So, I’ve had symptoms for roughly a week now.

What can you do for a patient in ICU?	Hi everyone, just wanted to look for some ideas so that we can make my uncle'a stay in the ICU more comfortable to hopefully help him with the recovery process. Other than delivering home cooked meals, anything else you recommend doing? Any suggestions that you have done for your loved ones, or you know of someone doing, please let me know. I am trying to care for my uncle from thousands of miles away. Thank you all. ❤️	What can you do for a patient in ICU?

Help me understand my vitals and symptoms, please.	(26M) Hey guys. I tested positive on May 30th and I’ve been in a constant decline since. The first week wasn’t too bad but now I hurt pretty bad. My symptoms include: Chest and what I’m assuming is heart pain (front and back), a serious cough, headaches, fatigue, occasional nausea and throwing up, the lack of taste and smell (although it’s partially come back), body aches and shortness of breath. I get my vitals taken every day by medics and all of my vitals are normal. Normal temp, normal HR, normal 02, but holy shit I’m hurting bad. Has anyone experienced this? It’s really worrying me.

So unfair	My mother is working daily with Covid patients and on occasion she shares with me some of the stories. Some I will never forget but yesterday’s has my heart broken. 36 year old guy who was a picture of health before he had COVID-19. He spent months in the hospital and is now released but barely able to function. He now has heart failure and lung failure plus sleep apnea. He broke down at his appointment and my mother vowed to do whatever possible to keep him going as he’s a father of 7 children(one being a newborn) He’s our towns best referee and also serves as an actual good soul of police officer. I know stories like this are common but it has completely wrecked me and I just don’t understand how anyone in our state of Georgia refuses to take this seriously. It’s unfair and my heart goes out to anyone impacted so harshly by this pandemic.

When can I go back to work and stuff?	So on Thursday I began feeling a sore throat. It never got bad though it was always just a little scratchy. My husband developed a sore throat too. Both of our sore throats are gone today and we never developed any other symptoms. We checked our Temps regularly and mine stayed around 99. One time it was 99.3 but when I took it 2 more times at that same moment it was 99.0 both times. I am supposed to go back to work tomorrow, and my baby is also supposed to get his vaccines tomorrow and have a very important check up. I already told my work I had a sore throat and am going to call my baby's doctor in the morning before his appointment to let them know. But I'm wondering when it's okay for me to go back to work and to take my baby for his appointment? I took the covid test Saturday but they said it will be 7-10 days for results. I don't want to possibly infect anyone. But at the same time I really don't think I had it as it was just a mild sore throat. Please let me know what you	When can I go back to work and stuff?

New symptom, tingling in hands?	I don’t know if I should be very freaked out. I had lost of smell as my only symptom for about a week now, no cough yet. All of a sudden my fingers started tingling for almost an hour now. It feels like I slept on it, but it’s constant as if they’re going numb but they’re just tingly. Is this something to call the doc on ASAP if they can even do anything? I was concerned because my case had been so mild, random severe symptoms were gonna go my way. I haven’t heard of this one yet but I just got the news I was positive today. It’s something I can endure but not sure if I should be very concerned or how to treat it.

Worried that I potentially exposed my family. What should we be expecting?	I was exposed through a client at work that I noticed was showing symptoms and while we were waiting for her results to get back mine came in as positive. The exposure was between 6/18 to 6/24 but I thought the client had gotten tested and was negative before intake. This evidently was not the case. The weekend in between was Father's Day weekend and I felt fine and thought it would be okay to celebrate with family. Now I'm finding out that I could've exposed them on 6/21. This was the only day I was around them. My positive results are from 6/27 and my only symptom was shortness of breath that I thought was allergy related on 6/19. I struggle with this regularly so I didn't think anything of it. I'm sick to my stomach with worry about my family. Knowing this timeline and the fact that none of my family members have shown any symptoms how likely is it that they are in the clear from the exposure on 6/21? Would I have definitely had it at that point if I tested positive 6/27?	Worried that I potentially exposed my family. What should we be expecting?

26M most likely positive. Anxious and scared. Need some positivity	Hey guys.

Those of you who tested positive/strongly suspect you have it, can you describe the headache the virus gave you?	For me, it was a borderline-migraine. Throbbing headache, that started in the base of the neck, right where your head connects to your spine/neck, as well as right between the eyes/upper sinus, and behind one eye socket only, in my case, the left. It would be a very strong dull/throbbing ache, with random pulsating stabbing pain in the eye area and right between the eyes at random points. Light and noise and movement made it worse. I'm curious to see if others have similar experiences. Maybe an oddly specific headache is another symptom to watch out for. I was never confirmed positive, but I highly suspect I had it. Just FYI.

Nearly fully recovered from Covid	Symptoms started 16 days ago. In the beginning it was a scratchy throat, headache, sinus congestion, and turned into what I thought was a head cold. After the sneezing and snotting started to lessen. I noted I had NO smell. Got tested +. I had a week of a Hines, on and off headaches, shortness of breath, intermittent fevers, etc. Overall I felt lousy. I feel about 90%. Definitely on the upswing. My wife is not recovering as fast as I am; but, she is getting better. On the plus side I have lost a few pounds throughout this. Trying to stay active, stay hydrated, and keep clearing my lungs i felt helped me bunches. Late 40s overweight guy here.	Nearly fully recovered from Covid Symptoms started 16 days ago.

I was a suspected case, but never got tested. Should I consider to eventually get an antibody test?	Hello! I’m a 27M with underlying conditions (asthma and low white blood cell count). Back in March I was exposed to multiple people who had flu-like symptoms when restrictions weren’t that tight yet (I was at two concerts, at a party with someone ill whose partner came back from overseas, at my uni, and also worked in an enclosed space for days with a friend who had an awful bronchitis after visiting a touristic area). After ~15-22 days of my last contact with someone ill, I started to develop an awful migraine that lasted for days. Also nausea, lack of appetite, a sore throat, slight fever and then shortness of breath with a dry cough that lasted for two weeks. I had a lot of trouble breathing and I had to rely on bronchodilators. I also had a very strange metallic taste that seemed to come from my lungs when I breathed. Some of my classmates also developed similar symptoms over the days before the lockdown started. I reached the authorities and I was told to stay home, they monitored me and contacted me three times a day to keep track of my symptoms for 15 days but I never	I was a suspected case, but never got tested.

I had a lot of trouble breathing and I had to rely on bronchodilators. I also had a very strange metallic taste that seemed to come from my lungs when I breathed. Some of my classmates also developed similar symptoms over the days before the lockdown started. I reached the authorities and I was told to stay home, they monitored me and	0

Positive Test. No Symptoms. Random testing	Hey All, Came on here as I randomly tested positive along with 10 other people as a field team offered to come to our location for a group of 30. It’s been 5 days since my nasal swab and the results were all over. Married couples only had one positive and the other negative. Family members were negative except for one. I was shocked for my own test as I had been isolated at home for 2 and a half weeks and only did deliveries. Washed me hands like a mad person and wiped and sprayed all groceries and packages. Anyways, I’m on my 5th day since positive testing and haven’t felt anything. We also took antibody test and that was negative for both IGG and IGM. So I’m just confused if anyone else had this happen. I tested again today to see if it was a false positive. Only symptom I can think of is a random headache that lasted 30min 3 days ago and only subconsciously make myself cough (one throat clearing cough maybe three times a day) for the past 3 days. 35/M.

Fuck my boss	"Backstory: I work retail and generally do to how I work (mostly with suits and in a small area) social distancing is hard however I've tried my best and obviously always wear a mask. My boss knows this and despite this when I came into contact with an infected person at dinner (they found out the next day) he insisted I still return to work. Obviously I said I am isolating and that my college has told me I HAVE to get tested before theyll let me do anything else with regards to school. I got a test done and then called my boss letting him know I would be into work as I am waiting for test results he proceeded to argue with me that I needed to come into work and since it's ""all around us anyway"" i probably am not even infected. I didn't listen as by the time my results came in yesterday the store was closed. Later today when the store opens I'm calling to tell him I am glad I didnt listen to him."

Anyone relapse after recovery (16 days in?)	Flew back from Paris 3/8 and felt chest tightness and cough 3/9. Fever in am of 3/10, 99.9. self isolated and mostly had low grade fever (99.3-100.9) and got tested 3/13, positive result a few days later. I had really bad headaches day 3-7, some diarrhea day 1-2, runny nose day 2-3, just all over the place. Mostly the fever. I gradually began feeling better probably day 9 or so, no fever from day 10. Day 15, yesterday, I left isolation and went crazy busy cooking, cleaning a dirty house from two weeks with four kids and a busy husband. Laundry, cleaning etc. felt really tired at night and had body aches. Day 16 today felt tired in the morning and throughout day, developed a sore throat in afternoon. Took temp in late afternoon to 99.8 again. Ugh. Back into isolation. Sore throat. I’m so disappointed because I tried to be so careful, but i came out and exposed my family to it I guess. The fever had been gone for over five days! I guess this virus stays in your system quite awhile and looks for the slightest weakening in your immune system to regain ground. Ugh. Anyone else??

People don’t understand the fear of Loss of Smell/Taste	Humans rely on their senses. I will admit in the big scheme of symptoms loss of smell and taste seemed mild when I read about it in the news. Until you experience it. It’s frightening and disorienting. I find myself constantly trying to smell different foods, plants, soaps, etc. Although it seems vain and not important during these times. I’m very subconscious now about how my home, car and my body smell. Because I have no idea! I’m thankful I’m alive and healthy. Yet our senses are part of what makes us human. I continue to share the importance of following CDC and local guidance on staying healthy. I do not want anyone else to experience this. We’re all in this together. Yes we are alive and functioning, but it’s ok to be frustrated and upset about our symptoms. More we can spread awareness the better. My heart goes out to all of you.

Beta-blockers during Covid19 recovery	Hello, I guess this isn't an ideal place to ask for medical advice but perhaps there are people who have been in this situation and can help. I've been tested positive on the 25th of September (2 weeks ago) and been experiencing more and more anxiety ever since. Even before getting covid, I've had issues with Health Anxiety (constantly worrying about my health and reacting to every odd physical sensation in my body). This anxiety would sometimes get my heart rate up and get me a little panicky but I got used to it. My Covid19 experience hasn't been too difficult for me: no fever, minimal cough, the only solid symptom was a loss of smell which now returned, but the issue is that I've been having more and more weird sensations in my chest: hard pounding beats, weird gulping feeling, constant feeling as if something was up from my chest to my throat and all of these symptoms have progressed into me being even more anxious and having panic attacks way more often. Having read a bit of everyone's stories on this subreddit, I generally seen people recommending beta-blockers for these symptoms.

Coming down with symptoms second time in 2 months	I first contracted Covid in early April. I shared about it in Reddit, that I got it from going to the doctor’s office. I started coming down with it again this week but I’ve had so little social exposure. I went to the orthopedic doctor twice, grocery store and took precautions (Elevator buttons?) but was lax because I thought I was immune. Wore a mask made out of thin terry cotton for comfort. I’m wondering if this is actually a relapse, viral reactivation? The George Floyd incident has triggered my PTSD from a very similar incident happened to me in 2007. Was awake for 3 days stressed out anxious and run down. It’s milder this time but still kind of horrible. I’m having all the same symptoms but more gastrointestinal which makes me think possibly if I was exposed again that I got it through oral route. Been vomiting and nauseated all morning. Sneezing, eyes and sinuses messed up, sore throat, drenching sweats. Been using zinc, Zicam spray, zithromax eyedrops, and hydroxycloriquine. I live in Austin Texas and went to the city website and try to schedule testing through the public health.

What was your sore throat like?	Yesterday I was drinking water and It went down the wrong pipe and choked on accident for like 10 seconds. Since then I’ve had a weird kind of raspy/cut type of feeling in my throat especially when exerting force or if I tense up my throat. It doesn’t hurt when I swallow. Just wanna know what everyone else’s sore throat was like	What was your sore throat like? Yesterday I was drinking water and It went down the wrong pipe and choked on accident for like 10 seconds.

Mild symptoms and negative test	A couple of weeks ago, I randomly had diarrhea all night long. I didn’t have any other symptoms and my diarrhea subsided the next day. A few days later, my mom had bad diarrhea and felt nauseous the entire day. She started feeling better soon after. Then I had diarrhea again and felt very fatigued and started waking up with lots of phlegm. I had a scratchy throat for a few days where I felt like I could cough but didn’t really need to. As the week went on, my cough got worse but it seemed better during the day. I got tested a week after my first bout of diarrhea and it came back negative but my cough has lasted for 10+ days. I don’t think I had a fever. Could my test have been a false negative or is it more likely that I just have a cold or allergies? I’m wondering if I should get the antibody test done or get tested again.	Mild symptoms and negative test A couple of weeks ago, I randomly had diarrhea all night long.

Extreme tiredness as first symptom?	I don’t have any other symptom except I’ve been extremely, extremely tired the past week ish. Like I could sleep fourteen hours a day if I let myself.

Does this sound like COVID or something else?	Hello, I am a healthy 18 year old male, who has been dealing with some weird symptoms the last few days. 3 days ago I started feeling fatigued and very tired after not getting much sleep the night before. I didn’t think much of it and went to a friends house the next night where I didn’t get much sleep again. Yesterday, I felt fatigued, with nausea, and sinus pressure/ headache. Today, I have the same symptoms and the headache and sinus pressure is still lingering, plus I feel a little achey. I have spent nearly the entire day doing research on Covid. I’m starting to worry I could have it, even though I haven’t experienced a cough or fever yet. Based on what others have said I find it weird how I haven’t experienced many of the other main symptoms. It seems like if I do have it, it could be fairly mild or it’s just taking awhile to progress. I also want to mention that I have severe health anxiety and am constantly worried about if something is wrong with me.

Recovering, finally at four months in.	I'm finally able to step up my exercise without shortness of breath or flareups. I'm happy. It feels as though you are in an altered reality when sick, and slip back to being capable of doing more when you recover. I really attribute some of this to the four-month life span of red blood cells, as Covid also interferes with hemoglobin and I had really, really thick blood. It's finally recycled to healthy blood. Long Haulers, hang in there. Things do improve.	Recovering, finally at four months in. I'm finally able to step up my exercise without shortness of breath or flareups. I'm happy.

Shingles and covid	. Anyone here experience shingles before or during covid? Did it appear before or along side other symptoms? If you had other symptoms what were they and what were their level of severity? I am a 27 year old HS teacher and interact with 50+ students on a given day. Just found out the rash that has been getting worse on my shoulder is shingles. After doing some research it appears shingles can be a subclinical manifestation of covid in asymptotic patients or in patients who have yet to develop more serious symptoms. Thoughts?

Dealing with Covid and parenting littles	My 3yo developed a runny nose and sneezing last Friday. A kid her her classroom has had confirmed strep but I’m worried it might be covid. I started feeling ill Sunday night - headaches, sore throat, diarrhea, low grade fever (99.8). I’ll get tested tomorrow for covid/strep, but in the meantime does anyone have advice for dealing with covid while needing to take care of little kids? I also have a five month old. Oh and a job but let’s pretend that doesn’t exist. I’ve started wearing a KN95 inside, especially around my husband. Any other advice for parenting while sick? I can’t completely isolate because of the baby.	Dealing with Covid and parenting littles My 3yo developed a runny nose and sneezing last Friday.

How to interpret the blood test results?	My father back in South America got a blood tested since he has not been feeling well. He has had symptoms such as shortness of breath, fever, etc. He received the results, but the appointment with the doctor to read the results is in a few days since things there work very slow. There is a part in the results that says: P.C.R Positive 12 MG/DL Does this meant he tested positive for COVID-19? Any help from a doctor, nurse or someone who knows would be greatly appreciate it!

Wife (37 weeks pregnant) and I got Covid19!	Yep that's right I got covid- 19 and gave it to my poor wife who was 37 weeks pregnant at the time. It was terrible not only did have the burden of carrying a child, but the last 3 weeks of pregnancy where you should enjoy your freedom, we were stuck at home quarantining not moving hoping the water doesn't break yet.

Yep that's right I got covid- 19 and gave it to my poor wife who was 37 weeks pregnant at the time. It was terrible not only did have the burden of carrying a child, but the last 3 weeks of pregnancy where you should enjoy your freedom, we were stuck at home quarantining not moving hoping the water doesn't break yet.

How many of you had positive test but no fever?	Title says it all, but I’m wondering, cause I spent several days during the first week of March with some consultants at work who were from Washington state, about 2 weeks ago I started having upper respiratory issues, runny nose, sore throat swollen lymph’s, then last week started with diarrhea and sever exhaustion (to the point where I could barely move) no bad cough to speak of, just every once in a while, and a slightly elevated temp (99 F) , but no fever. My state is basically only testing people who are sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, but was wondering if these symptoms correspond with a very mild case?

How did you come in contact with the virus?	I’m sorry if this question was previously asked but I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone mention how they think they’ve come in contact with the virus. I thought it would be helpful to know. I’ve been as mindful as I can, especially since I’m asthmatic, but I feel like with this information, I can be taking even better precautions. I hope everyone who tested positive and is still recovering feels better soon!	How did you come in contact with the virus?

22[F]still battling the aftermath of Covid for three months now.	Lets start from the beginning: June 16th 2020 I found out I was positive for Covid. It was rough for me in the beginning. I was in disbelief because the week before I got tested at my job,(I work at the hospital) I was negative. Then I did my shifts June 9-12 and got called that week on a Friday saying they had a outbreak at my hospital and needed to get tested again. IN MY SECTION! So of course I took another test and I was Positive. Thankfully, once they told me to get tested I was suppose to go on a road trip in a RV with my whole family. I was leaving that Monday morning for two weeks to Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah. Imagine if I would of went? Imagine if I was ignorant and decided “ehh I’ll do it once I get back” I would of risked so many people’s lives. I live in California so I would of felt TERRIBLE.

Unsure if we had it...and antibodies for youngins	In January, my entire family got sick with what we assumed was a really bad cold (my husband, I and a toddler). Fevers on and off, cough, extreme breathlessness, some stomach issues. Got my 2 year old tested for the flu twice during this time...both negative, doctor said it was a bad virus. I was starting to worry there was something seriously wrong because she couldn’t shake this. It went on for a month. March comes, my work closes. I get a notice from my job late March that a coworker tested positive, so that if we have symptoms, to get tested or see a doctor. I have been feeling burning in my lungs and fatigued for a bit and assume I’m just being a hypochondriac, but now I’m scared. No cough. No fever. I get tested. It’s negative. I’m shocked.

Post-COVID, has anyone had momentary sharp chest and back pains that travel from one side to the other?	I had a sharp pain in my left side of my chest and upper back last night followed by a panic attack. It lasted several minutes and went away and came back this afternoon, migrating from the left side of my body to my right side and back again. Also had a headache near my left ear throughout last night. Is this anxiety induced or post COVID, assuming I even had it? I know heart attacks wouldn't involve sharp pain where I can tell where they're located, so I don't think it's that. Still, the fear's still there.

Covid in January possibly?	In January my family and myself were very ill with some kind of viral chest infection. It all started with me... Day one: I had the feeling of maybe phlegm in my throat. I was coughing all day trying to clear my airway to no avail. Day two: still had the feeling of a lump in my airway. Lots of dry coughing and the realization that I’m becoming sick. Within the next few days my cough became wet, my chest was tight and I was exhausted. All I wanted to do was sleep but every time I did I would wake up soaked in sweat. I went to a walk in doctor who advised me that I had “this weird new viral chest infection that he’s been seeing this month that he’s never really seen before that is making people really sick”. Walking up and down stairs left me breathless and with a horrible burning sensation in my airway (which I still get when I exert myself now in September). My husband also became sick during this time with a bad cough. My son who is 7 also became ill but no cough at all. I took him to our	Covid in January possibly?

Asymptomatic looking for similar experiences - maybe false positive	Hi all! After wearing a mask religiously and working from home I seem to have gotten cucked in what appears to be either a very early stage or a false positive, and I’m looking to find others who had the same experience I was mandated to test by a recent law in Italy that requires all those who fly into the country to test within 48 hours. I was expecting it to come out negative. If you’ve seen a test result, it comes out in three lines : one for the validity of the test, the other two assessing the presence of two sicuro antibodies. First line was full, second was empty, third had some really mild, almost invisible marks and lines, as if at the very early stages. I had to get really close and squint my eyes to even see those traces. Of course I went into immediate isolation and am waiting to take another test in a few days to test if it did spread more or not. I have no fever, cough, anosmia or else. My chest sometimes feels funny, but because I’m here focusing on it it might just be a placebo. Did you or	Asymptomatic looking for similar experiences - maybe false positive Hi all!

Currently have it, asymptomatic. If I'm not immune and I get it again, could I get it worse the second time or is this just how my body reacts to COVID?	It's basically all in the title.

Mental health/sanity when you or family member tests positive	My mom (50) has been sick all day throwing up, very tired, brain fog, no other symptoms yet. She hasn't been able to talk to her doctor yet. I'm worried sick. I've had bad anxiety over the pandemic the past few months and I'm on meds for it. The past week I've had almost this intuitive feeling that someone in the family might get sick soon, and it's been so bad I've had to hold back tears at work. My mom is high risk, and just in the past two hours finding out after coming home from work, I've bawled my eyes out and begged God to let her be okay a few times. Also, there's no way for anyone in my family to self-isolate, so if she is sick with Covid, we are all screwed. I'm so scared.

Anyone have links to articles talking about moderate cases that extend for long periods of time?	"After symptoms of more than 30 days thought I was going crazy, although my doctor confirmed I most likely have ""a really long covid"". I'm her only covid patient. But only anecdotal experiences are what I find online for evidence of really long moderate cases. Does anyone have links to supporting evidence?"

What food/items/acitivites helped you with your recovery from covid?	I'm an anxious person, and part of my anxiety is feeling like I dont have a plan if the worst case scenario happens for me and my family and we contract this virus. For those who are recovered or recovering what food, drinks, things you have done, whatever, do you feel helped? I've read Gatorade and hot baths with vicks helped some, but what other advice would you give to someone that could help them physically and mentally?

Tested positive a week ago; Mild symptoms so far.	Hey guys! M19, 185 lbs, no pre-existing conditions. Exercises 1-2 times a week. Got tested positive a week ago (03/06 - day of PCR test, not the result), but felt kinda sick in 27/05, which I thought it was just a cold, and got only mild symptoms, such as headache, mild fever (not higher than 37.5 C), occasional wet cough, and fatigue. I've been feeling well, for now, only feeling a mild discomfort in my head and cough from time to time. My grandparents got tested 27/05 and came positive too. We all got symptoms in the same time span, but mild. I think we got at the same time, because we had to flew from another city back home, and some passengers were coming from São Paulo, which has many cases. Today is the 5th day since my test, but I'm feeling better so far. Should I test again to see if I have any antibodies ? If the test comes positive, is there any risk of infecting someone?

Worried about exposure prior to seeing girlfriend	I am currently in college and am in a long distance relationship with my gf, who lives 3 hours away. I haven’t seen her in 3 months and had a trip planned to see her this weekend, so as a precaution, I have 2 rapid tests planned for Wednesday and thursday, and I’ve been quarantining as best as I can. On this past Saturday, I was about 6-8 feet away from someone who lives in my dorm. They talked to be for about 30 seconds, and then I went back in my room. Neither of us had masks, and he was talking at a normal volume. Today, that same guy woke up with a fever and cough, and he’s getting tested today. If his test results are positive, what are my chances of getting infected from that interaction and spreading it to my gf? I don’t want to put her at risk for getting sick but I also don’t want to cancel our only chance of seeing each other for a while for no reason.

How did you deal with waiting for results?	Hi all! Currently I am on self quarantine because I started showing flu-like symptoms a week ago. Here is a day by day of my symptoms: Day 1 (10/6) - Sneezing more than usual in the afternoon. Itchy throat before bed. Day 2 (10/7) - Felt feverish and some nasal congestion. By nighttime I had a runny nose, plenty of post nasal drip and had some throat clearing cough. Day 3 (10/8) - Runny nose got better, some nasal congestion. Developed a dry cough. Day 4 (10/9) - Little nasal congestion, dry cough Day 5 (10/9) - Dry cough, with little phlegm Days 6 and 7- Less cough, feels like I just cough to get the phlegm out I live in a tropical country and the weather lately has been weird (hot now then cool and raining later). Could be just a common cold feon changes in weather, I didn't have a fever and had little to no fatigue. But I took a swab anyway and waiting for results.

I'm literally going crazy would love someone to step in and let me know it's not just me. This is my story.	Background info: I grew up in government run facilities so I was inside most of my life which may explain why when I signed myself out of social services care at the age of 18 I developed severe allergies to almost everything. It was manageable till about a few years ago when I couldn't deal with the constant nose clogging at night and the urge to take dayquil almost daily. I saw an ENT who said I have very clogged sinuses and scheduled a surgery (sinuplasty and turbinate reduction) to help me breath also to start allergy shots. After the surgery I could finally breath again and the allergy shots coupled with 2 nasal sprays twice a day and an allergy pill daily seemed to help lots. I'd still get congested but at least I could always breathe through my nose. My family was used to me always complaining of sinus infections though, this is important for later in the story. Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I go and visit my son who lives in the same state and we play with a kite at the park. I take him home then I head home.

Advice/ suggestions please!	I’m currently in the hospital because I tested positive for the virus. A week ago I was tested again, and the results were negative, but they kept me here for precautionary measures. I took the test again last night and my test result was positive again. The doctor said it’s because the virus is still lingering in my body and they are not sure if it is still active (but it’s most likely not). I got sick in May and was in bed for an entire month. Although I felt really terrible for an entire month, I was advised to stay home and not get tested because they didn’t want me to leave the house. I know for a fact the virus is dead because I have no signs of any symptoms, and I travelled for two days with someone and he tested negative twice. I was told I have to stay in the hospital for another 4 days before I get released, and I’m feeling pretty bummed out because I was expecting to leave today.

Nasal Swab Was Not Uncomfortable	Hi all, I was just tested this morning. I have mild symptoms. I’m not sure my swab was done right. It went far up, but not as far as I thought it would and it didn’t hurt. My eye watered one tear and my nose ran a little. Could she have done it wrong? Do they measure/pay attention to how far it goes up? For those who tested positive, were yours uncomfortable?	Nasal Swab Was Not Uncomfortable Hi all, I was just tested this morning.

most likely positive, waiting for results	I had a bad fever and extreme pain everywhere, then I got a bad cough but I really didn’t pay much attention to it. I woke up one night and I can’t taste or smell anything. I completely lost it, I didn’t want to believe it. I started drinking milk, then juice, then soda, which I don’t drink anymore because I’ve been avoiding sugar because I’ve been losing weight and was strictly drinking water. I just wanted to taste something. I chugged hot sauce and vinegar. Just to try and taste something and I got nothing. I went to the ER because I was so scared. They told me I most likely have it since I lost my sense of smell and taste. Next day, I took a test and the doctor also said I’m most likely positive but I’m healthy enough to survive it. I’m only a 19 year old male and I’m legit terrified. I hate the idea of sickness and death, I mean who doesn’t? It’s scary. I can’t eat properly and I can’t enjoy the smell of outside.

Anybody with positive results experiencing heartburn as a symptom?	My symptoms are not indicative of COVID, but they are nothing like anything I have ever experienced before. It's mostly heartburn, a very mild sore throat, mild headaches that won't go away, and body aches. The body aches aren't like a flu, they are like sore muscles after working out or a long shift. I used to get heartburn as a teenager, and occasionally as an adult, but this bout won't quit. I cut out coffee for a week, thinking it might be that, but its been 5 days, so I don't think that's normal.	Anybody with positive results experiencing heartburn as a symptom?

People with tachycardia post-COVID—how long before you recovered? Any tips?	My only remaining symptom is an elevated heart rate, palpitations, and an increase in HR whenever I stand up or do any real activity. Resting HR is in the low 80s usually but it’s been in the 70s and 60s on good days, but there was one day where my RHR was in the 95-105 range for a bit. Standing up and walking around brings my heart rate to the 105-120 range. I’ve been dealing with this for just over a week now (I originally got sick the second of May and had a somewhat mild but still spooky period of two weeks dealing with that). I got really scared when my HR was noticeably elevated that one day and went to the ER where an EKG, chest X-ray, and labs all came back normal except for signs of some dehydration. How long before this symptom went away (if at all) for people who experienced it? Any tips on how to deal with it? I just want life to go back to normal :(	People with tachycardia post-COVID—how long before you recovered? Any tips?

Tested negative for antibodies (LetsGetChecked), but definitely had it	**42M with childhood asthma (but gone for a long time), otherwise healthy and very active/fit. Blood type A+ I recently received a test kit from UnitedHealth Group as part of participating in a survey they’re conducting. It’s provided by “LetsGetChecked”, which I am very unfamiliar with, and I understand is a relatively small start up company. Anyone else participate in this or know anything about LetsGetChecked? I originally started feeling “sick” on the evening of March 7, but for about a week leading up to that, I remember having a pretty runny nose, but otherwise felt fine. I probably felt my worst in the last week of March and the first week of April. However, I’m now at day 98ish, and I would consider myself a long termer. My partner has also had this, and although her experience may not have been quite as bad as mine, she is still dealing with ongoing fatigue and what seems to be arthritic pain. Neither of us ever had fevers or severe coughing, but we both had chest pain, extreme fatigue, and SOB.

Weird incident, wondering if Covid19 or not? Would love to hear from those tested positive if they had a similar experience	A bit long, but any feedback would be GREAT to help me out. Symptom rundown: I was 9 months pregnant, on February 27th I started to feel really tired. Chalked it up to being nearly delivery (due mid March). Felt generally crappy also chalked up to pregnancy February 28th felt very crappy and tired with headache with weird back pains. Thought it was start or labor contractions and went to the hospital. No contractions but high blood pressure (160/106) which lead me to be admitted. Never had blood pressure that high before. They decided to give me medication and induce me. Started to feel like I was coming down with something possibly. February 29th felt incredibly sick. Like the flu times 100. Was told it was due to my blood pressure medication. Received epidural and catheter. Started to feel like I couldn’t breath and get enough air. Was also told it could be from epidural. Had a rough delivery and the entire time after was gasping for air and felt I couldn’t breathe. Again, I was written off that it was due to labor. Had a mildly rough delivery (delivered around 12am) and immediately after birth felt unbelievably sick. Still	Weird incident, wondering if Covid19 or not?

Dad is home from hospital, thought I was clear to visit/take care of him but now I'm confused	My dad first had symptoms exactly 15 days ago (8/17) and was admitted last Tuesday (8/25) because of positive test and shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, GI symptoms, and dehydration. He was discharged Sunday (8/30) with home oxygen and antibiotics among other meds because he still has some lingering pneumonia. He's been fever free for 7 days, and symptoms have all gone away except for shortness of breath with exertion. He told me his doctor said he was clear to be around others if needed, but I just spoke with his outreach nurse and she said that I need to quarantine. I was planning to stay only a few days and then return home where I live with my SO. What should I do?

Headaches for 4 days straight. What does a covid headache feel like?	Hi everyone. I've been experiencing some bad headaches for 4 days now. They started on Friday. The headache is concentrated on the right side of my head and I was experiencing some pain in my right eye yesterday too. I've also been experiencing on an on/off sore throat for a few days now. The headache isn't as bad today, and for the first time in 3 days I'm not taking any Tylenol for it. I don't have any other symptoms. I've been checking my temperature too and I've never had a fever. I'm trying not to freak out here. Part of me thinks these symptoms might've been causing from nerves. I started a new job recently. :/ But I've never had a headache this long before. I do get migraines occasionally, but they never last longer then 2 days. For anyone that has the disease or had it, what did your symptoms first feel like? What were your headaches like?

Possible case - anyone experience anything similar?	Right now I’m a few days into feeling off. My main symptom is shortness of breath with a slight cough that isn’t too bad. The problem is that the shortness of breath is so bad at night that I am unable to sleep laying down without starting to feel lightheaded or just weird after a little while. I’ve never felt anything like this before, and I am nervous that it’s covid. I haven’t left my house in the last 10 or so days. It might be anxiety but I’m really not sure. My spo2 has been 98%+, but I’m still really worried about this. Any help or thoughts would be much appreciated.	Possible case - anyone experience anything similar?

My COVID Experience	I just tested positive for COVID today (along with my son and husband), and wanted to share my experience just in case anyone was concerned about their symptoms and needed so clarity.

When antibodies fade do symptoms reappear?	I had COVID-19 late march with mild flu-like symptoms, including fever. I was only able to get a COVID test a month after initial symptoms and it came back inconclusive, but I was in an area with a high number of cases. I tested positive twice for antibodies. I never had persistent symptoms or relapse that some describe, that is until recently. In the last day or two, I've been feeling exhausted, with a migraine, brain fog, elevated temperature, GI issues, pain in the left armpit and pressure in the chest. I could be wrong but it seems like there is a correlation between long-haulers and negative antibody tests. I am wondering if my symptoms are reappearing because my antibodies might be fading?

Tell me what you think	I am not sure if I’ve had this because I live in Australia where there has been very little covid around and I got sick back in early March. I was really ill for about four days, temperature, aching, GI symptoms, productive cough, wheeze that would wake me up at night, chest pain, tingling/fizzing. The cough and aching persisted for a fortnight and since then I tend to have bouts of the following, low grader fever, extreme dizziness, occasional GI symptoms, ears ringing and aching, chest pains, especially when drinking coffee and sometimes, mild shortness of breath. I know it’s extremely unlikely that I have had it as back in March, if there was any community transmission, it is still unknown. There is some now. Back then, I didn’t meet criteria for testing, but now I do. I have to return to work as a teacher in a week so I can get tested, but regardless, after an exceptional dizzy spell yesterday, they have agreed to test me on Monday. If I did have it, what are the chances of antigen test being positive this far out, in your experience? Do you think this could have been it?

did anyone test positive without ever having left their house? specific questions for covid positive with GI symptoms	I (20f) have been home since March and haven’t left my house since then besides going on walks or drives to nowhere. my dad has been going to work but there’s only two other people there and they all distance. he is also the one that gets groceries/take out but is usually very diligent about everything. 4 days ago I started having some weird bowel movements, not quite diarrhea but definitely not normal for me and multiple times a day. I’m also quite gassy. it’s very possible that this is just food poisoning or something but the times I’ve gotten food poisoning I usually throw up instead. I’ve been reading how GI symptoms can be related to covid so I’m getting a little concerned. this morning I woke up with a slight stuffy nose, very light pressure on my chest and my throat feeling thick (idk how else to describe it).

Waves of malaise	Hi all, 29M here, generally health and athletic. I’m on day 10 of infection and thought I was getting much better. My smell randomly returned, headache started to subside, but still a little nose congestion. At about noon today I was hit with the strangest feeling. Something in between weakness, lightheadedness, and nausea. I don’t know how to describe it. I can feel it in my head, chest, GUT, legs, arms. It seems to have subsided within 20 minutes for the most part, but not completely. Has anyone felt this before?	Waves of malaise Hi all, 29M here, generally health and athletic.

Presumably tested false negative	Without going into every symptom and my illness timeline I am 100% convinced as well as my doctor that I had covid-19.

It's frustrating because I'm the first person at work to have it and everyone's wondering how I caught it but they didn't. I'm in a very high risk Healthcare profession compared to my coworkers. In fact hygienists are #1 on most risk charts – I'm a dental hygienist . Anyway I'm just frustrated with the exhaustion as I've had to call in sick three times now since my symptoms left and I went back to work The lab took six days to send my sample in to the lab and I honestly wonder if it even got tested, as I'm in Nebraska and and Test Nebraska hired a sketchy firm to do their testing and is under scrutiny already.

Any suggestions on what to pack for hospital visit if tested positive?	I do have some symptoms but GP didn’t want to have me checked. Since I’m just getting worse by the day I might have a good argument for diagnosis. As I’m in Singapore a hospital bed is basically guaranteed, even though it might change in short order. As I’m a university student in one of the most reputable (and unforgiving) arts universities in the country, I might have to continue my assignments from my hospital bed. What things should I bring besides this? How many pieces of clothing, underwear, pads/tampons etc? Will I actually have any use for entertainment? Thank you for helping me! I’m hoping to get negative results (and if positive, some respiratory help, breathing has been a hell of a time!)	Any suggestions on what to pack for hospital visit if tested positive?

Which I know it’s because he has a weak immune system. He often has fevers and smokers cough since before covid. He doesn’t take care of his diet. Doesn’t eat right and I know I’m not there so he’s having soft drinks with dinner. I just want to know what else can I do to help him get better? He’s gone to the dr and has been taking meds for the past 3 weeks for his symptoms. He feels better some days and not so good the next.

Has anyone been the subject of harassment due to testing positive?	Someone close to me tested positive despite not having left their house except for a quick errand, always with a mask, always keeping distance, always washing their hands. We still don't know when or how they could have gotten infected. They're asymptomatic and did not at all suspect they could have it. After testing positive, their institution promptly alerted those whom with this person had contact these past few days so that they could quarantine and get tested. However, others have been frantically trying to figure out this person's identity, texting them nonstop and going as far as posting on social media that they should reveal themselves or else they're selfish (even though those involved were already contacted). One of the health professionals involved in the testing process actually revealed my friend's identity without their consent so everybody knows who the positive case was. I understand their concern, but those who might have been exposed where already contacted. This person is under no obligation to reveal their identity if preventive measures were already put in place without the need to disclose personal information. It just makes a stressful situation even more tense. Has anyone experienced anything like this in their	Has anyone been the subject of harassment due to testing positive?

Do you think you got it from food or takeout, and can rule out all other causes?	I’m wondering if there’s anyone who’s been extremely cautious, never had any close calls with unmasked people, mostly staying home, very adamant about hand washing, but ordered takeout and got coronavirus. I’ve been eating takeout recently because it’s largely reported to be safe. I clean all packaging, but consuming the food itself still worries me. Maybe it’s safe, we don’t have documented cases yet, but it’s certainly not an intuitive conclusion that food is safe. Especially uncooked food like sushi for example.

Phantosmia- warped &amp; distorted smell/taste	I can’t take it anymore! Honestly, I tested positive the end of March and completely lost my sense of smell and taste. I regained it slowly over the months and almost appropriately until maybe last month when it really kicked off. I constantly smell a foul odor, it’s something like rotting meat mixed with Clorox disinfecting wipes. I’m a vegetarian too so this really fucking irks me. It’s constant and persistent this smell!! The taste distortion is prevalent as well, I can’t eat like &gt;75% things I used to really enjoy because it tastes burnt or just off in general to the point of being unappetizing. I am fed up. Also, I have been tested for covid WEEKLY since the 3 month diagnosis mark due to mandated testing for my job/profession/facility, and I’ve tested negative each time. Anyone else struggling with this? How do I even deal anymore?	Phantosmia- warped &amp; distorted smell/taste I can’t take it anymore!

Confused about self administered Walgreens testing.	My mom and brother both got tested and my mom's results came back positive. My brother's results haven't come in yet. My entire family (besides me) had a terrible flu around February that they now think was covid19. My mom, after she got her positive result, is convinced it's from her past infection. Do the self administered nasal swabs detect past infection or only current? Thank you! Just very confused on all of this.	Confused about self administered Walgreens testing.

December, February, April: same symptoms	29M, no comorbidities save for a 2mm classic MVP, which never interfered with me riding a bike 5 days a week for the past 3 years though.

Cough (Dec — severe, Feb/Apr — couple coughs daily) 2. Watery stool 1–3 times daily for 3 days after onset 3. Tachycardia of 100–140bpm, especially after getting out of bed or after shower — although this one can be attributed to anxiety I\`ve been through since January; there was a single episode of my bpm reaching 170, called an ambulance that eventually got me tested for corona, waiting for a result 4. Low intermittent fever, never crossed 38°C / 100.4°F; more on the fever below 5. Noises in my bronchi that can only be heard with a stethoscope, leading doctors to diagnose me with bronchitis (that resolves in about a week); nothing whatsoever heard or X-rayed in the lungs 6.

Muscle mass loss during active infection?	Hello, As one of you, I have tested positive for the virus and now with some mild symptoms. I have myalgias, arthralgias, chills and a complete loss of taste and smell.

I went to the dentist, feel overly paranoid that I caught the virus, and want to get this off my chest	I went 4 days ago to the dentist (emergency) in Canada. I felt so naked for 1.5 hours being maskless and having my mouth literally open. They have a fancy machine to suck patient's air out of the room, they all had n95 masks on, and the dentist had a face shield. Even with all this I'm just overly paranoid and I swear my brain is developing psychosomatic covid symptoms. I keep swallowing just to test if I have a sore throat. If I sense any discomfort doing this, I freak out. I keep getting a weird sense of happiness if I can smell or taste things. I keep holding my breathe for 10 seconds to test if my lungs are impacted. This virus has just made me insane. I guess I get to be paranoid for 10 more days.

I’m not sure, a little while. Still do now, but more severe, so would that mean I’m already in my second week, or do you count from when you got sick? I’m either on dat 6(clearly sick) or day 13. I know this hardly matters just nervous. Wife still hasn’t showed any symptoms yet, so I am very thankful for that. Hope everybody is enjoying their Sunday, G-d bless.	Presumed positive yesterday.

I could not smell ammonia, bleach, perfume. Week 1 - 0% No change. Week 2 - 5% Started to smell very, very faint whiffs of things like coffee and tooth paste. Not sure if these whiffs are imaginative or real. Week 3 - 10% Whiffs are increasing in strength. Definently not imaginative anymore. Week 4 - 40% Regained a larger portion of my smell.

Question about testing and possible false negatives	So over the past two weeks I started to develop minor symptoms starting with a sore throat and a dry cough. Began checking my temperature daily and on like day 3 registered a 99.8 only once, since then my temps have been normal range. I don’t know how accurate my thermometer is though since it’s one of those forehead thermometers. Anyway a few days later I was informed that I had been exposed to someone who had ended up testing positive. I was exposed about 7 days before my first symptoms appeared. By this time my girlfriend, who was also exposed to this person, started developing a dry cough and some chest tightness. Because of our positive exposure and pre-existing conditions that put us at higher risk, we were able to get tested. I had been hearing that the nasal swab test can be uncomfortable and they stick it way back in your nose, however when the nurse did the swab on me it didn’t seem like she really went that far back and it wasn’t uncomfortable at all, I barely even felt it. From what I remember the swab wasn’t that large like I had expected.

But like...truly asymptomatic (36f/33m)	I’m seeing a lot of posts on this sub saying they were asymptomatic...except for loss of taste and smell, headaches, fatigue etc. Loss of taste and smell is truly a major characteristic of Covid. My husband and I tested positive on 7/23 after testing in a mobile site on 7/20. We’ve both tested negative since. No symptoms at all. If we hadn’t been tested, we truly would never have known, and I would be worried about “when”. I wouldn’t be surprised if final numbers come out before a vaccine where it’s 100-150 million Americans got it and didn’t even know.

My husband and I tested positive on 7/23 after testing in a mobile site on 7/20. We’ve both tested negative since. No symptoms at all. If we hadn’t been tested, we truly would never have known, and I would be worried about “when”.

Does it really make sense to limit store hours?	I always wondered how it makes sense to limit store hours during the coronavirus. By doing so wouldn’t you be concentrating more shoppers in the stores at a given time. I’m thinking it would be better to have store opened for longer so people can go at different times and so having less dense stores...they argue that they need extra time for cleaning but what instead of cleaning at night just have periodic cleaning of stores by sections during the day.

Should I get tested?	Symptoms are: Day 1: woke up with a sore throat, constantly felt the need to clear mucus from my throat. I got some mucus occasionally when I cleared. Day 2: woke up with a slightly better sore throat, but a hoarse voice. I voluntarily cough every 30 minutes to an hour and some mucus usually comes out. It's very light green. No history of allergies, 21 years old	Should I get tested? Symptoms are: Day 1: woke up with a sore throat, constantly felt the need to clear mucus from my throat.

Lungs feel cold? Worried	Hey guys, I’ve had mild nausea/fever/diarrhea about a week ago which all went away and got better. Then I developed a very mild sore throat that’s barely noticeable but still unpleasant, while I no longer seem to be having a fever I’ve had some stabbing pain in my ribs area I’ve been noticing a weird feeling of something like it’s cold inside my lungs. I don’t know if I’m just being dramatic but I also don’t know if I should go get a Covid test. I’m gonna start isolating from my family just in case and I’ll see how it progresses from here.

My mild experience	I thought I'd give my experience with covid, as much of what I read on here is a little doomy. This thing affects people so differently. While it can be serious, it can also be mild. I found that it gave me comfort to read others' accounts, no matter how different, so here you go. I am 27, 5'5, 140 lbs. Husband is 29, 5'10, 210. Neither of us have underlying conditions. We are healthy, exercise multiple times a week, but we do like to drink, and we are non-smokers. I was exposed on Wednesday, Aug. 26. I started having a little bit of a tickle in my throat on Sunday Aug. 30 while I was playing golf with my husband. I have bad allergies, so I chalked it up to being outside for 5 hours. The next night, Monday, Aug. 31, I got word that some of the people I was with on Wednesday started showing symptoms. I immediately scheduled a test for the next day. I felt congested that day, but again, thought it was allergies. The day I got tested, my congestion started to get worse.

Victim of another virus that spreads when we show each other love, kindness, and affection. When we are most human.	Hi there, I was diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, Sars-cov-2, on July 23rd, 2020. This is my timeline/story. I'm an emergency veterinary technician (aka animal nurse) at a very busy 24/7 emergency and referral animal hospital. We have had an increase in the number of patients/clients since this pandemic started. Staffing has been a huge issue and the number of sick animals has been overwhelming. I have worked there for 6 years and have never seen so many cages filled with critical cases. Since February, I have easily hit over 50+ hours every week because of the volume of cases. My mother was admitted to the ICU on July 8th, 2020 and placed on a ventilator. (NOT COVID RELATED!) She was diagnosed with sepsis and Wernicke's Encephalopathy. (Aka her brain was swelling, causing hallucinations, because she was lacking an essential vitamin not produced by the body, and was septic from a horrific UTI). I have been very diligent about washing my hands, not traveling (I haven't even had the time to travel due to my work), wearing a mask 24/7 while at work, practicing social distancing, and only leaving the house when needing groceries.

Tested two days ago, waiting for results. Mild symptoms	My symptoms started five days ago and seem to be pretty mild. I'm not sure if I am overreacting, but I am wondering if anyone else has symptoms similar to me? 7/19 later in the evening a sore throat came out of no where, I'm a smoker so I didn't think much of it. Ended up sleeping for about 12 hours that night and could barely keep my eyes open. 7/20 sore throat still lingering, hard time waking up in the morning and napped a lot throughout the day. 7/21 sore throat still, muscles and joints achy, but fatigue was not so bad. 7/22 woke up at 3am with one of the worst upset stomachs I have ever had and diarrhea which lasted into late morning. Sore throat subsides a little, but my nose feels dry and raw. Joint pain getting worse but manageable. Got tested at 1pm and on my way home felt incredibly groggy and out of it. Arms feel heavy and knees hurt down into my calves. Around 5pm I have what feel like terrible menstrual cramps for hours. 7/23 wake up again at 3am with upset stomach and diarrhea that lasts into the morning.

if you were sick, but the person you live with already recovered, would you still isolate from them?	Just wondering. I don't know if I have it, yet - just got tested today. They say I should hear back in 3 days. In the meantime I'm wondering if I should isolate myself from my SO, whom I live with. He doesn't think I need to. He had it back in March, and made a full recovery. But I'm so confused, with all the news - saying we're immune after having it, but then some reinfections have happened...are reinfections likely? How likely? Should I isolate just to be safe? If I don't isolate from him, would there be any danger, risk, of him spreading it to others even if he isn't reinfected himself? (he works with two other guys and he can't socially distance from them). I appreciate any help here.	if you were sick, but the person you live with already recovered, would you still isolate from them? Just wondering.

Cleared but skeptical if I'm completely healed, squeaking after exercising.	"Was infected on March. 12. Things were mild and all symptoms lifted around March. 23rd (11 days). I decided to stay in quarantine for another 18 days. My government told me, ""people who are diagnosed with COVID-19 can come out of self-isolation 10 days post onset of symptoms as cases no longer test positive at that point. "" Total length from quarantine and reintroduction into society was 35 days. I live with someone who is immocomprimised. I haven't been able to exercise for a long time so yesterday I finally did but man did I get winded. It physically hurt. When I would breathe out, it sounded like squeaking. This lasted until I went to bed. Woke up today and my nose is partially stuffed. Should I return to isolation or is this just the result of my body not being used for a month or so/paranoia?"

guess who tried vaping after 2 days of feeling significantly better.	My heart issues I had in the past couple weeks was completely gone.

It started with a tickle	Sunday morning I had a tickle in my throat that kept causing me to cough. I felt mostly fine otherwise but knowing that was a symptom I was a little worried. No once close to me was positive but because I have little ones in school I wanted to be careful. Monday I felt like I maybe had a mild headache along with the cough and possible body aches. So I tested Monday afternoon. Today (Tuesday) my symptoms have remained largely the same with mild cough and chest pain, mild headache, mild body aches. I thought I felt a little sore throat too. Tylenol manages it pretty well. So now I’m quarantined with my 5 and 6 year old. This should be interesting.

Progression of Symptoms?	Hello all! I hope everybody is doing well and staying safe. I went and got tested today after 5 days of symptoms. Fatigue, lack of efficacy, headaches, soreness, and difficulty breathing from time to time. (MAJOR brain fog as well, no fever though). As I await my results, I was wondering what has been the progression of symptoms for you guys? If I am COVID positive, should I expect potentially more in the coming days? I know cases vary, but I just want to get an idea of what I might have to deal with. Thank you!	Progression of Symptoms? Hello all! I hope everybody is doing well and staying safe.

Anyone like me?	Backstory: I was exposed by a confirmed positive. On Thursday 9/10 I was feeling a bit run down, Saturday 9/12 I had a stuffy nose and got tested. Positive. Stuffy nose has since gone away, and only symptom to have come was the loss of smell and taste (on Monday). No fever, no cough. Does this sound like anyone else? I haven’t needed to take any medication. Is it just too early or maybe I’m a lucky one to not develop any bad symptoms? I know no one can tell the future, simply looking for others who started this crap with a similar experience. 34/F, no health conditions, healthy weight, avid exerciser.	Anyone like me?

Gastrointestinal issues as a sign?	Hey y’all! So, I’ve been having nausea and diarrhea all day today, as well as a low fever and chills.

Should I get tested if these symptoms persist tomorrow? I feel like I may be overreacting since I’ve only had this issue for a day and it could be a stomach bug, but I want advice please!! Thanks!

Anyone else lingering GI issues?	I was tested negative but presumed positive.

I suppose it could be the antibiotics did a number on me? I finished them at the end of week 4. I can’t eat anything but bland food and not too often. I ate chocolate last night because I’m an idiot and I’m still paying for it this morning and now the fever spiked. Is this anyone else?

What were the VERY early symptoms?	I hear a family member cough once and freak out. For those of you who have tested positive, did you have incredibly minor symptoms like this that you wrote off?

This happens to me year round, but I’m just being paranoid as usual. It seems like the biggest sign is fever and it should be especially telling now that it’s summer and a fever can’t just blend in with regular sickness as easily now. My mom’s sister’s friends recently came back from a trip to Washington and apparently they have fevers now, so I’m assuming they have it. My mom’s sister apparently had brunch with them after they got back?? I didn’t decide this... Idk I’m just super paranoid and having legitimate evidence to worry makes it even worse.

This happens to me year round, but I’m just being paranoid as usual. It seems like the biggest sign is fever and it should be especially telling now that it’s summer and a fever can’t just blend in with regular sickness as easily now. My mom’s sister’s friends recently came back from a trip to Washington and apparently they have fevers now, so I’m assuming they have it. My mom’s sister apparently had brunch with them after they got back?? I didn’t decide this... Idk I’m just super paranoid and having legitimate evidence to worry makes it even worse. My mom has had	0

Started feeling crappy 2 days ago	24 y/o healthy male, I exercise regularly and eat relatively healthy. Felt like I was about to faint yesterday in the heat, cold sweat &amp; chills began. Muscle soreness for the past 3-5 days. Slight cough that I attributed to allergies. I am resting as much as possible &amp; isolating myself. Haven’t been taking any meds. I went to the ER last night due to the fatigue, nausea, cold sweat &amp; lightheadedness. Doctor said I should be fine, my vitals were normal but I am exhibiting viral infection symptoms. I declined the covid-19 test due to the discomfort that comes from a cotton swab poking my brain lol. Could be cold, flu, stomach bug or covid-19. Will update soon.

When to take someone to the hospital.	My mom, age 54, 20-25 pounds over weight and diabetic (type 2) is showing symptoms of covid. Today she woke up with pink eye (or whatever else makes your eye all red), headache and now her whole body aches/hurts and she’s feeling congested with a slight pressure in her chest. I had her go get tested, I went with her but in separate cars. They said they would call in 2 days or less only if she were positive. She says her ears hurt now. I gave her a thermometer, the finger oxygen/pulse reader thing (can’t remember it’s name) and a Fitbit to monitor her. She says she’s not having trouble breathing and oxygen has been 97-98 when she checks it. For those who had to take someone to the hospital or who ended up going yourself. When do I take her? Thank you.	When to take someone to the hospital. My mom, age 54, 20-25 pounds over weight and diabetic (type 2) is showing symptoms of covid.

Me and my husband positive. Have a baby with no symptoms	I got sick around March 20th. It was bad but I'm not gonna go into detail. They did an xray and I have advanced pneumonia. My husband got sick much later. He's way better than me, but still sick. Now, we have a 11 month old baby. What would happen to the baby if both of us end up in the hospital? My doctor said not to bring anyone into this house. (to look after the baby) And he also said not to take the baby somewhere else so someone can care for the baby either. He said the baby has to be quarantined if both of us go to a hospital. But how? Where?	Me and my husband positive. Have a baby with no symptoms I got sick around March 20th.

How quickly did your symptoms develop/get worse?	"I've had a dry nagging cough, dry sinuses and at times post nasal drip for 2 or 3 days. Just tested again but won't have results for a week.

What are the chances I may have had an asymptomatic case of coronavirus	Back in November, my mum, who is a diabetic, got really ill for nearly 8 weeks despite having an annual flu jab. No kinds of medication eased her symptoms, she even ended up with some form of blister in her ear. Thing is, nobody else at home came down with anything. I didn't because I had the flu shot, too. But only my mum got affected even though she had the flu shot 2 months prior. Back in January, my girlfriend was having synptoms of dyspnoea, which had come and gone over a short period of time. Nobody knew what to make of it. Since around March/April time, I've had episodes where I feel like I've been feeling breathless. Even when I've been asleep I've been woken up sometimes in the middle of the night by this kind of feeling. I know despite being asymptomatic, you don't always escape the after effects of it like scarring on the lungs, feeling weak. etc. Another thing I generally feel like is every morning I am finding it harder to wake up, even on weekends when I am not at work, I feel really weak. I even get days where I feel weak	What are the chances I may have had an asymptomatic case of coronavirus Back in November, my mum, who is a diabetic, got really ill for nearly 8 weeks despite having an annual flu jab.

I am pretty sure I have COVID	While I only have the exhaustion and the diarrhea I am getting nervous about having the virus. Haven’t had the shits like this in as long as I can remember. And I slept two nights ago, all day yesterday (with the exception of waiting in line for 3 hours for a COVID test), all then all night last night until 10:00 am this morning. They say that there will be a test result emailed to me within the next few days. I am getting really fucking nervous.

I am an asthmatic and have been very careful about this virus but I went to a dental cleaning and 3 days later had an incredibly sore throat and a week after I went to the ER and was diagnosed with COVID-19 related pneumonia based on ground glass opacity seen in my left lobe. I was given dexamethosone and sent home to quarantine. A week in and I am not sleeping as much but the coughing and chest pain is worse and I am running a low grade fever with chills. My nasal swab came back negative so my parents and siblings (all live in MN, I live in VA with my husband and 2 kids) think I ""only"" have pneumonia and basically just don't care. Haven't even checked in on me but once since I got home from the hospital. The doctors told me they have had a lot of false negatives, especially when it is early in the infection and that my xrays are very indicative of COVID-19 along with the other symptoms.

My smell and taste are still not functioning normally.	I started showing symptoms for the virus on March 18th and they didn’t really go away until mid April. However, the loss of my smell and taste have still not come back. I get GI issues and the occasional body ache also. The only thing I can smell or taste is this really unpleasant aroma that is like rotting food. Any time I eat citrus or carbs, that awful taste/smell is back. Other than that, I still cannot taste or smell properly. I am really concerned as it has been almost 3 months since I first showed symptoms. Any ideas or is anyone else experiencing this?

Felt body pains, aches and lost taste of smell and sense for a week. Experienced chest pains, headaches, and legs issues for a week. This virus doesn't discriminate; young or old.

My sleep pattern was completely shattered for 2 weeks. The last three days, i've gotten amazing rest as the virus is beginning to lose the battle. KEEP FIGHTING!!!!

Came back as possible pneumonia - how deadly is covid pnemonia?	30sM / No pre-existing conditions / Started having symptoms 3/23, progressively been worse since with burning chest, breathing difficulties, fever, and extreme fatigue. Here is a copy-paste from the office: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are preserved. There is a small/vague patchy consolidation in the right middle lobe. Otherwise the lungs are clear. No pleural effusion, no mass, edema or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal, hilar contours are appropriate. No acute ossific findings. Unremarkable soft tissues. IMPRESSION: Small/vague right middle lobe consolidation \---- When I look this up online, it says that the middle lobe consolidation is caused by pneumonia, which I've found is a specific type of pnemonia that is resistant to antibiotics. Had severe breathing difficulties for several days, was unable to sleep for 2 days. Literally thought I was going to die. Still feel like I won't make it through and it will get worse every day until I have to be intubed. Have a call with doctor tomorrow at 3 to discuss, but not feeling great about this.

When will this end?	I thought a couple weeks ago I had fully recovered, and I may be. But my joints will not stop hurting. Also, I know this seems weird but certain parts if my skin is extremely sensitive(painful to touch) now. Has anyone else having these types of issues? And of course I woke up Monday feeling like I'm getting sick again. It worries me because 1. I never got a positive test (did the rapid test about 3-4weeks into the initial onset). 2. I worry that if I wasn't really severe could I get it again? Edit: At the first part of March I had low grade fever, slight cough, headaches, chest pain and tightness and GI issues for about 8+ weeks. I think from what I have read I should be over all of it?

Oxygen levels drop significantly while “dozing” off to sleep	Hi everyone. It has been 4 weeks since I tested positive and all my symptoms have recovered except my shortness of breath. Throughout the day it feels like I am not getting full breaths and have the sensation of shortness of breath but my oxygen levels via oximeter usually never dip below 94 and usually remain around 98. However when it comes to bed time, as I lay down or go on my side and begin to “doze off” my oxygen will dip into the 80s and I feel it and then begin breathing to try and get it back up. It is really frightening to me because I don’t know what to do and why this is happening. Has anyone had this? Has anyone’s lungs improved overtime? I have gone on several hikes and my oxygen is above 95 when I get back home. Should I visit the ER? I don’t know what to do. Thank you. Hope everyone is staying safe.

COVID Positive in Prison	I just spoke with my prison penpal, and he's recovering from COVID. He told me that they're just letting the virus spread through the prison. He said that the virus came in with the kitchen supply deliveries, and spread through the kitchen staff. It's absolutely inhumane to neglect basic health protection and food hygiene like this. While he was sick he was sent to a quarantine ward. Every day they were checking vitals and giving ibuprofen. It really broke my heart to hear his experience. I can't imagine having to deal with this sickness with so few resources and so little communication with other people and the outside world. I don't know what I would do without all of you on this subreddit. He was so happy to speak to another COVID survivor about the experience. Even though he's only been better for about 3 weeks, he seems to have all the problems that us long haulers have. I told him what I know, what the doctor told me, what I've read here, what I've tried, in the hopes that it might help him. Unfortunately the available medical care is limited to aspirin, and not much else. My heart goes	COVID Positive in Prison I just spoke with my prison penpal, and he's recovering from COVID.

Could I have had covid in January?	I go to a large college in the US. I started feeling sick a little after MLK weekend. Day 1-2 Headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, all towards the end of the day. Seemed like a normal cold. Day 3 Woke up feeling terrible, throwing up and skipped class to rest, no appetite Day 4 Felt better when I woke up, went to class, then it all came back. Chills, stuffed nose, etc. Day 5-6 Got a horrible cough, like nothing I’d ever had before. Liek it was impossible to clear my throat. I coughed so hard that I threw up mid cough all over the dorm floor. Not fun. I finally bought a thermometer and found out I had a ~100.5. Started to feel fluid in my lungs when I breathed in and it was difficult to take a full breath without my chest feeling tight. Day 7 Went to the doctor. They took my temperature, looked at my throat with a light and told me I had pharyngitis. Day 8-12 Every day I’d wake up normal, then towards the end of the day my fever would come back.

Timeline and List of Symptoms - 26F Presumed Positive	I wanted to write this to help inform anyone who might be in a similar situation. Here’s my timeline from first onset and a list of symptoms. I have not been tested but I was officially diagnosed as positive by a doctor based on my symptoms – she said it’s highly unlikely that I don’t have it. They’re apparently only testing health care workers in my province so I’m not eligible. I just turned 26 and I’m quite healthy and fit with no risk factors. April 28: Woke up tired and feeling “off” with a slightly sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in my neck. I coughed every now and then but nothing serious. In the evening, I suddenly got *extremely* fatigued – it was difficult to stand up without support. At the same time, I developed severe muscle and joint pain. It was the worst in my lower back and legs. It was weird how rapid the onset was. The pain became so bad that I couldn’t sleep for hours and I also had the chills. I just couldn’t get warm.

Dumb question, but can someone elaborate on the sore throat?	"I think my allergies went full rampant yesterday. Couldnt stop sneezing. Had a lot of nasal drainage and my throat is sore.

Opinions on this ?	So back on the 28th of feb my housemate returned from London with sob, dry cough and fever. A few days later my symptoms began with a post nasal drip, then going into extremely blocked nose, sneezing, headache, sore throat, loss of appetite and taste, mild Diarrea, nausea, runny nose and fatigue. I then had these symptoms for 4/5 days but assumed it was a head cold, but there was one night I had sweats and woke up with chills and feeling very hot, the next day I was fine. During the time I was ill I came back to my mums to recover and fast forward about a week later my mum has symptoms and tests positive for coronavirus, now I am a key worker in a supermarket and I’m sick of feeling anxious everyday about if I’m going to catch it. My mum is certain that Myself and my house mate had it and I gave it to her. What do you all think?	Opinions on this ?

Can someone be contagious the very first day they get exposed to the virus?	My dad was exposed to someone who had COVID-19 on Monday, it was deemed very low risk exposure by the healthy unit because my dad talked to this man about 2-3 feet apart, didn’t really look him in the face, and then only talked to him for under 2 minutes. I went to my boyfriends house on Tuesday after being home and not around my dad too much on Monday, but now I’m terrified because I could have spread it to his family. I wasn’t around my dad very close for more than an hour all of Monday but I did touch things he touched the previous night (he didn’t cough or anything at all) Can you be contagious and pass it on within 12 hours of being exposed IF you have it? We are waiting for my dads swab test he got done today.	Can someone be contagious the very first day they get exposed to the virus?

Bicuspid aortic valve and covid19	I found out that I have an bicuspid aortic valve years ago when volunteering for an EKG test (I was an EMT). This was hereditary so I’ve been born with it.

I've been ""recovered"" for a while, but today I decided to step behind the grill and made food for a decent sized party. I inhaled a lot of smoke, and for someone recovering from a respiratory/cardiovascular disease, with post viral fatigue and God knows what else, then maybe it wasn't such a great idea. I don't grill at all, maybe once a year, so I don't think it should be too much of a risk but I don't know. Am I just getting worked up for nothing, or is there a real risk here?"	"Bad idea?

A Wet Cough	Hey all, Brief background, 32m living alone in the UK. No real health issues, a tad overweight but I wouldn’t really call it out for this. Mostly self isolating but did shop for some food a couple times since basically being home since the 13th of March and going on some quiet alone walks. Got sinus problems (dry eyes, a blocked ear) starting on the 5th of April which I am prone to so I largely ignored and treated with olive oil in my ear etc. Around then I had a little bit of diarrhea and didn’t pay much mind of it. Anyway evening of the 7th rolls around, fever, gasping awake, headaches, chest pressure, chills and my calves locking up. I phone the NHS, they take some convincing without the cough so I finally talk to a doctor, they say sounds like covid, call your GP. GP agrees, but you know I can talk and walk and cook and eat so, I’m lucky you know? Few days roll on, and it’s mostly the same spiking heavily the evening of the 13th, to the point where I start gasping and give myself a panic attack and emergency services is called	A Wet Cough Hey all, Brief background, 32m living alone in the UK.

How long is it recommended that I quarantine?	"About two weeks ago (Saturday July 11th) I was exposed to someone who was positive for covid at a graduation party and self isolated in my room as soon as I found out (Last Wednesday). Then I got tested last Thursday and found out I was positive that Sunday. Thankfully no-one else in my family tested positive and so far I have no symptoms whatsoever. That being said I was wondering when would it be safe for me to stop isolating? My doctor told me that 10 days from when I was exposed was the minimum, but when I look online I see times such as ""14 days after exposure"", ""10 days after positive test"", 3 days after symptoms subside"". I really don't want to mess with getting anyone infected, and at the same time I would very much like to go back to work before I ship out to college and my boss just asked if I would be at work Monday so it's a little frustrating to see all the conflicting times for how long one should quarantine."

Symptoms after flu	Symptoms after flu I’ve been having some very uncomfortable symptoms since getting sick 4-5 months ago. The past two weeks have been the worst. My symptoms are: 1. Throbbing heavy head pressure when waking up (gets better as the day goes by but always there...makes me nauseous and feel like throwing up) 2. Stiff neck and shoulders when waking up (like I had just worked out) 3. Facial tension and full ears when waking up (especially on the side I’ve slept on) 4. Blood pooling into my knees and legs when laying down for long periods of time 5. Extreme dizziness after eating a large meal (almost feel like passing out, I start losing my balance) 6. If I stand up anytime I feel weak and fatigued, especially after eating, I begin to get extremely lightheaded, with heavy heavy head pressure and my heart rate spikes up extremely fast (only time I really deal with dramatic heart rate increase...forces me to run cold water on my eyes to relax my heart rate) 7. Constantly feel like I’m on a boat or somewhat drunk (afraid time move too fast for fear of dizziness and nausea) 8. Tachycardia and heart palpitations anytime	Symptoms after flu Symptoms after flu I’ve been having some very uncomfortable symptoms since getting sick 4-5 months ago.

GI issues 7-8 weeks in	Hello, been dealing with symptoms for around 55 days. The newest one to come and put a damper on my recovery is bad upset stomach and diarrhea. It’s been about 3 full days now and stomach is still pretty sensitive and dull feeling in my gut. I am getting tested this week for covid-19, doctor thinks I’ll test negative because it’s been so long since my original symptoms started, but the whole upset stomach one is new and not even sure it’s related.

Horrible sore throat	I ended up going to urgent care today because I woke up with a horrible sore throat and the whole back of my neck was achy and sore. They tested me for strep but instead of swabbing the back of my throat the nurse swabbed the side of my tongue and never made it far enough to get my throat. I don’t understand it. Of course it came back negative: they then swabbed me for covid as a precaution. Told me to take allergy medicine and cough drops for my throat as if I haven’t been fucking doing that for two days now. I followed up with my regular doctor for a second opinion who said it sounds just like strep and she called me in some antibiotics. She also said it very well could be COVID because it’s rampant in my state. I’m hoping they work because this is miserable.

False negative - has anyone had the virus and not passed on to household?	My head is all over the place right now. Last Friday (2nd October) I developed a dry, chesty cough. I had no other symptoms than this. I got tested the following day (3rd October). The next day I got a negative result and so resumed with my family and work life as normal. However, by Thursday I still had this continuous cough. Yesterday I decided to get tested again just to be sure. Today I got my positive result. I am freaking out because I live with my parents, both of whom are elderly. Has anyone experienced having the virus and NOT passing it on to household members? I need a little bit of hope here.

Interesting development with mom??	My mother is currently stuck in an elderly care facility due to an injury back in January where she is supposed to be doing rehab to get back to walking. She is 63 and healthy prior (asides from diabetes). During her stay in this facility, she developed coronavirus (mind you this facility hasn’t done the best job when it comes to managing and containing this virus and has 8 dead so far). Anyway, mom has been in quarantine for about a month (once because they thought she was positive and they decided to keep her in her quarantined room, then decided to single out suspected infected in one wing of the facility.). While in that second room, she contracted it from an aide and has had it roughly a week and half. Today, I spoke with her and she said they gave her an antibiotic last night and have administered it three times that is supposed to “cure or help the virus” and she told me she feels like a completely different person. Anyone have an encounter similar to a “cure” or something that adversely affected the virus?	Interesting development with mom??

severe chest pain after recovery?	I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience to me with chest pain after recovering from COVID? For some background: I tested positive for COVID in July, and when I got tested I had no symptoms. I got the result a week later, and shortly thereafter I did start to get mild chest pain every so often but that was about it. I followed the quarantine and isolation guidelines that were given to me and I was even able to donate plasma in August, however I was a bit surprised to find that I tested negative for antibodies when I checked a few days later. I had to go move my stuff into a new place and out of caution since I tested negative for antibodies I got tested for COVID again, and was pleased to see that I tested negative at the end of August. Now for a while after I quarantined things went back to normal again for me and I felt fine, no symptoms whatsoever. But every so often I would start to get the chest pain again.

Sore throat, hurts to swallow, no other symptoms so far - what to do?	I live in Northern California, where there has been pretty bad air quality the past couple of days due to the number and intensity of fires surrounding us, and yesterday, I started having a slightly sore throat (originally started on one side) that I thought might have just been due to inhaling smoke. But now, it feels like it's not just one sided, it's gotten painful to swallow, and I'm getting quite worried. I live with my older dad (early 70s), tried to stay away from him yesterday, but since we've been dealing with both a heat wave and bad air quality, we've been keeping the windows closed and fans have been running all around the house (which pretty much means if I've got it, there's a good chance he's gotten exposed by now). Is this possibly covid? Should I go and get tested? Keep my room closed and keep ice on hand to try to lower my room's temperature? I feel really stupid right now... because the only place I've been these past 5 months is from my sister's place, where my dad and I have been going to take occasional showers since our hot water has been out	Sore throat, hurts to swallow, no other symptoms so far - what to do?

I don’t have any mucus, stuffy nose or sinus symptoms. Is my sense of smell ever going to come back?? It’s been weeks without smelling and it’s freaking me out.

Question about sinus pressure.	I’ve been sick exactly 2 weeks today. It’s gotten better but the one thing I cannot seem to shake is the sinus pressure.

Covid but no cough, fever?	I'm on day 6 since my first Covid symptom. I had one coughing fit 3 days ago and that was it. I haven't had a fever. Main symptoms are one day of GI issues, irritated nostrils (mostly gone now), and easily get winded when up and about. I've had some intermittant chest pain that could be gas related due to GI problems; pain is infrequent, short and doesn't get any worse with a deep breath. I'm curious if anyone developed a cough/fever after day 6? I know things can go haywire around Day 8, but I'm hoping I avoid that.	Covid but no cough, fever?

Looking for advice for a long term sore throat/cough I've had as a result of COVID.	I believe caught the virus early, when people were first hoarding toilet paper and the like. I was sick for roughly 2 months, with severe cold like symptoms. No shortness of breath or loss of smell, but most of the other symptoms. No hospitalization. While the bulk of the symptoms have long since disappeared, I've had a painful sore throat and a mild cough since then. It's been roughly 6+ months now. I've seen 4 different doctors (including a specialist), but none of them have been able to help. I did get tested, but by the time testing was available to me, it had already been a few months, and I tested negative (not antibody test). I assume it was COVID nonetheless due to the extremely long term throat issues I've been having, and the timing of my initial illness. None of the doctors I've seen were willing to discuss the possibility of this being COVID related as they just don't know enough to make a judgment on that. I've been taking heartburn medicine with meals (on doctor's suggestion) for a few months, but it hasn't helped. I also don't get actual heartburn, and my diet is pretty mild.

I did get tested, but by the time testing was available to me, it had already been a few months, and I tested negative (not antibody test). I assume it was COVID nonetheless due to the extremely long term throat issues I've been having, and the timing of my initial illness. None of the doctors I've seen were willing to discuss the possibility of this being COVID related as they just don't know enough to make a judgment on that. I've been taking heartburn medicine with meals (on doctor's suggestion) for a few months, but	1
Any reliable information on long term effects?	I read a single German study claiming that most of the people that survived covid, regardless if they were asymptomatic, had long term damage to things like kidneys, lungs and heart. It is the only piece of information I've read about it that claims it to be as prevalent. Other sources talk about the possibilities but claim the chances to not be as big. This kind of information really freaks me out man. I think a single study as categoric as that one might not be enough to jump to conclusions, anybody else who has this worry? Any source claiming something different?	Any reliable information on long term effects?

Anyone else experiencing these symptoms and how to speed recovery? (Tested negative)	Hey! My brother tested negative for Covid-19 virus around 2 weeks ago, but for the past 2 months, he’s been feeling horrible and he’s recently been experiencing the following symptoms: · Joint pains randomly all over his body · Blood mixed with stool · Seeing floaters · Feeling fatigued randomly throughout the day · He had a fever for 6 hours I am wondering if anyone else is experiencing these and what he could do to speed up recovery? Are all these part of post viral fatigue?	Anyone else experiencing these symptoms and how to speed recovery? (Tested negative) Hey!

Day 49- feeling better!	Just wanted to say that at 7 weeks in I’m starting to feel like a human again. I still have a low fever, but it’s not constant like it’s been for most of the time I’ve been ill. My breathing is much better- I only needed my inhaler once today. I even took a tiny walk today! This is the thing I’m most excited about because I live in Brooklyn and I was very scared to go outside. It’s almost impossible to stay a safe distance apart from people on the street and there are still people out without masks and smoking. I was even able to do some cleaning up in the kitchen just now! My temperature went up briefly but I’m ok otherwise. My biggest issue now is major fatigue. I’m sleeping tons, I guess because my body is now in repair mode instead of fight mode- at least that’s what I’m hoping. I really hope I’m getting better now. And I hope that I can give you hope if you’re still in the throes of this awful virus. It’s been a terrible 7 weeks and the scariest thing I’ve ever dealt with- and I’ve had a lot	Day 49- feeling better! Just wanted to say that at 7 weeks in I’m starting to feel like a human again.

Would it be possible for me to have gotten covid mid/late December?	I'm in Northern Italy about one hour away from one of the first epicenters and quarantined town . I remember that around the mid/end of December I got corona like symptoms. Worst cough I have ever gotten in my life that lasted about 3 weeks, slightly high fever 37.6 and costant shortness of breath. When I look back I do wonder if that could have been coronavirus, the first reports of covid were just coming out of Wuhan back then, but I did frequent Chinese bars very often. And I remember some of my friends got similar symptoms, but when I look online the first reported cases in Italy were in January and in Milan, which is about 3 hours from where I live.

What have your experiences with sore throat/cough been like?	Two weeks ago I had a pretty nasty bug and took a few days off work, negative for covid. Yesterday I had a splitting headache and mucus draining down my throat all day. Nothing bad or worrying, a couple advil and i was good to go to work. This morning i woke up with an insanely dry/sore throat and a mostly dry cough (if that makes sense lol). I thought my throat just got dried up overnight, but 12 hours later and 64+ ounces of water, it's only gotten worse. I work in a job that requires me to be around people constantly so it wouldn't be surprising to me if I contracted something. Does this sound like covid symptoms, or just another bug? I'm still gonna get tested, but should I consider taking taking time off work again if my symptoms continue? I want to keep people safe but at the same time I can't be taking time off every couple weeks unless my symptoms scream covid. Thanks!	What have your experiences with sore throat/cough been like?

Suggestion for people with ongoing symptoms - Get a full blood test and urinary exam done	I'm going to get tested for antibodies next week and going to get blood work done. I've been having waves of symptoms for about 4-5 weeks now of sore throat, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, diarrhea etc. I talked to a doctor about it and believes it could be post viral and wants me to get an antibody test done and blood work. For anyone who's having similar issues, it doesn't hurt to get full blood work done. The virus I'm sure depletes you of many resources and you may be deficient in many nutrients you don't know of. I think getting full blood work done can help clear up why you might still be having some lingering symptoms that might not have went away. A lot of people here recommend taking Vitamin D but no one suggests taking Magnesium with it as vitamin D depletes your magnesium levels pretty fast. I feel many people might be taking advice of extra vitamins but don't know what negative effects it might be having on you as well. Just my suggestion to try helping you clear things up as I know for a lot of people this is scary that symptoms aren't shaking	Suggestion for people with ongoing symptoms - Get a full blood test and urinary exam done I'm going to get tested for antibodies next week and going to get blood work done.

Retesting Negative and Reinfection	Hi all, my mom and I have both testing positive for coronavirus. I got it first, only lost my sense of smell, the senses came back around Day 12 for me. Currently I’m on day 17 and I can say I feel recovered with no new symptoms. My mom, however, just tested positive yesterday. I would say she’s about day 6-7 in. Just some fatigue, no shortness of breath, and a mild cough. She had on and off days of symptoms, but her most present symptom is tiredness. She has lots of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, so I’m hoping it doesn’t make a turn for the worst. Now that she has tested positive, I’m the one who usually helps her out because I’ve already recovered. I gave her the virus sadly, and I’m not sure if every time I am checking her temp or close to her, I’m basically starting my virus cycle all over again or have any immunity. I need to be able to work (with patients) and do my internship which is around the geriatric population. I don’t want to hurt anybody and I’m constantly scared to be a danger to others, but I accept	Retesting Negative and Reinfection Hi all, my mom and I have both testing positive for coronavirus.

It's been almost 4wks since the diagnosis and everyday I'm hacking up stuff from my lungs. I'm wondering if anyone else has gone/is going thru this too cuz it feels like forever.

If you’ve tested positive for covid19, how many days after onset of symptoms or since fever ended have your doctors told you not to be around other people?	I know they used to say you needed two negative tests if you tested positive. Given the testing shortage, I can’t imagine they are wasting that many tests on people. What are your doctors telling you in terms of quarantining yourself from other people? Does symptom free mean that even a lingering cough is completely gone too? I am on day 9 since my fever broke and day 13 since my symptoms started. I still have some symptoms like cough and chest pain but feeling 10x better compared to all the other symptoms I had last week and a half. I was supposed to move in with my boyfriend the day I became symptomatic (he lives in neighboring state), so I am getting anxious to see him now that I’ve been completely alone in isolation for almost two weeks. Trying to get an idea if I still pose a threat to infecting him in 10-14 days (19-23 days since fever ended).

Allergies after COVID-19	Hey there! I had COVID very early on (January, confirmed later on with blood testing). Since then I have developed allergies and my doctors think it is because my virus and secondary infections I obtained while hospitalized have affected my immune response. I’m getting bloodwork soon, finally, but I am curious if anyone else has developed a long term issue related to immune function or otherwise after COVID. For context I was hospitalized initially for two weeks with the virus and then stabilized, then had to go back later because I developed kidney damage and ended up developing a kidney infection in the hospital. A month total in hospital and had to take medications for several months after. Kidney infection ended up being resistant to several last resort antibiotics, so the ones they gave me were very rough on my body and had many bad symptoms. Has this happened to anyone else here? I’ve been getting allergy symptoms nearby everyday or every few days since I was released from the hospital (e.g. hives, closing and itchy throat, etc.).	Allergies after COVID-19 Hey there!

Respiratory Symptoms	I’m on day 10 of symptoms, had a negative pcr test, but doctor said it’s definitely covid because of my symptoms- primarily difficulty breathing and fever. But the weird thing about my difficulty breathing is that I can breathe laying down, but when I sit up it’s like my lungs cease to exist and I can’t breathe. My oxygen has stayed high at 98.

Aches &amp; Pains Suck...3 Months Later.	Hello all, It's been a while. Still dealing with fatigue, aches and pains and headaches. The fatigue has generally improved along with the brain fog since my first post in August. I'll walk 2km one day, the next day my knees and legs kill like I just hiked mount Everest (haven't but will when I get better). The next day I'll clean for an hour and get a mild headache and have to stop. Today, my arms and elbows are sore. Why were these not initial symptoms back in April when I tested positive? I don't know. It's frustrating to have such mild symptoms only to be smacked months later for worse symptoms. As much as I am venting and frustrated, I am grateful to be able to do a short walk, make a dinner and read a book. I know some cant.	Aches &amp; Pains Suck...3 Months Later.

So did I have Covid?	So I live in Australia(Melbourne) wife is a teacher (primary). So strange set of events and I will let you all be the judge if I had Covid or not. Early March we had a friend who had a friend who came over from travelling around the world, he works for the ICC and was doing the woman’s cricket World Cup. Well we all went out for dinner one evening so we were all all together. That friend who has the friend (who by the way also got the flu and never got tested) stays with another couple of friends right, they never came out for dinner because they were leaving to go to Austria in a couple days.

Help Needed in Georgia	Posting here because this was suggested since more people read this than /r/CoronavirusGA but this a repost - and I am hoping someone here is in Georgia and could help!! My friend is giving me permission to post as this is literally their last option. Her Dad has tested positive for COVID-19. He had lung surgery 30+ years ago and now the virus is attacking his kidneys. The doctors are saying that his only fighting chance is if they can find someone who was tested positive for COVID-19 and then beat it and tested negative - who would be willing to donate blood via the Red Cross. This is because antibodies are built up to fight COVID-19. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if you know anyone who fits this description have them reach out to the Red Cross immediately.

Burping and upper left chest(near armpit) discomfort.	I had a close contact with someone who have covid19 on the 20th March. So far, i have no fever, flu, sneezing etc. . . . But ever since the beginning of April, I've been burping a lot and i have a discomfort feeling at the upper left chest near the armpit. Its not painful, nor heavy. I dont have shortness of breathe either. . . . It feels like someone is gently pressing the area constantly. Anyone else experiencing this?	Burping and upper left chest(near armpit) discomfort.

COVID positive with seemingly no respiratory symptoms.	All I had was a fever and body aches for a couple days. My back is now sore in weird places and I’m still pretty tired, but the latter might just be from the Tylenol. Never lost my smell or taste, never really had a cough besides to clear minimum phlegm (I always have a little bit of drainage off and on with my seasonal allergies). Could this have been a false positive? Or is it common to have no respiratory/sinus issues with this thing?	COVID positive with seemingly no respiratory symptoms.

Recovering from surgery and the person who has been coming over to help me just tested positive	I really don’t know what to do. My Dad just tested positive. He spent the entire day with me on Saturday (the last time I saw him) and started feeling sick on Sunday, got tested Tuesday and today Wednesday got his results. Should I presume I am positive as well? I have no cough, fever, or congestion but I am very unsure about other symptoms since my recovery has me in pain and exhausted no matter what. I can’t do much for at least another week (no lifting, bending, driving, etc) so he asked a neighbor to come give me a hand in his place, but I am so worried that I may have it as well and will spread it so I have been holding out.... but I need to be driven to a doctors appointment tomorrow. The appointment is necessary and I am at a loss of what to do. Should I just continue to have my Dad help me since we have already been in contact with each other? So he can drive me to get tested? Is there some kind of home test?

My friends girlfriend just tested positive	So i’ve been staying at my buddy’s house for the past little while relaxing, corona free. now tonight she called him telling him that she tested positive and my buddy was with her last night so i just FEEL like i got it. i’m showing no symptoms but i’m scared for my health now. I smoke on and off and i had really mild seasonal asthma. Will I be okay if i contract this??? another note is that i’m going back to my parents house tomorrow and there’s no way i’m getting any of them or my sisters sick. My plan is to isolate myself in my basement and only come upstairs when it’s dark and everyone is asleep. What other precautions can i do to limit my risk of infection to them?

MY DOG ATE MY NEIGHBORS LEFTOVERS AND THEY ALL HAVE COVID	My neighbors have this habit of throwing their leftovers over the fence to feed my cat and dog even though they’re well fed. I had been meaning to tell them but didn’t because I didn’t want to be confrontational about it since one of them is also my best friend. A few days ago my friend told me all her family has COVID. I figured they’d know it’s common sense not to toss their leftovers during this time but I was wrong. I though of telling them before it happened but I didn’t. I know that was stupid of me. Anyway, this morning I let my dog out for his morning doodie. I went outside after a few minutes and saw the bag of leftovers ripped open. I sprayed Lysol on the left overs and picked up with a plastic bag covering my hand. I bathed my dog and I took a shower afterwards. Right now he’s in quarantine in one of our restrooms. Did I do enough to ensure we don’t get COVID? Or is there still a possibility of my family contracting it from our dog?

PSA - if tests are not limited in your area, get tested	They say you have to have symptoms or know you were exposed to get tested. The thing is, the Majority of people who have it are asymptomatic, but because of these testing guidelines it seems like symptoms are common and you’d know if you had it. Well, my aunt just had a semi sore throat and was tested, and was positive. Besides 2 days of sore throat she had no other symptoms and was living her best life. Family tested positive, we told our jobs and since jobs had been exposed they all got tested and everyone is positive. There’s about 15 people in this cluster (so far, who knows what they and their families have been doing) that tested positive and are asymptomatic. And this is just the people we know, not including their families. None of us would have known otherwise and my aunt doesn’t work so people at our works got it from us who are certainly asymptomatic (me, uncle, cousin). Considering they say asymptomatic people are less likely to be contagious is ridiculous. When we didn’t know we had it we were unknowingly spreading it to our family and coworkers even though at work we wear	PSA - if tests are not limited in your area, get tested They say you have to have symptoms or know you were exposed to get tested.

(25M) 2 Months In, Short on Breath and Constantly Clearing Mucus From Throat	Hey all, Was hoping to see if anyone had input on this or was experiencing a similar journey. I had Covid about 50 days ago, pretty minor symptoms - ran a fever that floated around 100, a minor cough and a headache. Had a period of getting better for a week or two, but now I have bothersome symptoms. I feel as if I have a pretty mild, but definitely apparent, case of shortness of breath/slightly tight chested, as well as pretty consistent production of white, foamy phlegm. I’m still very much able to perform day to day activities, including working out near daily. My only wish is to not get worse. I’ve seen my physician last week, tests are all pending at this point, but definitely rattled over this. I think every other google search on my phone is am I going to die lol. Anyone experiencing something similar? Best to all.

Tested positive Sept 2, first symptom was on the first.	Hey guys, got Covid from the family, we all were tested positive around the same time. I was third in line. Last one was tested positive sept 5th. It started as just a fever and headache and then at the end of the first week it moved to sinus congestion and shortness of breath. ANYTHING I did made me feel like I had to catch up on breath, even just rolling over in bed. So now I'm on day 12 of symptoms and I still have a very tight chest, some shortness of breath and no taste or smell. Am I on the path of recovering? I haven't had fever or body aches in a week. But my mild dry cough and tight heavy chest are still here and don't seem to be getting better. My doc gave me a symbicort inhaler and recommended zinc and quercetine together. I'm just wondering if I need to get chest tests done to see if somethings wrong. And my smell and taste have been gone for over a week. Any tips? Info? Just don't know if I'm going to improve or if I need to go in again.	Tested positive Sept 2, first symptom was on the first.

This is exhausting.	I’ve been dealing with symptoms since last Thursday, presuming positive because I am unable to get safely tested. My stats are that I’m 22F and obese but otherwise with no other underlying health conditions. That being said, I’m terrified about the days to come. My shortness of breath has gotten worse today, and I‘ve been lightheaded whenever I get up from bed. I don’t have any wheezing, but I have issues breathing from my nose and I notice mouth breathing whenever I move. Along with extreme fatigue. I just got out of a nap. I’ve also had some gassiness today. Every time I try to speak, my voice is a bit hoarse. I sound like I need to clear my throat, but my throat does not clear so to speak. I did notice that I’m able to smell and taste a little bit more than days before. Other than that, I’m truly exhausted. I fear I may not be able to recover. I guess I’m looking for support and hope. I have some Body Armor next to my bed to help replace electrolytes. I still do not have a fever, which is the good part. I also cough way less	This is exhausting.

How long after you no longer have a fever are you starting to interact again with the rest of your house?	I tested positive April 4th. First symptoms March 30th. I had developed pneumonia that I’m still taking antibiotics for. I have 3 more days total. I haven’t had a fever in over 2 days. Only symptoms I have left are the sob due to the pneumonia that’s getting better and diarrhea. But that’s also can be a side effect from the antibiotic.

Long Hauler here, day 131 - Looking for advice on treatments (Steroids).	Hi all, have posted a few times here in the earlyish days of my infection. Have checked in and out with my symptoms varying heavily. My symptoms seem to worsen when I have a lack of sleep/rest. Particularly, my shortness of breath, sputum in the throat (I have found the need to clear the throat chronically), and even diarrhoea that starts up again when my symptoms worsen. Unfortunately, from what I believe is likely the neurological aspect of this disease - I am struggling to sleep VERY badly, and I immediately head into a 'relapse' after not sleeping. My G.P. prescribed me zopiclone and it has been very useful in aiding my recovery and keeping my symptoms at bay. However, recently, my G.P. has become very unhappy about prescribing me this drug due to it's addictive properties and I have now been left with nothing. I have expressed my discontent at this and have explained how essentially not sleeping is causing my health to deteriorate further. I have also discussed what can be done to treat my symptoms now, and after reading about general success with dexamethasone in treating both critical patients in medical literature, and, anecdotal evidence from people	Long Hauler here, day 131 - Looking for advice on treatments (Steroids).

Insomnia after 2 weeks?	I have developed a really nasty case of insomnia after 2 weeks of isolation and no symptoms. The weird thing is that I don't feel tired even after taking 2 benadryl (which usually knocks me out) and a dose of melatonin before bedtime. I don't have any anxiety and my heart rate is in the low 60s when I attempt to sleep. Has anyone else had this issue? I've gotten maybe 1-2 hours of quality sleep in the past 2 days.

Haven't had symptoms for 2 weeks, and still testing positive.	Hello everyone, not sure if this post is allowed, but I’m irritated honestly. I contracted covid from my family and tested positive on June 19th. I’m a 23 year old male, obese and I vape. My first week wasn’t bad, just headaches and mild fever. The week after I had high fever, was lightheaded and had more consistent headaches. After that my symptoms went away all I really had left was some left over pneumonia and shortness of breath and no sense of taste or smell. My lungs now are almost back to 100% and my sense of taste and smell are back finally. Now here’s the issue. I’ve been tested 2 other times after my first positive result. Once after my 15 day quarantine. I still had some lung congestion and not much sense of smell or taste. That result was positive. Now my brother who was also positive, after his 14 day quarantine tested negative. So I figured I still had Residual covid left in my system. I retested 10 days after the previous positive test. I just got the email for my results and I’m still positive. At this point I’m not sure wether I actually have	Haven't had symptoms for 2 weeks, and still testing positive.

Covid can suck it	Vent post warning. I’m over it, like so over it. First symptoms started 8/13. Fever started 8/15 and lasted for 10 days in the 102-103.5 range. I was weak to the point where I could barely get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I started feeling better after the fever broke and by last Friday was pretty much symptom free, I had a small lingering cough. Come Tuesday I start feeling worse and my throat got swollen and blistered. Turns out I developed a bacterial infection from my immune system being shot (I’m also autoimmune). I was given antibiotics but also cleared medically for my Covid. I’m past quarantine restrictions, and then some. The doctor said I can go back to work but to still wear a mask unless I’m in a room by myself. This is due to: Positive 8/18 Positive 8/29 Positive AGAIN today. The person I live with tested negative today but my story continues. Yes, I’m medically cleared by the doctor (and way past CDC requirements) BUT my work REFUSES to let me return until I get a negative result. My doctor said that could be a long ass time still.

Is it possible to have pneumonia without fever or cough?	I'm currently 23 days in and have had absolutely no fever or cough throughout any of those days. If I do cough, it's a single cough when I take too much of a deep breath but even then I don't always have the urge to cough. My only symptom is a tight chest since March 30 that I've been able to deal with and some SOB. Just recently I've had sort of a slight burn in the middle of my chest. Been about 3 to 4 days with this now. Hasn't been crazy pain but it's slightly there. I got a little worried and went to an urgent care and got an x-ray to clear my mind about what might be some pneumonia. X-ray was fine and was told to take some Tylenol. Could it just be the virus doing its thing and not pneumonia?	Is it possible to have pneumonia without fever or cough?

Antibody Test Opportunity	Hi everyone. I have the opportunity to get an antibody test tomorrow. Not really sure if I should do it. I would hate for them to use a test on me when I never tested for COVID, but has symptoms similar to COVID at the beginning of March (My quick care wasn’t able to test me then due to not having any tests.) Some background info: I was never tested, but I had extremely similar symptoms of COVID. All started on March 1st. Dry cough, tight chest, felt like I was breathing through a straw, no fever (highest was 99.0, my usual temp is 96.7), and my heart was racing the first few days I felt sick. I was also extremely tired. I slept for 12 hours a night two days in a row, which is extremely rare for me. Went to quick care on day 4 because I was becoming light headed from my shortness of breath. I tested negative for flu and strep. My chest X-rays came back okay, but the doc said my X-rays showed inflammation, but nothing needing to go to the hospital.

Question to those who were sick for more than a month and fully recovered	I see here many struggling with symptoms since long time, myself included. For our ease of mind, anybody that had symptoms for more than a month and recovered would be so kind to share his story?

A sparke of hope would help throumendously in those difficult times. Sorry for the typos, english is not my native language.

2nd Positive test, cant return to work.	I got sick on the 8/14 with body aches. Had about a week of fatigue. My test results came back positive on the 19th to make it official. Started feeling semi normal around the 25th. Retested on 8/31 results came back positive again. I do still have a slight cough (I do smoke weed so it’s not uncommon) and the runs. They told me wait another 2 weeks which is going to kill me financially not being able to work. Has anyone else gone through this? How long before you tested negative? Also any cases of a late onslaught or if I’m failing pretty good should I not be worried about a bad turn?	2nd Positive test, cant return to work. I got sick on the 8/14 with body aches.

Hyperthyroidism and Covid?	Hi All! I had a doctor visit yesterday where we went over all of my symptoms since I am still experiencing most of them heavily since being presumed positive with Covid weeks ago. At the beginning of this, I had a CT Scan to check for possible blood clots - everything looked good. But the doctor yesterday just brought to my attention that the CT Scan showed a larger nodule on my thyroid. Apparently this can occur due to inflammation after a viral infection and can cause the nodule to press on the thyroid so much that it causes hyperthyroidism. Symptoms are extreme fatigue, heat intolerance, tachycardia, palpitations, shortness of breath, nervousness/anxiety, mood swings, insomnia...the list is massive! Has anyone else had their thyroid checked out? Could this be a clue into the long tail symptoms? I'm hoping if so that once the inflammation goes down, then all of this will be over with?

What were your early symptoms like? Does it sound similar to what I [29F, Chicago] am experiencing?	Like the title says, I'm a 29 year old female living in the suburbs of Chicago. I was exposed to COVID-19 on June 27 at a small backyard gathering. I sat with a family friend who received positive test results on July 2nd. Four other guests that were at the party are displaying the same symptoms as me. One is confirmed positive, the other three are waiting on results (like me). I started feeling under-the-weather on Friday, July 3rd. I initially assumed it was allergies, although unseasonable for me at this time of year. A dull but persistent headache, lots of congestion that eventually turned into a runny nose, complete exhaustion. My biggest complaint is the exhaustion. I can barely function. I don't even have the cognitive energy to reply to text messages from friends checking in, or to put together a grocery list for my dad who's offered to do my shopping while I self-isolate. I also have awful brain fog. I likened it to be being stoned (even though I'm not). I'm just really confused by things that shouldn't confuse me... just yesterday I accidentally left my bathroom sink running for WHO KNOWS how long, then couldn't figure	What were your early symptoms like?

The anti-malarial herb Artemisia Annua has a potential to be the cure for Covid-19, according to first findings of German scientists studies	First I have heard of Artemisia Annua in the news report of Madagascar president claiming it to be the cure for Covid back in April. This herb is usually used for treatment of Malaria in African and Asian countries. The WHO and the scientists discouraged the use of such unproven treatment against covid since it might promote the malaria resistance. However, Madagascar president was promoting it, making tonics out of it and supplying the neighboring countries as well. Ever since I’ve read about it, I started looking into it and read that in April scientists in Germany initiated a study to see if there is any effect of artemisia on Sars-Cov-2. The first findings came out a few days ago and claim that artemisia is effective: “Recent lab studies by chemists at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (Potsdam, Germany) in close collaboration with virologists at Freie Universität Berlin have shown that extract from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua, also known as Sweet Wormwood, is active against SARS-CoV-2” The study is currently being peer-reviewed.

I’m really confused	Okay, so I’m confused with what I may have. I was sick for a couple weeks in April had several of the symptoms but NO FEVER. Never got above 98.6. I’ve had a cough since January. But anyways, I felt better for a week or so after being sick in April. Now as of around 5 days ago I came down sick again. Headache, sore throat, cough was almost gone and came back, hard to sleep some nights, very fatigued, abdominal pain, severe lack of appetite, and I feel completely exhausted. But again, I haven’t had no fever. Still hasn’t gone above 98.6. I got a test yesterday but being I’ve never had a fever or last my sense or taste of smell I’m not sure if it could be something else?

2nd Infection Question	So I tested positive in March with mild symptoms (mainly anosmia). After 2 weeks of isolation I was feeling healthy again and tested negative for the virus. Recently my roommate tested positive after feeling mild symptoms (5 months later). We quarantined for another 2 weeks but this time I never developed any symptoms. I think its probably more likely that I had antibodies still that protected me from contracting the virus a 2nd time but i'm curious if there are any studies/reports out on the possibility of patients contracting a symptomatic case and recovering and then contracting a different asymptomatic case at later time?	2nd Infection Question So I tested positive in March with mild symptoms (mainly anosmia).

Breathing Difficulty: Was it hard for you to breathe through both nose AND mouth, or was one method easier for you?	Those that had breathing symptoms, did it matter to you if you tried breathing through your mouth versus your nose? Or was there no difference in how you breathed? I have occasional chest tightness w/ slight difficulty breathing normally through my nose. However; I take in much more air through my mouth (it's actually normal). No nasal drip, no cold before this—just purely weird breathing. I'm waiting 8 days for test results, so I'm curious. I'm aware that all experiences differ, but I'll admit I'm hoping that it's just sinusitis because my breathing isn't complete trash yet. Hell, I'd settle for just **regular** pneumonia. :/ Thanks, all. And I'm hoping each of you recover well.
