Seeking advice on coping with brain fog	I tested positive on October 1st after having intense headaches and confusion for a little under a week. I first thought it was migraines, with the intense headache and dizziness. I was completely shocked to test positive! Has anyone else gotten confused and dizzy, and how have you handled it? Mine is to the point that there's no way I will be able to work regularly. I even messed up the intake paperwork at the doctor's office, putting the wrong answers or misunderstanding questions. But otherwise I am not that sick, other than body aches and tiredness. What have folks been doing for the confusion?

Why so many bad cases on here?	So I found this sub yesterday and been reading about peoples experiences. Going from the info on here it seems covid19 gives you a seriously bad flu. But when I talked to my national covid19 line they said that from the current data this mostly apply to a bit older people and if you are in your 20s with no underlying health condtitions 90-95% of cases it will manifest more like a common cold. Do you think it is because people who feel like sharing their experiences is because they had it bad and people who only got the common cold verision of it didn’t even think about getting tested and it just passed them by. Or so you think the data is wrong in how it affects younger healthier people?	Why so many bad cases on here? So I found this sub yesterday and been reading about peoples experiences.

"Hearing problems in one ear, feels ""full"""	"I was tested positive a few weeks ago, and had fairly mild symptoms (headache, sore throat, chills and a low fever). Now one of my ears feels ""full"", like it's got water in it, and everything sounds muffled on that side. Is this a covid-19 thing or do I just have a clogged up ear?"

Rash one month after COVID19-like symptoms, but a negative test result.	Alright, so about a month ago I had a flu-like illness. Heavy legs, fatigue, muscle pain and tenderness, all which have not gone away, accompanied by like 5 days of SOB, 2 days of coughing, a low grade fever that I still have, and some minor chest pains that only lasted a day during the onset of symptoms. I thought whatever I was sick with maybe gave me a post-viral fatigue, hence the ongoing fatigue and muscle pain. I seemed to be getting better, because I was able to take a 15 minute walk around the neighborhood. Then I got this weird rash. It started on the back of my right knee as a bunch of little raised red bumps, hives basically. The bumps happened first, then the itching, but it was painful to scratch so I tried not to touch it. The following afternoon, I got the same type of rash on the right side of my ribcage. Then that evening, on both sides of my buttocks. They all itched at first, and then they just kind of existed, hurting occasionally and very very briefly. During this time period, my fatigue and muscle pain/weakness has worsened exponentially. It's like	Rash one month after COVID19-like symptoms, but a negative test result. Alright, so about a month ago I had a flu-like illness.

How bad is the test?	I just found out today that my job is forcing all employees to be tested. Just wondering if anyone could rate how painful the test is? I’m extremely terrified to have it done, it’s hard enough for me to get the flu test done. Thanks to anyone who shares their experience.	How bad is the test?

Is this it ?	Here are my symptoms: Shortness of breath consequently turned out to be pneumonia. I had a sharp stabbing pain in the lower part of my lungs every time I breathed. Luckily the antibiotics (azithromycin) they gave me helped my breathing. No cough Intense fatigue and muscle aches Headache for the past two weeks that won’t budge And now the latest and greatest symptom is joint pain. I’m 25 but It feels as tho I aged 40 years. I can barely bend my knees. I tested negative for covid twice within the last week. My symptoms started just after Memorial Day. Is joint pain something you guys are feeling ? It’s scarier not knowing what this is. Also my bloodwork showed some elevated liver numbers that my doctor thinks is related to whatever is going Do my symptoms line up with some of you ? Could they be false negatives? Sending out positive vibes ! Thanks guys	Is this it ? Here are my symptoms: Shortness of breath consequently turned out to be pneumonia.

Did anyone get a wicked rash/burst capillaries down your body several months down the road?	And if so, how long did it take for it to go away? It happened completely overnight - a blend of burst capillaries &amp; a full-body rash (feet up to fingertips). Like a thousand tiny pinpricks of blood across the skin. I feel like I've heard virtually nothing about this symptom and quite honestly assumed it had no relationship with the virus at first. Did anyone else have something similar?

Some advice for anxiety	I’m on day 19. Mentally, I’m spent. My symptoms now are 98% GI now. I’m now getting anxiety attacks with almost every twinge. Knowing it’s anxiety helps a lot.

Still forced to isolate after coming home from isolation	Ugh, I just need to vent. It’s been 13 days since the onset of my symptoms, and I haven’t had any symptoms the past few days. I haven’t had a fever this entire time. I _finally_ got discharged from the isolation facility I was staying at today and was so excited to go home. Isolation really took a toll on my mental health, and I was excited to finally see my family and dog again. I was excited to just see humans again. Immediately upon returning home, I was asked by my family to wear a mask around the house and isolate in my room for another 4-5 days. They want me to get another covid test and isolate until I get my results back. I’m just so tired of isolation and having people scared to be around me. Obviously, I will get the test done and isolate as they requested. I understand their concerns, and I don’t want to put them at risk, either. I’m just so fucking exhausted and stressed. I just got home and need to unpack, but I also have to turn in an essay by tonight. I have no desk to do my work on.	Still forced to isolate after coming home from isolation Ugh, I just need to vent.

Is this enough to go get tested?	Hey everyone. Hope this is OK to post. I live in CO but was in VA the last two weeks and flew in last night (before you scold me for flying, I only did so because my father has terminal cancer and he was admitted to the hospital because his organs were starting to fail, so I only flew back to say goodbye and then just to help with the aftermath) and since then I’ve been feeling pretty off. No fever, but I’ve had a sore throat on and off the last couple of days. I tend to get allergies, so I figured that was all it was especially since it was coming and going. Today, I had breakfast with a friend and didn’t eat more than a few bites before I didn’t want to eat anymore. We drove up to a mountain town and I started to feel really lightheaded and dizzy and nauseous. We were at a pretty high altitude (about 9000ft) but Denver is already at a fairly high altitude and I was only in VA for two weeks. Altitude has also never affected me much, even only slightly noticeable when hiking 14er’s. When we were walking	Is this enough to go get tested? Hey everyone. Hope this is OK to post.

Recovery exists! I’ve felt better for a week!	Like the title says, I’ve had no symptoms outside of fatigue for a week now. I was so scared I’d be a long hauler as my symptoms lasted 20 day’s. There is hope out there though. One thing that helped me was actually staying away from this sub and others like it. They gave me so much anxiety that I didn’t need while I was trying to heal.

Self-care after testing positive.	Hi everyone I tested positive last Thursday and have been sick for a week now. I looked into articles online for things I should eat/supplements I should take to speed recovery (if such a thing is possible). There are a few articles that list the same basic things one would do during a cold. Does anyone recommend anything that has helped them personally? I think the worst part is sinus pressure/stuffy nose. My chest does feel heavy when I breathe, but my sinuses are making it feel worse than it probably is. If I could just open them up I think I’d feel a lot better. I’ve tried rubbing Vick’s on my chest, rubbing peppermint oil under my nose, taking DayQuil, but nothing seems to help much.

Do these phlegmy symptoms sound like Covid?	I have pretty much chronic post nasal drip so it’s hard to tell. The last 3-4 days it’s gotten a bit worse. I can feel the phlegm in my chest. The phlegm in my throat is worse. I’m spitting out clear phlegm every now and then. No pain. No difficultly breathing. Energy levels are fine. When I lay down to sleep my stomach rumbles. I can feel it. It makes noises like if I were hungry, but I’m not hungry because I ate not too long before (no loss of appetite either by the way). I had the flu in 2018 and this feels kind of like it in terms of phlegm. I did get vaccinated for the flu about 3 months ago. Anyone have similar symptoms? Could this be Covid?

Chest/heart pains loss of appetite	17 year old M For these symptoms at my age I’m really concerned. It started in early August with just occasional wheezing, I smoked pot and have asthma so I thought that was all and put down the dope. But nearly 2 months later the wheezing has gone away but now I have almost heart attack like symptoms. I went to an urgent care and they took an x-ray of my chest and took and EKG. Both came back with nothing wrong. I got tested for COVID-19 back in mid August and came back negative. I’ve seen some similar stories on here.

Can I take melatonin to help me sleep?	I haven’t been sleeping well lately due to back pain between my shoulder blades no matter which way I’m positioned. I also feel short of breath, whether that’s due to COVID or general anxiety, I’m not sure. I’ve developed a very, very slight dry cough meaning like, three times a day at most. Again, whether this is COVID or anxiety, I can’t sleep well and was wondering if melatonin is okay to take. I know it has anti-inflammatory properties which I’ve heard to stay away from things like ibuprofen for similar reasons (obviously not a doctor).

Scheduled a re test 2 weeks from now. Been 2 weeks symptom free	What are the chances I will test positive again? Only symptom was loss senses for 12 days, no cough, pretty mild case. It’s a confusing timeline, I tested positive one week, 2 weeks later my mom was positive. By the time she tested positive, I felt recovered. She felt recovered as of 3 days ago, almost a full 2 weeks from her symptoms. My dad has no symptoms, but still has a test for next week because I doubt he doesn’t have it after living with us. I hope we all get a negative test, but what are the chances it will still be positive? Everyone is apparently “relapsing” weeks later, so I’m very scared that might happen to my mom because I just want her to get better. As for me, I need to get back to school and work eventually. If I test negative, does that mean there’s no chance of “relapsing”? Would I be able to catch it again from my dad if he is positive by next week?	Scheduled a re test 2 weeks from now.

Is it safe to take ibuprofen?	I know there was a big thing going on about ibuprofen possibly making things worse for covid patients.

I’m gonna end up damaging my liver with how much Tylenol I’ve been taking. But I don’t want it to increase my risk of relapse or increase my risk of getting seriously ill.

Negative test, feeling ill again?	5 days before June 28th, I started feeling ill. Low grade fever off and on, sore throat, fatigue, dizziness, headache with a sporadic dry cough. I talked to my doctor who told me to quarantine and get tested, which I was able to do June 28th. Took a week to get results, by which time I felt fine, and I tested negative. My chest felt a little funny now and then, a little tight, but I chalked it up to anxiety. A couple weeks later, I went back to my retail job. Today is my first day off, as I worked the 3 days prior, and I also felt fine during that. Until today. I felt fine most of the day, and then I suddenly got hit with a wave of fatigue, muscle aches, headache, slightly elevated temperature, stomach tender when pressed on, and a dull pain in the center of my chest when I take a deep breath. Maybe anxiety? Anyway, wtf. Does this sound like something to worry about? The only time I leave home is to go to work, as I have groceries delivered.

Low grade fever off and on, sore throat, fatigue, dizziness, headache with a sporadic dry cough. I talked to my doctor who told me to quarantine and get tested, which I was able to do June 28th. Took a week to get results, by which time I felt fine, and I tested negative. My chest felt a little funny now and then, a little tight, but I chalked it up to anxiety.

Loss of Smell/Taste: More than Two Weeks?	I’m on Day 16 and get faint whiffs of strong smells like coffee and toothpaste, but I still can’t taste anything or smell anything consistently.

Anyone had a chest xray post recovery?	"I first became sick with COVID on March 3 and subsequently recovered. Now, three months later - and a routine blood test that showed elevated white blood cell count (meaning I'm an infection), I opted for a chest x ray that indicated ""hazy infiltrates"". I've been prescribed z-pack 10 day - but still dealing with this. Blood O2 is fine - so no clue but wondering if the hazy stuff clears up.

I’m recovered and stuck in my sick grandparents’ house.	I’m 16, and I was almost certainly infected by my grandmother last week. She had a fever starting last monday, and I happened to catch it. I felt weak and had a cough for 2 days, followed by one horrible night of fatigue, chills, headaches, and 0 sleep. I’m almost fully recovered now, apart from my lack of taste or smell. I worried that i’m going to get it again, and worse by being around them. They’re coughing everywhere and not into their elbows. I’m washing my hands after touching everything and trying to make it a point not to be within 10 feet of them. I’m so pissed because they’re talking about Hydroqchloroquine and elderberry. The doctors that called and gave the results said they can’t do anything unless it gets worse. One has asthma and the other has diabetes, I feel like they can help them in some way. My grandmother has been lying in bed all day. I can’t do anything to help her and i’m scared. She’s wrapped herself in blankets and she’s still cold. My grandfather is still fine besides his cough.

For long-haulers with dysautonomia/POTS : do you exercise even on days when resting HR is high?	My girlfriend is on her 5th month of COVID-19 recovery and it looks like she's got some form of dysautonomia, POTS more precisely. Exercises are recommended for this, but we're wondering whether she should be exercising even when her *resting* heart rate is high. She's pretty much bedridden, so the only exercises she's able to do are just some restorative yoga and mild strength exercises.

Return to Exercise?	Quick background: I (22M) began experiencing symptoms (squeezing headache) on June 26. I'm going into the military and run 30+ miles a week, weightlifting/calisthenics 5 days/week, swimming 3 times/week so I initially chocked up my symptoms to being rundown. Symptom Progression: 6/26- Squeezing headache and annoying cough 6/27- Fever, headache, cough 6/28- Sinus symptoms start, no more fever 6/29- Congestion and Sinus symptoms 6/30-present Loss of taste and smell started, congestion has improved I avoided getting tested due to unclear stance of the military, however my gf began experiencing symptoms 6/30 and tested positive 7/3. I am presumed positive but avoided getting tested so there is no official record of it due to my career choice. I would say I'm almost back to 100% now minus the smell and taste (which seems to have improved slightly). I'm ready to return to my stringent exercise routine in preparation for an intense military selection program next month, however I've seen some scary articles about how COVID is causing strokes in otherwise young healthy people. I feel fine, but would prefer not to become a statistic. Wondering what other's experiences have been with returning to their normal exercise routine? TL;DR Presumed positive but	Return to Exercise?

Symptom Question.	Hi all, For approximately two to three weeks I have been unwell on and off. Symptoms include general fatigue and legs and/or arms feel heavy, sense of smell changing / phantosmia, aching neck and shoulders. Odd thing is these seem to come and go. Some days I feel perfectly fine with no symptoms where other days I have some or all of the above. Now I have no idea if I'm positive or not. I'm in Australia and we have very low numbers of cases with a few days now of 0 new infections. Perhaps it's my allergies, anxiety or stress getting to me. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and have tested positive? Thanks.	Symptom Question. Hi all, For approximately two to three weeks I have been unwell on and off.

Anyone else feel like they got sick a lot recently before COVID? Is getting COVID inevitable?	I’m 29F. I work in healthcare (pediatric dentist) so that puts me at high risk for respiratory infections. I usually do not get sick but this year I have been sick a lot with mild colds and more severe stuff. I had walking pneumonia in late December. That was the worst I ever felt- started as very mild symptoms dry cough fatigue. About a week in I thought I was getting better so I went out to dinner with friends. That night i just started coughing nonstop with maybe 10 minutes between coughing. I had shortness of breath. I was so close to going to an ER. It was awful!!! I finally got to the doctor after that and was told it’s probably atypical or walking pneumonia. Took steroid and an antibiotic (levoquin) and was better within days. I also had the flu at the end of January (tested positive for flu a). Tamiflu helps me recover quick.

Change in sense of smell recently. Tested positive early July but didn’t lose sense of smell at that time.	I tested positive in early July. I’ve been symptom free for all of August except for a an issue with my sense of smell. When I had major symptoms I lost my sense of taste and didn’t notice a change in smell.

38/M - Ill from 3/1 to 4/15 - back to 100% by 4.16, now feeling worse again	So both me and my doctor presume that I came down with COVID on March 1. I was back to 90% by April 1 - and oscillated between feeling 90-100% until I finally felt completely better on April 15. On May 7 the light sore throat began to return, followed by lethargy and stomach cramping, along with pretty much all the prior symptoms. As was the case originally, the stomach cramping is by far the worst symptom predicting the onset of others. It seems to be getting a bit worse again day by day, but still severity is a full notch lower than mid-March (and no pounding headache or fever thankfully). I did test negative on 3/26 - after almost a full month of symptoms. My doc still thinks it's Covid though, and that I was just no longer shedding by the time testing. Just got the antibody test today and waiting on results. It's very frustrating to see the regression. Anyone else felt completely better for 2 weeks, only to have it all come back?

How many times did you have to take a test to register positive?	Ten days ago I began to feel sick: congestion, sore throat, overheating. Eventually I got swollen lymph nodes and decided to get tested. It came back negative the same day. On day 5 of symptoms, the same day as my test, my sore throat, suspected low grade fever, and congestion completely disappeared toward the end of the day. Now I just deal with lightheadedness, lymph node tenderness, elevated heart rate/palpitations, and just plain weird but very mild body sensations - soreness/tingling/etc. None of this is extreme it’s all mild but nothing I’ve experienced before. How many times did you all who tested positive need to take a test before it came back positive? If it makes a difference: 25, male. Normal weight. Pre hypertension. No other health conditions. Have been quarantined except for running outside where I’m very cognizant of staying far away from people. (I understand false negative chances but have done some reading and believe I took my test at a time when the chances for false negatives were the least likely.)

Eventually I got swollen lymph nodes and decided to get tested. It came back negative the same day. On day 5 of symptoms, the same day as my test, my sore throat, suspected low grade fever, and congestion completely disappeared toward the end of the day. Now I just deal with lightheadedness, lymph node tenderness, elevated heart rate/palpitations, and just plain weird but very mild body sensations - soreness/tingling/etc. None of this is extreme it’s all mild but nothing I’ve experienced before. How many times did you all who tested positive need to take a test before it came back positive? If it makes a difference: 25, male. Normal weight. Pre hypertension. No other health conditions. Have been quarantined except for running outside where I’m very cognizant of staying far away from people. (I understand false negative chances but have done some reading and believe I took my test at a time when the chances for false negatives were the least likely.) Thanks in advance	0
My interesting experience with COVID-19.	So last week went back to work, right. One of my co-workers, lets call her Michelle, Michelle and me were pretty close co-workers before her pandemic and we were excited to see each other. In hindsight, probably one of the stupidest things to do in these times, we shared a bag of popcorn. Both of our hands going into the bag. We also conversatsd less than 6 feet, she wasn’t wearing he mask, I forgot if I took off my mask at any point. That was all on Tuesday. Flash forward to Friday, we find out the Michelle tested positive for COVID-19, through her mother. She was asymptomatic when I was near her as far as I know. So right after that, I went to go get tested. Friday, I had a cough and a fever of 101. Took DayQuill that night and ever since then haven’t had any noticeable symptoms. So I’m wondering, is it possible I didn’t even get COVID? Or is it possible I could be an asymptomatic carrier? My mother and girlfriend both haven’t had any symptoms either. But I just find it very odd how I literally exchanged food, and was in close proximity to	My interesting experience with COVID-19. So last week went back to work, right.

Has anyone here had skin rashes that are very warm?	One of the symptoms I'm experiencing right now except a dry cough, low grade fevers, muscle pains and shortness of breath are red skin rashes on my upper arms that are very warm. I have never encountered skin rashes during viral illness, and definitely not ones that are very warm. It basically feels like I've burned myself in the sun. I have no idea at this point if this has anything to do with covid, I've not seen it being mentioned as a symptom.	Has anyone here had skin rashes that are very warm?

I'm on day 8, here's how it's looked so far.	"Wanted to put down my symptoms so maybe other's could look out for them, or learn about it. Day 1 - Woke up with a stuffy, clogged nose and a massive headache. Day 2 - Sinuses still clogged, slight chest pain, harder to breath when using my stairs. Decided to go to the doctor. Fever of 101, was tested. Slight body ache. Day 3 - Productive cough, coughing up mucus, having to constantly clear my throat. Body aches getting worse, pressure in chest, fever wavering between 100-101. Sinus status: Screwed Day 4 - Same as Day 3, more tired, VERY tired by this point. Day 5 - Coughing is harder because it makes me run out of breath, feel like there's a brick in my chest, but still not the worst I've ever had. Would think bad cold if I didn't know. Sinuses still clogged, fever broke. Body is aching so much putting a blanket on hurts. Day 6 - Test results came back positive. Fever still broken, have to nap several times a day at this point. Sinuses starting to clear, cough becoming ""more productive"" (easier to cough up the crap in my throat). Headache but not pounding like"	"I'm on day 8, here's how it's looked so far.

Anyone got these symptoms ?	Hi everyone! So it’s been 2 weeks that I am sick, diagnosed with sinusitis, by my GP, just by checking my nostril. Overall, I have little fever, sore throat, headache and tension headache, burning sensation in my nostril while breathing, mild coughing, dizzyness and vertigo, fatigue, can’t handle hot temperature, sometimes short of breath and chest pain. It all started as allergies, even if I don’t usualy suffer from it. Had a lot of mucus. Then came the headache and the pain where the sinus are situated, plus dizzyness. Got prescripted antibiotic few days ago, but it don’t get really better. Still feel really tired. I have really bad anxiety before all of that, so I am not sure if I am just getting overwhelm by all that, or if I should get testes, because I didn’t lost my sense or smell nor taste! Any advices would be appreciated !	Anyone got these symptoms ? Hi everyone! So it’s been 2 weeks that I am sick, diagnosed with sinusitis, by my GP, just by checking my nostril.

D27 DAE have Neuro Symptoms - Tremor, Dizzy, Clumbsy	38F on day 27 of COVID-19. Excuse typos, I have a shake. Still having fevers and difficulty breathing. Throat feels swollen and thick. I am 3 days in on some scary neurological symptoms. I have an involuntary tremor. Tremor is strongest in hands, arms, shoulders, neck and head. Focusing hands to do detailed things like typing is exhausting and makes it harder to breathe. Near constant dizziness and nausea. Baseline is tolerable but episodes of strong dizziness and nausea are very scary. I cannot walk straight and when I'm holding things trying to do something with my hands I often drop things or accidentally toss them. I have been through ER twice and was never admitted to hospital. Even when I was coughing up blood and my breathing sounded like a pot of boiling water in a metal tube. These neurological symptoms are debilitating. Has anyone else had this? If so does it go away eventually? I have a tentative appointment with a neurologist in June because on Feb 24th I lost sensation and control of my bladder and all the bladder tests didn't show anything.

COVID long haul symptoms in young adults	Hi everyone. For my entire life, I have suffered from severe heath-related anxiety. That being said, I've been physically very healthy for my entire life, so it seems completely illogical, but I assure you that it makes my life much more difficult, as I tend to imagine the symptoms of the illness I am worried about at any given time, which makes everything worse. As you can probably imagine, the COVID-19 pandemic has been extremely difficult for me. I currently have a 100.2° temperature (abnormal for me), and I am kinda going bonkers. I've been exceptionally careful, going out as little as possible and wearing a mask religiously, but my university is handling everything extremely poorly, so I have been required to attend some in-person classes and work closely in groups in order to pass my engineering classes. I guess I am posting this in the hope to get some clarity from people who have experienced COVID-19. I am a 19-year-old male, O+ blood type, with no history of underlying physical illnesses. Has anybody/does anybody know of someone of my demographic who has experienced a severe case or experienced lingering symptoms as described by those over on /r/covidlonghaulers?

I'm considering quitting my job of 6 years over covid fear, am I being ridiculous?	Hey everyone. I've tried to post this question in almost every other sub and it was removed or no one responded. I really need some perspective and advice from people who've actually had covid or at least take it seriously. I won't be upset if you tell me I'm overreacting, just be honest with me. I work at a hotel in a medium sized hotel in South Carolina. I've been there 6 years and my coworkers and boss have always been so great to me and I've always considered them a second family, 2 of my coworkers there are 2 of my very tiny circle of friends. I think if I quit, I'd lose all those friendships, and I doubt I'd find a job where I love my coworkers and actually enjoy my job again. But... No one at my work wears masks, not the staff, not the guests, even though it's company policy and posted everywhere that you must have one. When I told my manager I wasn't comfortable working around anyone without a mask or helping any mask less guest, she told me that she'd remind staff to wear one around me (but not when I'm not around),	I'm considering quitting my job of 6 years over covid fear, am I being ridiculous?

Father tested weakly positive: contagious?	Yesterday my dad tested weakly positive. Strange thing is that he’s only had stomach flu symptoms (acid reflux, diarrhea, vomiting) and no fever. No respiratory symptoms. We thought he had food poisoning as he ate more than usual on Tuesday, Wednesday morning is when he started getting sick. Could this be covid instead? My other question is.. is he contagious? He tested weakly positive and I read that he’s not infectious or as infectious as a truly positive case. There aren’t that many resources that explain a weakly positive result.	Father tested weakly positive: contagious? Yesterday my dad tested weakly positive.

Residual chest symptoms?	So I tested positive for Covid-19 back in early July. I had a mild case including a sore throat, fever, lose of taste and smell, and a little bit of burning in the lungs. I am nearly two months out now and otherwise I feel completely fine and back to normal. I have regained my sense of taste and smell thankfully. I do however experience some residual chest pain and discomfort it seems like. It’s nothing that has concerned me too much but I might just go get it checked out just to be in the safe side. Has anyone else experienced residual chest discomfort well after the illness? Thanks.	Residual chest symptoms? So I tested positive for Covid-19 back in early July.

Just venting.	I worked my first double since March today and yesterday was a 12 hour day. Pre-covid I could work back to back doubles and be pretty much fine but since I've recovered I do not have any stamina. If I could have skipped work today I desperately would have. This exhaustion is debilitating and I am so scared I won't be able to get back to where I was. Fuck this virus.	Just venting.

Update	So I previously posted about how I was feeling sick,I started feeling sick around April 3rd, I was really sick for around 2 weeks and had a lingering wet cough for another month that later turned dry. Currently today I am no longer coughing, temperature is elevated but not enough to warrant a fever (37.0c-37.3c) shortness of breath has also mostly went away, never really feel short of breath only sometimes like once a week or so. Mostly all my symptoms are gone now the only thing that’s really confusing to me is my muscles have been extremely weak. When i bend or squat I can feel my muscles shaking and its all over my body my muscles are weak everywhere, I’ve been also having muscles spasms a lot which is making me believe it’s something neurological but I really don’t know. Background- I’m 19F, normal body weight but almost underweight, and have iron deficiency and extreme anxiety. I’ve felt my anxiety get better but the muscle weakness is very much scaring me. Any thoughts on what this could be ? Anyone else having similar symptoms?

Anyone experience rapid-onset, short-duration symptoms in their course?	In the US, at the end of January I had a fever and dry cough suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks, coming on in just a few short hours. I had a high fever (up to 104/40) for 2-3 days. Then, it just sort of went away. An older family member came down with the same symptoms about a day or two behind me and had a longer course with a possible secondary bronchial infection, cleared up by antibiotics. Went to urgent care when her symptoms first started, due to age/comorbidity concerns, thinking flu. Tested negative for flu, but the docs were convinced that the cause was viral. Anyone experience a similar course? It seems awfully suspicious, but the I haven't heard many people describe a fast, short bout of symptoms.

Trouble Digesting Fats	Hi all, I'm a 29 year old Male presumed positive (no widespread testing in Scotland at the time). Been experiencing slooooowwwly lessening symptoms since February. I've had a wide range of symptoms over the past 5 months but one that has stuck with me and doesn't seem to be getting better is the trouble that eating fatty foods gives me. I can eat up to about 20g of fats a day but if I go over that I get a crushing pain in my shoulder blades and a burning, strangely depressing/depersonalising pain in my breast bone. Hard to explain the feeling really. I also get extremely loose stools almost to the point of diarrhoea and all the discomfort entailed there. I've been sticking to a very low fat diet since this all occurred which keeps those specific symptoms at bay. Not so for my random stabbing pains and (gradually over the weeks lessening in severity) headaches which still persist. My bloodwork is normal except for elevated bilirubin which would be consistent with gallbladder issues so I was sent for an ultrasound by my doctor which showed a perfectly healthy liver and gallbladder. My working theory is that Covid has done	Trouble Digesting Fats Hi all, I'm a 29 year old Male presumed positive (no widespread testing in Scotland at the time).

Long term rash... as in months?!	So we’ve suspected we as family had the virus mid-late January to February. (We live right next to a university that has an enormous chinese population and they would have just come back from Christmas break, we shared cafes and more importantly buses daily as London based). We all had different symptoms but my husband got a rash in various patches on his hands, arms legs. small white fluid filled bubbles. Most of our other symptoms went away, but his rash has continued to come and go. I know there are very few people who have positive tests that go back months but I wondered if anyone else had a reoccurring rash? Also why is it STILL popping up?	Long term rash... as in months?!

serology test negative. not sure what to think anymore.	was pretty sure I had covid for 2 months but my antibody test came back negative (lab test abott; level of antibody: 0.01). PCR test negative just last week (which should be normal after 6 weeks). Not sure what to think now; I'm getting crazy. This test is supposed to be pretty accurate (with false positive rather than false negative). Two doctors confirmed lung lesions with handeld ultrasound ; supposedely characteristic of covid at weeks 1 through 3; then lesions disappeared after antibiotics); and I had strong symptoms (headeache; confusion; medium fever; thorax pain and shortness of breath; sensation of heat in veins; joint pains). Still doesn't feel in very good shape. did a CT scan and it was fine. Now I don't know If I was infected at all. I don't believe I'm immunodefiscient. Either I wasn't infected at all (and probably have something else wrong); or I haven't develloped any antibodies (which shouldn't be possible?) or there's something wrong with the test. The idea that I actually haven't been infected with covid and could go through it at anytime now is honestly really depressing right now.	serology test negative. not sure what to think anymore. was pretty sure I had covid for 2 months but my antibody test came back negative (lab test abott; level of antibody: 0.01).

How common is a false negative?	I’m 20F and I have moderate asthma. I tested negative two days after showing symptoms. It started with a sore throat, nasal congestion, 99.5 temp and chills, then SOB. I felt great on Thursday and Friday but on Saturday night the SOB came back worse than before and the low grade fever. I had a video call doctor’s appointment and I got prescribed prednisone and doxycycline. This doesn’t follow the pattern of my usual bronchitis or colds, so is it possible I have it and got a false negative? I don’t know if I’m being overly cautious.	How common is a false negative?

I felt great on Thursday and Friday but on Saturday night the SOB came back worse than before and the low grade fever. I had a video call doctor’s appointment and I got prescribed prednisone and doxycycline. This doesn’t follow the pattern of my usual bronchitis or colds, so is it possible I have it and got a false negative? I don’t know if I’m being overly cautious.	0
Anybody who tested positive have elevated temps (ex: 99.7 range) but not full blown fever?	31/F here and I'm on day 6 of symptoms. Day 1-2 I had an elevated temp of 99.7, sore throat, diarrhea, weak, joint pain and was exhausted for a couple of days. Past few days were better, energy was back, but the sore throat is hanging around and the cough is worse now with phlegm. My temp is also starting to creep back up on day 6 around 99.5. (my normal temp is around 97'ish).	Anybody who tested positive have elevated temps (ex: 99.7 range) but not full blown fever? 31/F here and I'm on day 6 of symptoms.

Did your symptoms go away completely and then come back at any point?	I'm currently awaiting my test results, assuming I am positive. I've had a fever and awful aches but they all went away in one day then my temp was at 100, now 98.6 the next day and I've been symptom free other than the temperature. Did any of you have days where you were completely fine and then something came back another day?	Did your symptoms go away completely and then come back at any point?

Tested negative 2 weeks after my positive test?	Hello on July 7 I took a nasal swab test at a cvs drive through and my results came out positive. I’ve been quarantined and have had mild symptoms the first couple days but have been feeling pretty well this past week. On July 13 I took another test but at a state managed drive thru test center (Miami beach convention center) I just received my results and they came out to be negative. I found it quite strange to only have the virus for a couple weeks? I will be getting another test tomorrow morning at a different clinic who can test me and give me my results in 15 minutes for $80 let’s see how that goes I’m 20 years old EDIT: I do want to add that I’m still Experiencing sneezing now and then and the occasional head ache.

Did I lose my smell from COVID or from spraying too much disinfectant?	I had COVID in early March. My symptoms were shortness of breath and a prolonged cough. At the time, I didn’t know that I had COVID because there was no testing and the doctor misdiagnosed me with bronchitis. In an effort to not get COVID, even though I had it, I went crazy with disinfecting everything. And when I say I disinfected a lot, I mean A LOT. I did this for about 2-3 days. I live in a small apartment and I was even inhaling disinfectant during sleep. During the time that I had COVID and I was also disinfecting everything, I completely lost my smell for a few days. It wasn’t like having a cold where you lose some of your smell, but you can at least smell a little bit. I couldn’t smell or taste anything. I tried to see if I could smell strongly scented things, but I couldn’t even get a scent of them. I didn’t have a stuffed nose and there was no mucus. But I remember feeling like my sinuses, and everything deep in my nose, were heavily inflamed. At one point there was a burning and tingling sensation in my nose.

Those of you who have tested and have/had a sore throat at what point in being sick did it come on?	Been sick since 3 days ago went to my doctor today she said she was very positive i didn’t have the virus and I just have a stomach bug and anxiety. I have been nausea, dry heaving, shaving internally, and a bit of confusion. No fever, cough or sore throat. But I have been clearing my throat a bit more than normal. My mom says it’s because I coughed so much trying to throw up when nothing would come up that it irritated my esophagus a bit that’s why I think there’s a lump in my throat when I swallow or when I clear my throat. My doctor even said she would of never had me come in if I had the virus and she would of tested me on the spot at my appointment if my symptoms resembled it but she didn’t think I needed to be tested. So I’m just curious those of you with a sore throat how long into experiencing symptoms did you have one? Was it right away or...? Also if you would like to share your age as well.

Timeline of COVID-19 symptoms	As someone who currently has COVID-19, I thought I would create a timeline of my case personally to help people with presumed cases or those who have been exposed. **Sept. 2:** I was exposed to someone who later tested positive for COVID-19. I was 6 feet away from them, but wasn’t wearing a mask at the time. **Sept. 4:** I learn that I was exposed to COVID-19 and begin a 12 day quarantine (14 days from exposure) **Sept. 5:** I develop a mild sore throat. I pass it off as drainage. **Sept. 6:** Sore throat gets slightly worse and I develop a headache. Headache goes away with Advil and hasn’t returned at all. **Sept. 7:** I start getting chills. **Sept. 9:** I wake up without a sense of smell. **Sept. 10:** I am tested for COVID-19. **Sept. 12:** The test comes back as positive. Later that day, I start having mild chest pains and breathing issues, which subside after taking Alka-Seltzer. **Sept. 13:** This post is submitted. So far nothing has changed from previous days. I will continue to update as the symptoms progress and when I test negative (I will likely get tested on the 18th).

Has Anyone Else Experienced This?	Has anyone who has tested positive experienced a strong headache with vomiting? I experienced this the other night and had no fever. If I remember correctly, I had a slight cough. I also have no history with migraines.

I know these aren’t the standard symptoms, but I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.	Has Anyone Else Experienced This?

Unbearable taste/smell in olfactory system since having the virus?	I lost my taste and smell a few days after catching the virus. Since then I’ve had this one awful flavor that I smell and taste 24/7. It’s like a horrible, rotten, in-scented candle smell and taste. It makes most food and drink taste terrible.

TV Just Crapped Out [Venting, not serious]	Day 11 of Quarantine with me and the family, and our TV just went kaput. All things considered, we're very lucky nobody in the house is having severe symptoms, we're well-stocked with food and coloring books, and we are able to work from home (for now). The manufacturer would fix it under warranty, but they can't come until the quarantine is over, and we have no idea how long that will actually be.

I can’t smell anything but I can’t taste everything.	Hello. A few hours ago I started to feel a lack of smell for anything. I got concerned so I tried sniffing a few things. I sniffed coffee grounds, cinnamon, soda, and my strong makeup powder and was unable to smell anything. However, I’m can taste everything I eat. Is this a sign of corona?

Risk question	Hi, My coworker just texted that both his parents tested positive for covid 19. They currently live in his home to care for his child while he works. He has no symptoms. I come in contact with him daily for 30 minutes in an office. I am normally 5-6ft away, and I wear a surgical mask, but he does not since it's his office. What is my risk factor right now?

Covid-19: a very slippery slope	I've posted about my experience with Covid before, but I think I should be upfront about what it's actually done to me in the space of just 3 months: May: initial infection, lasted for 2 weeks. Considered to be a mild case, but there was a very bad period of about 6 days where I had to go to hospital. June: had a bad bout of post viral fatigue. Symptoms of the initial infection came and went on a day to day basis. July: One symptom in particular kept returning - bladder pain and urine frequency. Suspected bladder infection so recommended antibiotics. Held off as long as I could as I don't like antibiotics but in the end I thought I had no choice as it wasn't getting better so I gave in and then the next disaster happened. August: began the month free of the bladder infection but developed severe diarrhea and collapsed after few days. Admitted to hospital and after a battery of tests discovered I had contracted C diff from the antibiotic. Now I'm on an even stronger antibiotic to try to kill it off.

Tested positive, no symptoms besides mild headache	So 2 weeks ago today I tested positive. I had a mild headache and what I would call my normal allergy side effects. Today I still have no symptoms besides my normal allergy symptoms and am still triggering a positive test result.

Relentless headache and migraines. Desperate for relief. Constant headache/migraines since 7/26	I tested positive on 7/29, exposed on 7/19 showing symptoms on 7/26. I’ve been to the ER twice, once for low oxygen, and once more last Friday for the migraine and a lingering pain in my upper right lung. The ER was no help and treated me like a drug seeker. I was not there seeking narcotics, but apparently that was the doctors consensus. It was humiliating and dehumanizing. Thankfully, the head CT and chest X-ray didn’t show anything, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that I’m miserable. My respiratory symptoms are getting better. I get shortness of breath extremely easily, but cough is becoming mild. Fatigue is still moderate. The headaches and migraines are making life unbearable. They are crippling. I’ve tried all the over the counter medicines (ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, aspirin), and even tried some old Tylenol-3 I had out of desperation, they didn’t help and may have made it worse so I didn’t take it again. I’ve doused my head with peppermint oils and headache balm, and I’m not a big essential oil person. I’ve tried ice packs, epsom hot baths. I’m the poster child for hydration.

He is recovered and I am not. But now I am FREAKED out about this news of young people with mild covid-19 cases having strokes. I could not sleep at all last night because I was so worried about it. Is there anyway I can PREVENT this from happening?? I am already miserable with this chest burning and cough, now my anxiety on top of it!!	2
Covid and testicular pain?	Hello. Is there anybody out there that has tested positive for COVID-19 that is experienced testicular pain as part of your symptoms? I did a quick search on Google and Covid testicles came up in the search bar. I am currently going through some testicular pain. STD check came back negative and urinalysis was clean. Ultrasound showed epididymitis in the left testicle but rounds of anabiotic’s have had little effect. I was just curious if there is a group of people that are experiencing pain in the testicles with having Covid. This will warrant me getting a test.	Covid and testicular pain? Hello.

People with symptoms, especially ones that last for over a month- what are you eating? How much do you move around?	Im curious to see if there's a link between food, exercise, and beating this awful thing. I had some friends who got sick when I did, and they move around at their jobs but dont work out. They also eat well. They recovered fast (with some lingering crap) and I stayed very sick for months. A doctor told me I am too young and healthy to be tested (rage) but he believed I have covid, since I was negative for other stuff. I believe my sickness lasted so long because for the first week, I ignored it and pulled a few 7am- 10pm shifts at my labor intensive job. I then felt like I was going to die and stopped doing anything active at all. I got slightly better, up and down, with no end. I only started to improve two months later when I started to go on mellow scenic walks in the mountains, stopping regularly and drawing. It made my breathing somewhat worse in the short term but it also got me drinking water and spitting out flem, and the battle had been uphill since.

My Roommate might’ve brought back COVID 😭	My freaking stupid roommate went to a party a week ago, and just informed me that a few of her friends tested positive for COVID and that she’s getting tested. I’m so angry- I have been so, so careful, and have tried super hard to avoid getting sick. I’m not sure if I’m imagining it, but my stomach hasn’t been right these past few days and I’ve noticed that I’m feeling under the weather. I’m not sure if I should self-isolate or not, and I’m freaking out because I just saw my grandma for the first time in ages. I’m so upset. How likely is it that I’ve caught/spread COVID?! Is it definitely a death sentence for older people? 😩	My Roommate might’ve brought back COVID 😭 My freaking stupid roommate went to a party a week ago, and just informed me that a few of her friends tested positive for COVID and that she’s getting tested.

It's been two months since I was sick with COVID 19. Is it too risky to visit family?	On March 15, I suddenly became ill. I had fever, chills, body aches, loss of taste, headache, and a bad cough. I got tested on March 17 and my results came back positive a few days later. My symptoms fully subsided on March 24. Since then, I've returned back to work on a limited basis with limited contact with others (not a healthcare job) and I donated plasma about 3 weeks ago. I did end up giving the virus to my partner, who lives with me, and he has fully recovered as well. Over the past couple of weeks, my mom has been asking me to visit her. Obviously, I do not live with my mother. My mother and adult brother live together and to our knowledge, they have not gotten the virus but also have not gotten an antibody test. My mom has been staying home and hasn't left in over a month, but my brother has had to go to work every day and does the grocery shopping for the family. My mom is in a higher risk category by having asthma. Still, with all considered, my family is asking me to visit for a couple of days.	It's been two months since I was sick with COVID 19.

Fiancé works full time at a grocery store, and is having some worrying symptoms. Are his symptoms in line with COVID-19, in your experience? We googled it but the symptom descriptions are... vague, to say the least.	He just started a week of vacation time, and has been feeling very poorly recently. We aren’t sure if these are COVID-19 symptoms, or symptoms of pesticide poisoning (both are plausible, we recently had our apartment sprayed as well). • Persistent cough (he is a smoker as well, so we aren’t sure if it’s just a smoker’s cough) • Upset stomach • Diarrhea • Shortness of breath (again, he’s a smoker) • Nausea • Light-headedness • Cold, clammy feeling • Random cold sweats • Body aches (could be from work) • Exhaustion (could be from work) He does not have a fever, nasal congestion, a runny nose, or sore throat. He is very concerned as his job has been having him work 50 hour weeks to make up for panic-buyers clearing out shelves, so he has been exploded to hundreds of strangers daily since COVID-19 hit the east coast. He’s not sure if his exhaustion and body aches could be due to working longer hours as well.

To my fellow recovered peeps- does your cough ever come back randomly and intensely?	Its weird. It’s not like the type of lingering cough that you’ll have consistently for weeks after recovering from a sinus infection. Its like- maybe once a week, and seemingly triggered by nothing in particular, ill have a coughing fit just flare up again that will last hours because practically nothing can soothe it. Eventually I fall asleep and its just gone the next morning. Comes back 5-7 days later for a few hours and then disappears again. I’m wondering if the virus left some lingering lung damage or something? Its a dry cough, but I also feel a bit like I am drowning as if there is a large build up of fluid in my lungs. Medical background: I am not a smoker, but I do have mild asthma. Female, 25 y.o, healthy BMI.	To my fellow recovered peeps- does your cough ever come back randomly and intensely? Its weird.

This is weird, but does anyone else no longer cry when cutting onions?	Mid-illness I was chopping an onion, when halfway through I realised that not only was I not crying; my eyes weren't even slightly burning. I usually cry very easily from cutting onions. There's not really any medical reason I can think of for this, and my tearducts are working fine otherwise (I watched a sappy movie to make sure). The only explanation I can think of is that I must usually have some kind of pavlovian response to the smell of onions, and not being able to smell is why I was fine. Either that or I somehow got a defective onion. I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this?	This is weird, but does anyone else no longer cry when cutting onions?

Nervous about doctor visit	I lost 4 extended family members in NY during the peak but, miraculously, one survived after a month on a ventilator and is recovering well at home. The original infections came from a large family gathering with one super spreader who didnt know they were positive. I have a question about a non covid doctors visit. I need to go in for minor skin surgery, just a 30 minute procedure, but am nervous about going into any medical facility. I might be able to hold off but eventually it will develop into a skin infection. Has anyone here contacted covid just from a visit to the doctor?

I am a 31M. I've had symptoms for over a week, but have not been tested.	I have had symptoms for about 11 days now, and they have been highly unusual. I am 31M, in good health, non-smoker, no history of asthma nor other similar illnesses. To my recollection, I have never had a respiratory illness. I have not been around anybody who has recently travelled, and nobody I have had contact with is ill, as far as I am aware. I have never experienced anything like this before, so it's hard to believe that it could be something else. Here is my timeline: March 19: Fine most of the day, mild sore throat in the evening. I have a lot of mild allergies, so this is not so unusual for me, and I optimistically assume that's all it is. March 20: Woke up feeling fine, mild sore throat returned again in evening.

My brother presumably positive	My brother just called and told me that he has a a really bad sore throat and a pounding headache. My mother told me that he gets pharyngitis/tonsillitis relatively easily has and had had them in the past many times. Most of his symptoms correlate with his previous experience with tonsillitis however this time he has a pounding headache and night sweats. I am so scared, i just lost my cousin to corona few weeks ago and my brother testing positive would destroy my family. What if it gets bad for him like it did with my cousin what if he has to be put on the ventilator like him. We’re all in a different cities than him and living in a 3rd world country who would even take him to the hospital if something goes bad. I am freaking out i cant go through it all over again what i went through with my cousin. I am extremely scared. So helpless, just waiting for other symptoms to develop. Please god save him i cant go through this all over again.	My brother presumably positive My brother just called and told me that he has a a really bad sore throat and a pounding headache.

Chances of testing positive?	Hello everyone! I have not tested positive but I am in a sticky situation and hoping anyone could help with their experiences. Basically, me, my girlfriend and both my parents went over to my brother’s place for dinner this past Sunday (8/2).

Day 50 - No antibodies or false negative? Driving me insane	Hi all, I wish I were here with some good news of a fully healed person, but unfortunately that's not yet for me today! Still dealing with low grade fever, headaches and dizziness mostly. I just had another full blood test, and my GP thought it good to do the serology test while we were at it, since we are pretty sure it was the Covid-19 despite the nose swab test being negative (taken at day 41 of my symptoms). I just got the results back, and, surprise, both IgG and IgM are negatives! I kind of freaked out when seeing this. My first reaction was to wonder if this was all in my head? Like could I have imagined 50 days of fever, fatigue, oppression in my chest among other pleasantries? Could it just be my anxiety? I am 'lucky' in a sense that my blood test shows that my red blood cells are fairly high (nothing crazy, but definitely higher than they should be), and white blood cells are a bit low, which is a good sign of an infection and a proof that I wasn't imagining it or lying. Now, could it be something else than Covid?	Day 50 - No antibodies or false negative?

Truly mild symptoms	"On March 14, my son hung out with a friend who ended up hospitalized for Covid the following week (around March 18). We did not know this until earlier THIS week. He has since recovered. Around the third week of March, my son felt very asthmatic/had sinus symptoms/felt very tired. We wrote it off to allergies.

A few days after he experienced symptoms, I had a strange ""sinus infection."" I had a low grade fever for two or three days, a piercing sinus migraine (I get those sometimes, especially in Spring, so I didn't think it was all that weird), and some body aches. My legs, in particular, felt sore and tired. I slept a lot, though at times I felt my heart was racing. I used albuterol three or four times (asthma inhaler).

My legs, in particular, felt sore and tired. I slept a lot, though at times I felt my heart was racing. I used albuterol three or four times (asthma inhaler). I've had allergy/sinus problems since I was a kid (I'm 49) so I convinced myself, since at that point I hadn't been out of the house for a while, that I didn't have"	0
Day 5 post-exposure - symptoms experienced thus far	24, M, Healthy but asthmatic with chronic bronchitis. I was exposed to a friend who had been around someone who was positive (he didn't know at the time, she hadn't mentioned she was tested). I figured I'd have it because I was in close proximity with him for 2 days moving and chatting. It's been 5 days since we found out she was positive and I got my results back - I also just started developing symptoms. So far it's just sore throat, mild malaise, and a dry cough that is occasionally productive. I think the protectivity is from post nasal drip from allergies and not associated with virus. No soreness, severe fatigue, or otherwise. O2 stats are 99%. HR between 58-80. Went for a long walk and cooked tonight with girlfriend, but am anxious for both of us. It's mildly unsettling knowing it could go sideways on me given my history of chronic bronchitis. She has high blood pressure (family history) but is otherwise very fit and eats well. She keeps me on track haha. I'm hoping it's at worst a brief kick in the shin and then we recover.

Covid RASH	I (24 Female) tested positive for COVID about 5 days ago, but my symptoms began on June 15, almost two weeks ago. Yesterday I developed a severe rash all over my body. It is most concentrated on my legs, arms, chest, stomach, and face. It is very itchy. I took a Benadryl thinking it might be something I ate (even though I’ve hardly been eating because lack of taste) and it did nothing to the rash. In my area, it is becoming hard to have an appointment for a DR to call you via telehealth. The next appointment I could get is July 15. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else that is positive is having this sort of symptom? I don’t know if to go to an emergency room or if this is normal of the virus.

Positive and in downtown Minneapolis	I live in downtown Minneapolis. I tested positive on Tuesday and am having increasing anxiety about the riots around me. Husband has tested negative. Helicopters are over my apartment all day and night, my neighborhood is boarded up, gas stations are closed. I’ve been up every night watching the news until at least 1 am making sure they aren’t moving closer to my area with fires. I really want to leave but am not sure what my options are. I don’t want to be responsible for spreading and starting an outbreak at a nearby hotel but am not sure I can continue to stay here with reports of military police potentially moving in today and violence moving closer and closer to me each night. What are your thoughts on seeking temporary shelter with a positive diagnosis? My symptoms are mild, similar to sinus infection - congestion, post nasal drip leading to slight cough, and no sense of taste or smell.

Not sure what to do about my job	My boyfriend had headaches last week and ignored them. Friday (I was away Thursday) when I came home he told me he thought I should quarantine, as he has been getting sweaty at night as well. I started quarantining from him on Friday night. Sunday we got tested and got the results back on Tuesday- both negative. I’m still in quarantine with no symptoms (this is day 5 or so). My bf has body aches, chills, 100 fever, and dry cough and loss of appetite still. My question is: I start work again on Tuesday. Do I go in because I’ve been in quarantine for this long with a negative test result? Should I try to get another one tomorrow? My boyfriend is getting another test on Friday am but I fear it won’t be back on time for me to know the results for Tuesday.

Almost had a fire in my kitchen this morning because I couldn't smell the smoke.	"Thank god for fire alarms! I put some toast in the toaster this morning right after my fiance left for his morning walk. And because of my covid brain fog I completely forgot about it. As I'm laying in bed scrolling through Facebook I hear the fire alarm go off. So I jump up and look around me, but I dont see any smoke. My fiance and I are quarantining at a rental since we live with my immune compromised father. It's a small 2 bedroom duplex, and the way the kitchen is set up I couldn't see the toaster since its around a corner far left of the kitchen, and hidden by the fridge. I grab a chair and pull the batteries out of the alarm because it wouldn't turn off.

Anyone else just had a sore throat, chest tightness?	We are both relatively healthy individuals in our late 30’s, within normal BMI’s. On the 13th of March, my partner has a dry cough that was really bad. Then is symptom free. On the 23rd of March I get a scratchy throat, chills, stomach issues, and a chest tightness that is bad one day, then better the next. Now, my throat feels better but it almost feels like my diaphragm feels a bit tight. I really don’t have the same stamina as before. Neither of us has ever had a fever. My partner was only coughing for about a day, though now in the past few days she’s had that same scratchy throat. Anyone else have just a scratchy throat and the occasional feeling of being out of breath, without actually having any coughing spells or fever? Normally, I’d chalk this up to allergies and panic. But I rarely get allergies, and I feel my stomach rumbling all the time. Also, some pretty significant brain fog/difficulty concentrating. Neither of us have been tested.

Dizziness and confusion. Any tips?	My boyfriend and I were likely infected in January/Feb. We noticed a lot of confusion, sensitivity to light, and dizziness, among other things. We recovered, but we’re now having another wave of confusion and headaches, with neck pain and soreness. Has anyone else noticed this? Do you have any tips on how to combat this (avoiding regular pain relievers because we’ve heard that makes things worse). Thanks	Dizziness and confusion. Any tips?

Experiencing Joint Pain, What should I do?	So about 9 days ago, I was potentially exposed to someone with COVID-19 (they experienced a fever and are still awaiting test results.) I have been self-isolating for the past 9 days but yesterday I have begun to expierence joint pain. Also had a stomach ache but this seems to have passed for the most part. I just got tested and am expecting results in about 10 days. However in the meantime I was wondering what I should do. Should I take anything? Should I be doing stretches? For background I am a 22 y/o relatively healthy male.	Experiencing Joint Pain, What should I do?

When Your Oxygen Levels Drop, Do You Feel Any Different?	I am having a video appointment with my cardiologist soon, and I want to tell him about what I call some form of silent hypoxia that I might have. But before I start diagnosing myself and losing his respect, I want to know if I really have something different than the average longhauler. I feel exactly the same whether my levels are at 99 or 80. I don't feel out of breath or dizzy. I don't wake up at night gasping. I sleep right through the drops. I would never know it was happening without a pulse oximeter. What about for you?	When Your Oxygen Levels Drop, Do You Feel Any Different?

The reason I went to work is because it was before it was getting serious here in the UK before all the self isolation if you had a cough and fever. Thurs 27 feb Slight sore throat, and slight dry cough that was right down my throat, felt a bit hot Friday 28th Went to work. Sore throat worse, cough the same.

I fear from my family	I come from a country that haven’t had a big impact yet, just 3 associated deaths for now. The thing is the government hasn’t prepared for the inevitable outcome. People are out in the streets like it’s nothing, and for what I have heard, things will get way worse because of this. Last monday was a national celebration, so free day for everyone. And people decided to take advantage and travel. Alot. So take that and that symptoms may appear up to 14 days after infection, I fear alot that at that time we shall see what the people’s ignorance has done. The WHO has declared phase 2 on our country, but the government keeps messing up and doesn’t accept it! Stories are around that health authorities barely check up on possible cases, people say they don’t even interrogate people that came in contact with the possible cases! Everything is handled so badly that it’s almost certain things will get out of hand, all because of how ignorant the government is. I fear alot for me and my family. My mother’s job won’t be quarintined, so she’ll still may be exposed to other people, so does my father. I don’t	I fear from my family I come from a country that haven’t had a big impact yet, just 3 associated deaths for now. The thing is the government hasn’t prepared for the inevitable outcome.

Hi! A bit scared. Hoping this sub will help.	I’m 31yo male, non smoker. Only take Wellbutrin, and recently vitamins. My question is whether or not you think I will have a severe case. I have extreme anxiety and the anxiety is making it hard for me to get through the day + the symptoms. Exposed: Sunday (most likely) Wednesday: went on a short hike, was extremely tired. Not hungry at night Thursday: generally okay. Friday: woke up and able to “feel” my lungs. Just like slight congestion. Tired, lethargic. Saturday: was okay in the morning then symptoms got worse. Very tired, very lethargic. Starting noon I stopped eating. Went to go get tested. Who knows when that will come back. Had diarrhea the first time. Temp floating around 99, peaks at 99.7. Sunday: worst day thus far, horrible stomach pain, diarrhea, still not eating. Like nothing. Very tired, in bed all day. Can still walk and talk but just want to be in bed. Temp around 99. Monday: not much different than Sunday. Tired, not eating, didn’t do much of anything. Still a bit of pressure behind sternum, like very slight. Tuesday: felt better enough in the morning to do some work on my computer. Could eat again,	Hi! A bit scared. Hoping this sub will help. I’m 31yo male, non smoker.

Mom is positive	My husband and I live with my mother, who just tested positive. We are in the basement and have limited being near her as soon as she told us her coworker wasn't feeling well after he partied in Wisconsin. We are in the process of setting up an appointment to both get tested to be safe. I'm just wondering the likelihood of us contracting it. Her symptoms were a fever of 100.6 for one night, sweats while trying to do dishes, and now she lost her sense of taste. So far 3 coworkers of hers are positive, and her boss wasn't feeling well and still knowingly did not wear a mask OR tell them she was feeling sick. We both are in fairly good health, however I don't have health insurance. Just wanting to know if anyone has had a similar experience...I'm scared more than anything.

Wondering how long you had symptoms for?	I've felt kind of blah on and off for the past month or so (I am also a very anxious person and attributed to that). Last night was different though, I went to bed at 6. Slept till about 8 this morning. Have a cough and low grade temp. Spoke with my doctor who suggested I get tested. I just got back from testing (I should know in 3-5 days) and I have a question: is it possible I had it this whole time? When does the clock start and stop? I know there isn't any definitive answer, just wondering if I do have it if I'm near the end of it or just the beginning.	Wondering how long you had symptoms for?

Rash on palmar-plantar side hands and feet	Hi, I (22F) and healthy have experienced several bumps on the palms of my hands and soles of my feet : red (almost like mosquito bites) and slightly itchy. They disappeared within 2 days. Several studies from Italy and Spain show that people who have experienced rashes after or while being infected with covid19. I have already seen a doctor and he has excluded bed bugs, allergies, hand mouth foot disease, STIs, inflammation (c reactive protein) and dermatological conditions. Ive decided to do a covid test and I am currently waiting for the results. The results might appear negative if I was infected several weeks ago. I could’ve been exposed to people who tested positive since I work with the public. Anyone has experienced rashes on their palms or feet? I also had a headache and chills, but no respiratory symptoms or fever. Please share as this could help.

On what day did you test? Did you have symptoms?	So I just got swabbed, but I’m over a week out, and I haven’t had a fever for a week now, and I’m wondering if it will still show up positive if it’s been like 10+ days since onset of symptoms. Would suck to get a negative and think I didn’t have it when I did. I only have a dry cough now, but that can go on for a while even after you’re well. Does anyone know how long covid remains positive in the body?	On what day did you test? Did you have symptoms?

Bananas	Was positive back in mid June, lost taste/smell. Smell is still gone and taste is limited. At first I thought my taste was coming back, but I think it’s been like this since the beginning and more so that I’m becoming more accustomed to what I can taste. I’ve been using bananas as a sort of benchmark to gauge if there’s been any improvement, they still taste so strange to me unlike some other things. They say 2-4 weeks is when taste typically comes back, but I’m curious if it does actually ever “come back” OR if it takes 2-4 weeks for our brains to get used to it and say, “oh well this is what taste is now.

Has anyone ever been deemed “low risk” and still tested positive?	My dad came into contact with someone who had COVID-19. Apparently the man had looked really bad according to my dad so my dad stood back a fair bit (2-3 feet) and talked to this man for less than 2 minutes and then the man took off, but he was there to service the man’s forklift and touch everything the man touched (but he air blasted all the dust and everything out of it first) He then got a call from the health unit, he told them the entire story and they said he was “translucent” or some word like that and that he was very very low risk since he didn’t talk to the man for more than 15 minutes or was around him that long. Has anyone else been told they were low risk and then turned out positive? I know it happens we are just scared my dad will be positive because he has a heart condition.

At what point is it serious? Timeline	So I’m starting to panic as one of my symptoms is getting worse. I was tested as positive on Friday although started on Thursday with a scratchy throat, slept for about 20hours straight on day 2 Day 1: throat starts to scrape but very mild but I know something is coming on Day 2: headache, tired, sweating, small cough, mild sore throat, struggling to eat Day 3: tired, small cough, worsening sore throat unable to eat without serious discomfort Day 4: tired, small cough, really bad sore throat unable to eat Day 5: tired because not sleeping properly due to sore throat, doctor prescribed over the phone co-codamol 15/500 to help alleviate pain so I can eat - barely slept and throats still feeling as bad as it has been with no improvement Day 6(now): painkillers don’t feel like they are doing much, sore throat is still as bad as ever - sore and I’m really struggling to eat. In this whole time I’ve have like 4 slices of bread a tin of soup, some beans and a few waffles, a bit of rice and meat but all tiny portions as the pain gets to much.

Depression and nonchalance in a COVID-19 person. Is it normal?	It seems like I have no energy to do anything anymore. Like, no motivation or drive. I go to my online meetings for my awesome dream job, I do my work for class (college student), but other than that I’m just hella tired and depressed. I no longer wanna do fun stuff. I don’t wanna watch TV or such. I just wanna sit in bed and cry for some reason. I just am burnt out. I have a class project to finish but I’m too tired to do anything. I’m waiting for the hospital to call me back for my swab and antibody test appointment tomorrow. My partner was trying to talk nicely to me and be cutesy and affectionate (verbally) and I was having none of it. I was so burnt out and tired I don’t want to feel anything anymore. Sometimes I just wanna spend the entire day asleep. I have diagnosed depression and I’m on Lexapro + therapy (have been for one year) and my progress was immense. I’m just tired. Very very very tired. And emotionally drained. Does any other COVID-19 positive person feel this way, like they’re emotionally burnt out and depressed/sad/emotionless?

A little good news...	My 17 year old tested negative 3 weeks and 3 weeks 1 day from her first symptom.(2 tests) Still has muted smell and taste. Her symptoms while sick were breathing issues, fatigue, headaches,dizziness, GI issues, fever, chest pain, all of which have subsided except occasional headache if she doesn’t hydrate enough.

Oil Pulling for COVID-19	I've been recently doing some oil pulling with coconut oil in order to heal a cavity and the thought occurred to me: could this help with COVID-19? Here's my reasoning: I remember reading somewhere that the virus tends to start in people's mouth and throat because of the high number of ACE2 receptors there, and I know that the virus is characterized by a lipid envelope, so wouldn't an oil such as coconut oil interact with the virus and possible disable it? Could oil pulling bind to the virus and sweep it out of the mouth, thereby slowing the virus' replication rate and giving the immune system a fighting chance? I also read that they have recently started a clinical trial in the Philippines using coconut oil for COVID-19, so maybe my theory isn't all that crazy.

Weird symptoms	So I’m on what I believe is day 9. My tongue is burning. Anyone else get burning tongue? Today is also the first day I got a temp, although it was low at 99.4. It’s weird because I can’t tell if I’m causing some of my symptoms with my anxiety. I get SOB but more like breathless. If I breathe I breathe fine my oxygen stays around 98. I also haven’t slept in 2 days. Whenever I try to sleep and doze I immediately wake up. I’m an emotional rollercoaster. I get random pains in my back. Yesterday I had a fizzing sensation like someone put Alka-Seltzer in my torso. I was presumed positive March 10th and had more symptoms then. My whole family got sick then as well. Now here I am and I’m the only sick one. Maybe this is post viral and I’m just testing positive? Either way I keep reading about people dying alone in hospitals and I just sit up and cry for hours. Sorry I’m all over the place. I also have never lost smell or taste is that weird? Going crazy	Weird symptoms So I’m on what I believe is day 9. My tongue is burning. Anyone else get burning tongue?

I was confirmed positive back in early March, it’s been months without the virus for me but there’s been some lingering strange symptoms I have.

What was day 9-12 like for everyone?	I’m on day 9 today, and the last 4 days I’ve honestly felt pretty great, but today I’ve started getting shortness of breath and a bit of a tickle in my chest.

Looking For Similar Experiences	I'm at 31 (m) who had GI issues for about a solid week before developing a sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath with chest tightness. I had all issues together for about five days with no fever or cough before it all kinda just went away. I was wondering if anybody had a similar experience.

Update from breathing issues guy.	Thought I was sort of getting better, maybe 5 to 10 percent. Had one of my bad nights last night, went to e r this morning. Looked at heart with ekg and said it looked out which is good, drew blood and took X-ray of heart or lungs not sure. Seemed to think I looked out, nobody heard of citakin storm. Day 13 so far. This virus is truly insane. If I live, I have no idea how long this will take, or how or when to go get treatment. I was sure I was having a heart attack, turned out I was ok. Hospital staff was cool but not sure if they would want me to come again. Blah. Still a bit worried about other organs including kidneys, but heart is weak organ so glad that is doing ok so far.

Stabbing Pains?	Is anyone else experiencing really sharp stabbing pains? I got tested on Tuesday and don’t have results yet. I’ve had low fevers for the past week accompanied by headaches and body aches. Up until recently, the body aches felt more like muscle soreness. Now, I’ve started having awful stabbing pains in my upper body. I just spent 6 hours in the ER with stabbing chest, neck, arm and upper back pains just to be told that my heart and lungs look fine and that this is probably just another COVID thing. Anyone else have this?? I feel like everyone thought I was insane and making things up. But my pain is extremely real and it’s driving me insane.	Stabbing Pains?

Should I be concerned if it’s at 97% but I am struggling and feeling like I’m not getting enough air? I’m not sure if it’s an accurate indicator of how much oxygen I’m able to breathe in at any given time, or if it’s only measuring steady oxygen levels in my blood.

Father Intubated Since Thursday March 26	Excuse formatting as I am on mobile... my father was intubated as of Thursday March 26. During the intubation process, his kidneys stopped receiving blood flow and he suffered renal failure. The doctors have been lowering his vent settings, and his oxygen levels in his blood have been increasing which means his body has been able to do more on its own which is a good thing. As of right now, he is undergoing dialysis and the main focus is to get his kidneys back online. Because of the renal failure, his blood pressure has been dropping dangerously low without a constant supply of dopamine. We are on day 4 of this now and just praying for signs of improvement. The hardest thing has been not being able to visit. Not being able to hold his hand as he goes through this. I write and drop off letters at the hospital for the nursing staff to read him, so that he knows he is not alone. I know he can hear those letters even in his sedated state. All we can do is pray now, just pray that we may see him again.	Father Intubated Since Thursday March 26 Excuse formatting as I am on mobile... my father was intubated as of Thursday March 26.

Nothing major and he was perfectly fine still working (WFH) 8/10-today: symptoms have pretty much disappeared, smell returned Me: I came in contact with him on 8/3 8/7: got tested, PCR test negative 8/9-8/10: minor sore throat 8/10: took another PCR test came back positive 8/11: sore throat worsens, a little tired, congestion 8/12: today I woke up still with a sore throat, also realized I couldn’t smell So my boyfriends pretty much recovered, while mine just started.

Has any long hauler been treated with a therapy that assumes active infection like plasma therapy or IVIG?	I am obviously not a medical professional and therefore can't be certain, but I suspect a persistent infection in my case, having not had any linear improvement since symptoms onset in March. I have heard people like Dr Putrino of Mt Sinai Hospital claim that persistent infection is likely in some long haul cases and that plasma therapy or any therapy that assumes active infection like IVIG could be beneficial. I genuinely believe the longer this continues, the worse its going to get without any intervention. The major problem however, is that like so many others nothing in my tests indicate a problem. This is making it seemingly impossible to convince any medical professional of the persistent infection theory as they all suggest its a post viral condition that will improve over time. And even if I did get through to them, the actions they could take are also seemingly non existent. I have heard cases of long haulers being effectively treated but its very few and far between. For the most part, we all continue to document our suffering on internet platforms like these and receive little to no medical intervention.

Can someone who is positive tell me if these symptoms seem familiar	So last night i had a light cough. And it didnt feel like my usual too much mucous in throat cough. It did feel like it was coming more from the lungs. It stayed persistent but the urge to cough is still very light. And i also noticed my chest feels different. Im not sure how to properly describe it besides heavy and tight. When i take deep breaths it does feel like my lungs are working extra hard. Also i have a dry throat despite drinking water regularly. So i have suspicion that i just have a light cough due to seasonal allergies and my anxiety is making the dry throat and chest tighten. However i want to be safe. As although im young and consider myself to be pretty healthy, i want to keep my family safe. Do these symptoms resemble what you felt during the early stages? I cant afford to rent out a hotel for 2 weeks and have no idea how to isolate myself from my family if i am in fact positive. Also how are people tested to determine whether we have the virus. Eg. Blood test, mouth swab etc.	Can someone who is positive tell me if these symptoms seem familiar So last night i had a light cough. And it didnt feel like my usual too much mucous in throat cough.

Anyone develop asthma post-COVID?	Hello. Has anyone developed asthma after having COVID? I’m wondering if I had it earlier this year at school and if me developing adult onset asthma might have been caused by a COVID infection. I had a bad cough, sore throat, and developed sudden stomach inflammation causing gerd and had shortness of breath which prompted me to go to a pulmonologist who said I had mild asthma after doing a breathing test. I haven’t seen any studies to see if anyone has developed it after having COVID so I was hoping to see if anyone else has the same experience. Thanks!	Anyone develop asthma post-COVID? Hello.

Loss of Sensation Throughout My Body	Let me preface this by saying I’m angry. It’s been over 2 weeks since I got swabbed and had my blood taken and I have yet to receive results (presumed positive). I had various symptoms over the course of a week towards the end of July. Cough, sore throat. Fever. My fever went away and with it, I lost my sense of smell and taste. Once I felt I was short of breathe, I visited the ER. There, I was told that I was perfectly healthy based on my vitals and chest x-ray, and I was sent home with no medication and told to relax as it was likely anxiety. Over the course of the last couple weeks, my sleeping patterns have worsened. I visited urgent care and again was told my vitals were fine and again I was told to relax. I have trouble going to sleep, waking up, and feeling drowsy through out the day. It’s a struggle to do simple things like grocery shopping without feeling extremely fatigued.

It’s been over 2 weeks since I got swabbed and had my blood taken and I have yet to receive results (presumed positive). I had various symptoms over the course of a week towards the end of July. Cough, sore throat. Fever. My fever went away and with it, I lost my sense of smell and taste. Once I felt I was short of breathe, I visited the ER. There, I was told that I was perfectly healthy based on my vitals and chest x-ray, and I was sent home with no medication and told to relax as it was likely anxiety.

Potentially Dumb Question: I have Covid antibodies. Would continued Covid exposure cause my body to continue producing antibodies?

Day 7 and I am terrified.	I've not had a fever or anything severe thus far. Mild congestion the first few days, today I briefly got my smell back, still feel the tickling in my throat and I can feel some pressure in my chest. It'll be day 8 soon and I am absolutely terrified my symptoms will flair up overnight from mild to severe. How do I cope? I have no insurance so that doesn't help the situation, I spread the virus to my sister and she spread it to her fiance. She's 220 lbs qualifies as obese but no other health issues. She is coughing a lot so that gives me even more anxiety. I've been trying to be optimistic and drinking a lot of water, green tea, and orange juice. I've been doing breathing exercises. I can't stop burping.	Day 7 and I am terrified. I've not had a fever or anything severe thus far.

I have bouts of hypochondria and recent exposure has me stressing out so much.	Sunday night I was at work, and me and a coworker were sitting next to each other in a booth waiting for cash. She had her mask off and on and multiple times she showed me something on her phone and I grabbed it to look, then took my mask off without washing my hands after touching her phone. She tested positive a few days ago. I have had an off and on mild fever of about 99.5 and my throat has this weird dull ache to it along with yellow mucus. I feel slightly nauseous but everything else is fine. I hope my anxiety about this doesn't make me sick when I might not be. I tested 2 and a half days after exposure, hopefully I waited long enough. Gonna try and rest and not think about it until I know. Hang in there everyone 💓	I have bouts of hypochondria and recent exposure has me stressing out so much.

If you’re antibodies are negative do a stool test!!!	Long-hauler (sick since end of March), my blood test antibodies were negative twice. Changed to a naturopathic doc and she ordered a stool test bc it all started with GI symptoms. I’m still sick, inflammation is wreaking havoc and some days now I have what feels like arthritis and an inability to walk without major fatigue. It’s been hell guys but a positive finally! Now just someone solve the inflammation!	If you’re antibodies are negative do a stool test!!! Long-hauler (sick since end of March), my blood test antibodies were negative twice.

How can I get an antibody test in California?	I'm willing to pay out of my own pocket to get a blood test or something to see if I have the COVID antibodies. I hear they're doing this in New York. If it turns out I do have antibodies, I plan to go out and deliver food to those who cannot leave the house. **Does anyone know how I can make this happen? I live in California.** My experience, if you're interested: I am on day 23 since the first symptoms and feeling 95% ok now (sore throat + headache just won't go away and temperature likes to hover at 99). I'm young (20) and never felt so sick in my life. I saw a doctor on day 4 and tested negative for flu and strep throat. The worst of it was GI symptoms and extreme fatigue. It also hurt when I took a big breath through day 15. The doctors I've called have either said COVID or unlucky enough to have a horrible cold and stomach flu at the same time. They told me to stay away from hospitals because I have nothing to gain except secondary infections from going to one. There's not enough tests in my	How can I get an antibody test in California?

When can I see my family again?	My fiancé and I tested positive in Mid June. We did what we needed to do. We stayed home. Didn’t go out. Fiancé only had about 4 days of symptoms. I had symptoms for about 12 days. We haven’t had symptoms for awhile. Fiancé is still testing positive, but his work let him come back because he’s had no symptoms for so long. I guess I just want to know, when can we see our family? When is it safe? I have a nephew that is medically fragile. He is 8, on a ventilator and a feeding tube. Grandma (64) is healthy for her age. Still active. On no medications, but her boyfriend (72) has COPD. Those are my only family members in my home state. My parents don’t live here. Aunts and uncles don’t live here. So my only close family is considered immune compromised. I’m so scared to get them sick, but I guess my question is am I ever to see my family again? It feels so hopeless at this point. I rely a lot on my mother in law emotionally, and she lives with the nephew. I guess I’m just restarting to feel really alone.	When can I see my family again?

Results came back negative, here's why that's bad...	So as the title says, my results for a lab taken June 30th (Tuesday) came back negative. Rejoice right? I find myself in a predicament now. The problem is that the full body rash that followed my fever, tachycardia, chest pain, shortness of breath, searing headache and continuous body aches / fatigue are unexplainable. That, and the 14 days work forced me to take off for being sick will go uncompensated and I am short on bills. The money will be sorted, thankfully we have a small emergency fund to pull from, but my real concern is this: I find myself with a full body rash and other ailments that I attributed to Covid and am now being told it is unrelated. Do you guys think I should get retested? My partner's results have yet to return but she is asymptomatic which I'm thankful for. Should we wait for her results? Am I forcing a square peg into a round hole? I feel like I'm losing my mind and could use some guidance now more than ever. Thank you, stay healthy everyone	Results came back negative, here's why that's bad... So as the title says, my results for a lab taken June 30th (Tuesday) came back negative. Rejoice right?

How to relieve covid related chest pain?	I had covid in early March before the shut down and was told it was just “viral bronchitis” and tested positive for antibodies in may. I developed viral myocarditis and a left bundle branch block. I had terrible chest pain for two months after having it and it eventually went away. The cardiologist told me it would be fine as long as I didn’t strain myself and eventually the pain would go away. Sometimes i get a dull ache in the left side of my chest especially after excersizing but it is not as constant. I don’t know how to treat the pain however. Would a pain killer/Tylenol help? Or marijuana/CBD? I have minor pain right now after I got carried away and got my heart rate up dancing too hard. I took my propranolol but my chest still hurts. It’s more dull and annoying than it is painful and concerning.	How to relieve covid related chest pain?

For those with prolonged recoveries (symptoms past 6-8 wks), has anyone been prescribed steroids?	My story: I'm a sports med physician with COVID. I started in early March with an on/off sore throat before I really felt ill 3/13. Over the next day developed a fever of 101 and eventually got tested and it came back positive. I started feeling better around 2 wks and got cleared from isolation. I felt good for 4-5 days and resumed taking my Flonase (a mistake?). By the time the 4th wk hit, the fatigue, sore throat, chest pressure, dry cough returned. When I feel badly it correlates to a temp in the 99s but not above 100. This week I went to the ED because I had noticeable and frequent palpitations. Thankfully the EKG and echo looked good but I definitely had PVCs. My labs were normal, COVID swab negative (the hospitals test is known to be false negative 30% of the time). The infectious disease doc is diagnosing this as post-viral and recommends steroids.

Questions for my Mom	My mom is on day 8 since she's been tested (She may have had it earlier, we're unsure.) Yesterday she was feeling better, and felt like she was starting to recover. Today she feels the worse she has so far. She says she can still breath somewhat okay but definitely has a short breath. She mentions pain around her kidneys and is consider going to the hospital because of it. We unfortunately don't have a doctor to call to ask questions. Any tips or suggestions? Thank you.

Freaking out	Hi, all- feeling very scared and freaked out/lost. My mom (68) flew in to CA from NY, where she lives by herself and only goes out (with a mask) to walk her dog. She's been a town crier for Covid since December and has been SUPER paranoid/cautious ever since. When she got here (8/5) we both went and got tested (8/7). Her test came back positive, mine negative. To add- myself and my husband have been getting tested every 2 weeks (always negative). My mom got retested today (results pending) and my husband and I are going tomorrow. She has zero symptoms and we all feel fine, but I'm definitely freaking out, especially since we have a 7.5 month old at home. I feel like an idiot for not insisting she get tested before flying here, but I can't do much about that now. Anyone here an asymptomatic positive? How long did you test positive before getting a negative?	Freaking out Hi, all- feeling very scared and freaked out/lost.

Post-Viral, Went to the ER due to a 130 resting Heart Rate	"Hello everyone, It's been around 3 weeks since I tested positive and a week since my negative retest. I've been slowly recovering, however I've noticed this weird symptom. My resting heart rate was sitting at 100-130. I went to my doctor to get a checkup but they referred me to the ER because after walking a lap in the office, my heart rate was jumping up to 160. They were concerned that I had a blood clot. However, upon arriving, I was given a Chest X-ray and had some bloodwork done. They all came back normal, and I was discharged. The ER doctor told me I was possibly ""dehydrated"". I was wondering if anyone else experienced something similar to that. I know it's not dehydration considering I drink 2L+ of gatorade each day. To this point, my resting heart rate hovers around 100-120, which is concerning. I honestly think part of it is due to anxiety, but there has to be something that links this to COVID. Please let me know if anyone else has been experiencing this elevated heart rate."

Worst BO ever!	Anyone else notice really bad body odor with this virus? I’m not talking about when you were very ill and not showering daily...but around week 5 when I was up and about I began to be appalled by my smell. I thought maybe my body was expelling the virus so I took it as a good sign and just showered a few times a day and wore lots of antiperspirant. But now at week 8 while I smell better than before, I still stink like a high school locker room. It’s sooo bad. Thank God I’m not leaving the house. Has anyone else noticed this? Or am I just disgusting?	Worst BO ever! Anyone else notice really bad body odor with this virus?

When should I go to a hospital or urgent care facility?	My symptoms began 2 days ago with only a sore throat and a little phlegm which I attributed to having the fan directly in my face the night before. Then on to yesterday day 2 I had a throbbing headache and woke up extremely sore. I hadn't done any strenuous activity so I wasnt sure where the soreness came from. All last night I had a low grade fever and the chills. This morning I woke up with the same headache and a slight fever ranging from 99.1 to 101.1. I am nauseous and just threw up a bit of soup. I scheduled a Covid drive thru test for this morning. Other than the headache and nausea I feel fine. My question to you all is should I just continue to treat my symptoms at home or go to the ER? What would be the sign to go to the ER and no longer treat my symptoms on my own? I am an asthmatic but I haven't felt any breathing issues at all. Pulse Ox states my O2 is between 96 and 99 (it fluctuates). I dont want to go to the hospital until I absolutely have to.	When should I go to a hospital or urgent care facility?

Have any obese people here caught and beat covid19 yet?	I've made some big changes recently to try and loose as much weight as possible before I inevitably catch it.

Continuation of my symptoms	"So I got results back and it said that the covid is ""undetected"" in me. Well, regardless of that, today was a good day after the last 3 pretty rough ones. Up until an hour ago, I have developed a pretty irritating itch in the back of my throat. Drinking a lot of warm honey tea to try to minimize the cough, but I am clearing my throat a lot to get out phlegm. I believe I am on day 12 of this crazy journey. Hoping the worst is behind me. My doctor said to me, as I drove to get tested, that getting the test won't change the fact that I have all the symptoms. My father, while he says he feels better, I can hear it in his voice that he's tired/gets out of breath. My mom, who works at a bank that was allowing customers come in up until about 2 weeks ago, is now coughing a lot. I live downstairs and hear her... Also, changed the flair to friends cause about 7 people have tested positive in my school district. Good thing we stayed open as long as we did to ensure it spread a bit"	"Continuation of my symptoms So I got results back and it said that the covid is ""undetected"" in me.

Am I on the mend based on your experience?	Hello! My partner tested positive for Covid a week and a half ago, and we both have been sick. I haven't gotten tested, and have just been presuming I'm positive based on the fact we live together and are both symptomatic. I'm wanting to know for people who have had it/ do have it, how much worse did it get for you if you had a mild case to begin with? For the past two weeks, I have had some shortness of breath, sore throat, fever, and horrible sinus issues, and today, I no longer have shortness of breath but still have the sinus issues and a mild fever. I'm concerned about the second wave, but have already been symptomatic for about two weeks, so mostly just, based on your experience, is it likely to get worse at this point (2 weeks in)? (Also sorry for this word jumble of a post)	Am I on the mend based on your experience? Hello! My partner tested positive for Covid a week and a half ago, and we both have been sick.

Thermometer question	For those of you experiencing daily elevated temps (99.5-100.0), what type of thermometer are you using? I've been recording these temps daily for over 2 months now using a braun ear thermometer. Sometimes I feel feverish at 99.7 and other days I don't with the same temp. My doctor advised me to get an oral thermometer and the oral one is reading 98.0-98.9. Which one do I believe?

Which foods were best for you?	I’m trying to order groceries, while caring for a very sick partner. His throat and fever are his main concerns / deterrents while eating; he still has taste and smell at the moment. He’s also has GI issues the last two days. What did you find to be most appetizing / soothing / least unpleasant? We’ve made grilled cheese and tomato soup, jello, ordered pizza, made bagel sandwiches, toast, .. and lots of popsicles. What was your go-to food, that was palatable and comforting? I’m thinking maybe mac and cheese, pb&amp;j .. I don’t know. My brain revolves around carbs. Ha. TIA.	Which foods were best for you?

My COVID Experience this far	Started with body aches late Sunday night and chills while sleeping. Started getting a fever and a headache, which progressed to a 102 fever by Monday night. Felt better Tuesday morning, but fever was still hovering around 100, but then spiked to 103 as the evening wore on. Woke up last night to pee and fainted halfway through. Finally reached out to a doctor today and was told I am presumed to have Covid. However, fever is doing much better today- in the 98 range this morning, but has now gone up to 101.5. I think it is progressively getting better, but I sure do have brain fog right now.	My COVID Experience this far Started with body aches late Sunday night and chills while sleeping.

Asymptomatic to Symptoms?	So, earlier in the week I felt like I had a really bad head cold. I was stuffy, draining at night, and my throat was hurting. I coughed at night, which I don't really remember anyway, because my fiance said I was coughing while I slept but I wasn't waking up for it. After about three days my throat wasn't hurting as much, and while I'm still stuffed up a week later, I'm not experiences other symptoms. However, my fiance is showing strong signs of symptoms. Low fever, chills, body ache, sore throat, fatigue, and gastral issues. We aren't going out at all, but I'm trying to figure out if I need to quarantine longer. Has anyone been asymptomatic and then developed more symptoms later down the road? Maybe more symptoms are just taking longer to develop? We're just trying to make the best decision on when we might be able to get essential items again and planning for that schedule with what we have.	Asymptomatic to Symptoms?

He has had lots of GI symptoms, and I have mainly had GI symptoms. I realized today I couldn't taste me oatmeal. We have a soon-to-be 2 year old.

About a month ago I decided to quit cold turkey once the virus (Covid-19) hit home. Ive felt great throughout this month enjoying the smells and tastes of my food. Ive been taking every precaution possible to avoid getting sick as though I feel as I will not survive based on my smoking history. In all honesty I feel bad that it had to come to this in order for me to stop. Recently I've noticed a lot of reports of people in my age passing away from the virus and that has lead my to have a constant worry about my situation. I have trouble finding support for my worries but it seems as though this is a good place people come for advice or testimonials from other people in similar situations.

Hypochondriac or mild symptoms? Acid reflux episodes?	Hello, it took a lot of courage for me to post this because I am a HUGE over thinker. For the past month, my heart races when I think that I could have it. I have bad anxiety thinking about my small symptoms. I do smoke marijuana, don’t usually get sick too often. I work in a physical therapy office and touch patients, but mainly touch the machines to put therapy on them. 3 weeks ago, I got major itchy rashes that would flare up on my skin. I thought I tracked it down to my new shampoo and soap, so no itching since then. Recently, I’ve had really bad acid reflux. After a meal when I lay down, I would start gagging on my own saliva and some throw up would come up. I have tightness in my chest and have to sit up for a while. The doctor prescribed me antacids, and they worked like a charm. Yesterday I woke up feeling fatigue randomly and had mucous here and there but that went away after an hour. No fever or cough, but if I do cough it’s just to get rid of the mucus when I wake up.	Hypochondriac or mild symptoms? Acid reflux episodes?

Catching CoVid-19 Brings Unimaginable Uncertainty	TL;DR Catching CoVid-19 Brings Unimaginable Uncertainty. A excruciatingly long mental hell that you should think twice about before you go out. (I strongly urge you go to the bottom of this post, glance at the statistics, and read the final four paragraphs) The other day, I was finally confirmed testing positive for CoVid-19 when I fell ill for the first two weeks of July, and I felt I should share my experience. A month ago, I irresponsibly went out to the bars thinking I wouldn't get sick right away. Just after the second weekend of going out I was in an incredibly crowded bar and not within four days I suddenly was feeling hot and fatigued. That night, I fell asleep around 10pm and proceeded to have a high fever, waking repeatedly due to fever chills, fever dreams and having an immense sense of fatigue causing me to fall back to sleep right away. These symptoms lasted for about 14 hours. Afterwards, I felt weak, my fever seemed to drop and I had a seemingly mild, dry cough and I assumed I was going to be over it within a few days. Later, I called up my brother and told	Catching CoVid-19 Brings Unimaginable Uncertainty TL;DR Catching CoVid-19 Brings Unimaginable Uncertainty.

Stomach issues?	I was definitely exposed 2 weeks ago and have been extremely diligent since. Waiting for my test results from last Friday still. I’m having a tight chest constantly but I can’t tell if that’s anxiety or not. Here’s what was weird.. 2 nights ago around 1:30 am my stomach started hurting really bad, almost like a sharp pain, and I ran to the toliet (pardon my language) and couldn’t tell if I needed to shit or throw up, or both. This went on for over an hour of running to the batheroom and sitting on the toliet and nothing happening, I was breaking out in a huge sweat, felt awful, and finally had diarrhea and almost instantly felt better. Fast forward to now I’m having like a dull ache that feels like it’s under my left rib cage, I could be completely off trying to tie this specific stomach/chest into being Covid related but I also think it’s likely, but don’t know if many people experiencing stomach symptoms, everyone I know who are testing positive are asymptomatic. Anyone felt the same?	Stomach issues? I was definitely exposed 2 weeks ago and have been extremely diligent since. Waiting for my test results from last Friday still.

Smell and taste loss	To all those who have got their smell . Did you get it all at once or it was a slow recovery . How much time it took to get to 100 percent ? Do you guys have sense for light smells and bad odours and also when you smell can you smell continously or for just a moment and then the smell just switches off ? Am really getting anxious as to when will I be 100 percent of what was before covid . Also have very diminished sense of flavours too .	Smell and taste loss To all those who have got their smell .

For those of you who have lost and/or regained your sense of taste/smell	Hi! I am currently on day 7 of symptoms, and around day 2 I completely lost all sense of taste and smell. I know this is a super common symptom but I guess I underestimated how much it actually sucks. The only think I can even remotely taste is salt. I’m just wondering how other people found motivation to eat? I haven’t been feeling hungry either which is making it even more difficult. Also if you’ve regained your sense of taste/smell, what day of your symptoms did that happen? I feel like being stuck in my house plus not being able to enjoy food is going to make me lose my mind.

What is the possibility of transmission?	I was sitting a few feet apart without a mask from someone last week who just now found out their housemate has covid. I only met with them for about 20 min, we were drinking coffee which is why we had no masks on. They haven't gotten their test results back yet and have not had any symptoms, but i'm assuming they'll test positive. I know this is a bit of a niche question, but can anyone tell me how likely it is that i'd have contracted it?	What is the possibility of transmission?

Can’t get tested but i think i have it. Did everyone have a persistent cough?	i’m 20F w no underlying health conditions. Unfortunately can’t get tested unless Ive travelled in the last 14 days or been in contact w a confirmed case. 2 days ago i started feeling some body pain and a bit feverish. Since then I’ve had a fever ranging between 99-101 degrees that usually breaks with tylenol but comes back after 4-6 hours. Last night i started having some trouble breathing (chest tightness, kind of like there were stones piled up on my chest?), and felt a little sharp pain in the chest area that would come and go. My lungs felt a little rumbly/crackly when i would breathe too. Body pain is killing me, and I find it difficult to stay awake for too long and keep passing out.

For those who’ve tested positive and had headaches	Haven’t tested myself yet but have been having headaches for a few days now. It could be because I’ve had hardly any sleep or because of stress. Anyway no other symptoms and I don’t know of or been around anyone that I know of at least that has tested positive. My headaches seem to be focused around my eyes so I maybe a sinus infection. Just concerned about having Covid but IDK if maybe I’m jumping to conclusions over here. Anyway to those who’ve experienced headaches and have tested POSITIVE for Covid, what part of your head hurt?

Mother sick with fever still waiting for test results to come back	My mother (57) came home from work this afternoon claiming to have a low grade fever of 100.5 degrees. She instantly closed herself away from the rest of our family and called to find a testing spot in our small town. Evidently when she went to our local testing location they said that she has similar symptoms but that we should have the results in the next 3-5 days to be absolutely sure. Now I’m just trying to be as helpful as possible without exposing myself (23) more than I already have. What steps if any should I take to help with her recovery? Also what can I expect if she is positive and this gets worse than a fever? And final question if she is positive and I have been around her does that mean I also am positive and will eventually get sick too or should I seek testing? Thank you to all on this subreddit. Right now is fucky for all of us and subreddits like this one make it a little easier for us to figure out just what the hell is going on.

Post Viral Fatigue Syndrome	I believe I had corona back in December, as I had similar symptoms. It is possible I had it later but was asymptotic I suppose. Either way, the last almost 4 weeks now, I’ve been experiencing the strangest fatigue I’ve ever felt in my life. DEBILITATING fatigue. It started off slowly, I felt weak and dizzy after 20+ minutes of exercise. It’s gotten progressively worse and now I can’t barely take the trash out without feeling weak, lightheaded, dizzy, and about to pass out. Went to ER. Everything came back perfectly fine and healthy. Suggested it could be anxiety/depression. I’ve had experience with these before though and this is different. Currently on a cross country roadtrip and I feel handicapped. I’m stuck to the car, can’t help with driving. Can’t hike. By the time I help set up the tent I’m WIPED out. I need to just plop my body on the ground and rest. Going up into the mountains at higher altitudes was scary. Definitely made my symptoms worse. I’ve heard this lasts roughly 4 weeks, if that’s the case I should be back to normal within the next couple of days.

33, diabetic (controlled), high BP, 43 BMI, positive, day 10	Well, I got my results about two hours ago. I’ve had mild symptoms the whole way through - mild lung irritation, no real cough to speak of, mild fever that is gone now, headaches that passed. I had a feeling something was wrong on the first day of symptoms. It wasn’t bad, but it was different. I talked to my doctor who assured me it was unlikely that I had it. I had just changed BP medications to a calcium channel blocker, and it could have been that. A few days later, I got tested. Five days since then, and it came back positive. I’m posting here for one reason. When it came to prevention, I’ve done everything right. I have worn a mask since before my state was in a state of emergency, a good one. I had stayed out of grocery stores, drug stores, etc. I have wiped down everything that has come into my home with bleach, wipes, etc. I’ve washed my hands and every surface continuously for a month.

Any positive case with these symptoms?	Hello, The past week I’ve experienced several possible COVID symptoms, and I was wondering if anyone who tested positive had some of these symptoms as well: - Constant headaches - A small red bump at the back of my pharynx, which made my throat hurt, mostly when I swallowed. This bump has disappeared yesterday. This also resulted in some dry coughs, but these happened very rarely - When I swallowed, I’d feel some weird pain going to my ear on the side where the bump in my pharynx was located. - Two lymph nodes which hurt when I touch them and are definitely bigger than before. Located under my chin - Random moments where I’d suddenly sweat a bit more/get a hot head for only a few minutes. That’s all, please let me know if there are any positive cases with these symptoms.

I haven’t been tested yet but I plan to go in the next couple days, especially depending on how my symptoms are.

Let's get really comfortable with each other: Odd poo colors?	I've had upset stomach on and off for several weeks but up until now, my poop has looked like normal poop. Today, it was very pale. Has anyone else noticed poo colors being off? &amp;#x200B; I know this can be a sign of gallbladder issues so I'm gonna keep an eye on it.

What were your first symptoms?	Hi everyone, I apologize if this question has been asked before, but what were your first symptoms? I’m currently on day 3 of self-isolating. I went for a walk and there was a point where it was super crowded and maintaining a 6ft distance from groups were not possible. I had my face covered with my shirt, but not everyone was wearing a mask. I quickly tried to pass by them, but I’m still scared I possibly got the virus. I had a pretty bad headache that seemed to intensify at night yesterday. I woke up fine this morning, spent the whole day studying on my laptop, and now my headache has returned. I took my temperature when I woke up this morning and it was 98.3. However, upon getting the headaches, my temperature came up to 99.2. It’s been fluctuating between 98.8 and 99.2 for the past hour (currently 9:30 PM). I’m really scared I got the virus, I know my only option is to wait it out, but I guess I just wanted to ask you guys what your first symptoms were. If you have any advice please let me know— I’m terrified.	What were your first symptoms? Hi everyone, I apologize if this question has been asked before, but what were your first symptoms?

Presumed Positive in March, now significant cardiac issues. Yay.	I'm presumed Positive from mid-March, prior to testing being available . Primarily gastric symptoms and fever and a fun set of COVID toes to round out my weird symptoms. Cleared up on its own after a week or two and went on my way. Until 2 days ago I ended up in the ER with AFib and some totally fucked bloodwork. Got released and saw my cardiologist today. I went from a perfectly healthy 32 year old male to being diagnosed with heart failure. Due to no prior history of heart issues, no structural issues found and other stuff I don't understand, my doc diagnosed me with viral cardiomyopathy which caused prolonged swelling and reduced efficiency which led to heart failure. On the plus side, the outlook is pretty good given all factors and I should be back to normal in a few weeks of treatment. But I figured it's worth posting both to vent and to advise everyone to get anything weird checked out. He said he's being seeing a lot of similar cases in the past 6 months and without going into AFib, I had no prior indication that something was wrong so I guess it's good I	Presumed Positive in March, now significant cardiac issues.

I don’t know what number day it is	Sick since March 4th, and again, fever from then until today and *still* counting since there’s been absolutely no improvement. Yesterday was the highest fever I’ve had in a while (101.6). My temp still stays around 100.5+, all day every day...since March 4th. I don’t know how many days it is now. Been plenty enough weeks, but I feel like counting anymore is too depressing. It’s so maddening. What end is there? What does an end to this feel like? I don’t care anymore about the fatigue and weakness. I just don’t. I want the fever to go away - that’s it. That’s all. It’s all I want. I don’t want it to be temporarily masked by Tylenol for a measly 2hrs of the day per dose. I want it gone for good. Let the fatigue and weakness stick around, I don’t care, I can scrape through the days being more tired, I’m good with that, I’ve dealt with that before, I can manage it. I can’t manage this fkn fever. And god, the nausea that comes with it. Screw that, too. Got more comprehensive blood tests done. Nothing odd found. No mono. No autoimmune stuff.

Figuring out if you're a longhauler or just making false correlations?	I had COVID back in late March/early April. I have had a few ongoing issues, like post-exertional malaise and general fatigue. These symptoms have varied in severity but I am confident that these are not normal things I experience or have experienced in the past; they are definitely 'new' to me since COVID and I am pretty confident about that correlation. However, as more and more people are speaking out about their longcovid experiences, I am finding myself overanalyzing everything I feel. For instance, I have been noticing a tingling sensation in my calves/legs and general weird feelings in my calves. I haven't been working out much due to the above-mentioned post-exertional issues so I figured my legs were just reacting to being used less (I used to be a runner and regularly worked out). I had never connected this to COVID but I read a person's story this morning on CNN who has been experiencing this and has connected it to COVID. Similarly, I haven't really had brain fogginess I don't think...but maybe I am! I guess it comes down to trying to figure out what is actually something new that I am feeling, what is real vs. momentary,	Figuring out if you're a longhauler or just making false correlations?

Just Diarrhea	Hello all, I’ve had really bad diarrhea and stomach cramps/pain for the last 4 days that haven’t improved. I don’t have a fever and my appetite is pretty much completely normal. The nausea comes and goes but I haven’t vomited yet. I was just curious if anyone else had had diarrhea and stomach pain but without a fever and with a normal appetite? It’s starting to drive me crazy because if it was a normal stomach bug it’d be gone by now and I’m seeing more and more cases of stomach issues linked to the virus. Thank you in advance and stay safe everyone.	Just Diarrhea Hello all, I’ve had really bad diarrhea and stomach cramps/pain for the last 4 days that haven’t improved.

Question about symptoms and when to be concerned	Hello, Im a 21 year old male who recently had a COVID scare. I was in bed past night when I started coughing, I though nothing of it but then I started coughing even more and still rubbed it off. Then I had a lot of pressure in my chest area and I was wheezing and losing my breath. I started to get scared and I took some deep breath to only find out that my breath was shortened. It was getting worse by the minute so I called 911, the fire department and an ambulance came. They said it was just an anxiety attack from being in the house quarantined. It seems like a sort of long shot to me, for those who’ve tested positive, have you had a similar experience. I know that symptoms include a fever and similar effects to pneumonia. But I also have heard that things like this that were left untreated developed to worst symptoms.

Anyone here believe you got Covid from a funeral? Dad just passed and not sure how high the risk is to my elderly relatives	My dad (I’m 36 and he was 69) just passed away (not from Covid) and we are trying to figure out how risky it is to have a funeral for him that’s also open to extended family. There are several people just in our immediate family who have multiple high risk factors (over 65, high blood pressure etc). I don’t want to put my only remaining parent at risk (mom is high risk). My state is allowing up to 50 people (with masks) in the funeral home at any given time for one service, but my mom is scared to even have 20 there and, quite frankly, so am I. Does anyone here who tested positive believe they caught it from attending a funeral? If so, did you wear a mask and social distance?	Anyone here believe you got Covid from a funeral?

Advice and request for hope	Hi Team Pos, I just received my test results yesterday, so here I am looking for advice and stories of hope that this too shall pass. My timeline: Last week my grandfather died, so I traveled from the East coast to the Midwest to be with family. Everyone on the East coast pretty well handles the mask thing and staying home when sick. Not the story in my hometown. Home with the family on 9/26. 9/29 came in contact with “my patient zero” for the first time. We were in my family home, unmasked. She had just traveled to and from Florida where she didn’t have a mask on for the majority of the time. She then didn’t quarantine for 2 weeks. I am very angry at her. 10/1 the funeral- “my patient zero” attended. Unmasked. I was around her between 5-15 mins total. I had my mask on, she did not. 10/2-0 began having symptoms. She Tested positive on 10/4. I tested negative on 10/3 and returned home and resumed daily life as per state guidelines. Was called about “0” on 10/4 and immediately began wearing a mask/distancing as much as possible while resuming work as per work protocol.

COVID-19 or anxiety?	Hello so starting last week around Friday I started getting a low grade fever between 99.1-100.4 (through the ear) (it would only go up to the 100s at night and it might be because I was stressed after gaming idk) and a slightly itchy throat and sometimes a stuffy nose. My chest also felt like it had pressure on it but I do know if that is because of anxiety or not. I also got tested last month because I had a fever and felt like I had pressure on my chest but the test came back negative. But the thing is my body temperature always seems to be slightly higher a week and a half before my period. It even went up to a 100 last month too when I hadn’t even gone out for over two weeks. I did go out last Tuesday just for about 45 mins to the grocery store with my father whom I live with and I had my mask on at all times. Should I get tested?? I keep telling my parents my symptoms but they seem to just brush me off and try to reassure me that it’s not COVID. I’m only	COVID-19 or anxiety?

"To Those Who Lost Smell: Did You ""Feel"" Anything?"	Hi There, If you lost your sense of smell and tested positive, did you feel anything weird in your sinuses or nasal cavity? I'm noticing a reduced sense of smell, but also some sinus pressure (though no congestion) and a bit of tooth sensitivity (not localized to a particular tooth). This is accompanied by a lot of other minor things and I'm piecing things together at the moment. I'm in a hotspot with a lot of cases around me (about 1000 reported cases in my neighborhood). I'm 35F, athletic and have been active, but noticing soreness and fatigue as well that seems out of sync with the amount of activity I've been doing and the self-care I've been practicing. Dry cough, headache, chills, but no fever. I keep telling myself it's allergies but I'm in a city where there aren't many trees and I'm indoors most of the day, so.... Anyhoo, just wondering if you noticed other rhino-symptoms, specifically. Definitely not asking for a diagnoses, just what you've experienced! Thanks in advance, and best of health and safety to all of you!	"To Those Who Lost Smell: Did You ""Feel"" Anything?

Has anyone experienced a low fever?	I experienced cold symptoms in march and didnt get tested for 6 weeks as tests were limited back then. I had minor cold symptoms like the a slight cough, loss of breath, chest congestion, etc. One weird thing is for about 3 weeks my temperature was consistenly 97 or lower and as low as 95.4. Since then it has returned to 98ish.	Has anyone experienced a low fever? I experienced cold symptoms in march and didnt get tested for 6 weeks as tests were limited back then.

My great grandma (97 y/o) has had Coronavirus for 3 weeks and is getting better!	So I just found out that my great grandma who's 97 is surviving the coronavirus. I didn't even know she tested positive because my parents didn't tell me (glad they didn't because I would've freaked out). She's still coughing and unfortunately the other person in her old people's home who tested positive has died, but she's doing a lot better. She didn't need ICU thankfully. I'm over the moon at this news because I was certain that if she got it she'd die because she's so old and frail looking.

Positive and asymptomatic	"I'm a healthcare worker and had my first routine PCR test on Wednesday, which came back as positive today. I've had no symptoms, and i'm very much hoping it stays that way! Not sure when I caught it. I'll be having a second PCR and an antibody screen on Monday. Honestly, the worst thing so far is that I've forced the people in my contact ""bubble"" into 14 day isolation regardless of whether they now test positive or negative, which I feel really bad about. It's cancelled my mum's birthday celebration, we were due to go get afternoon tea as hotels and restaurants are now open again for service where i live. But obviously quarantine takes importance over everything."	"Positive and asymptomatic I'm a healthcare worker and had my first routine PCR test on Wednesday, which came back as positive today.

Does Asymptomatic mean Immune to COVID-19 ?	As the testing pool of different nations increase, we keep seeing info that 20% to 50% of tested are Asymptomatic. I do understand that they do act as carriers but does Asymptomatic mean that individuals have inbuilt immunity and do not suffer or mildly suffer from typical COVID-19 symptoms ?

I tested positive for covid 19	My sister was feeling sick and she got tested and her test came back positive as well, so immediately after her test came back positive I ran and got tested myself. I felt no symptoms whatsoever however I got the test results yesterday- a week and a half after I took the test and was informed I’m positive. However I feel absolutely no symptoms and have yet to feel any symptoms the doctor told me that means I’m asymptomatic obviously. My Question is what does this mean for my body?

Worried there’s no end in this for me	I’m really struggling mentally today. I talk the 2-month mark for me, and all my symptoms have been consistent and ever-present, including a cough with clear thick phlegm, post-nasal drip mucus with blood, tachycardia, waking up shaking and hear pounding, no appetite, and GI problems. Nothing has changed/subsided. I know there are long-term cases, especially on here, but for the most part it seems like at this stage people are getting on/off problems, with things getting better with some setbacks. I haven’t had a fever this whole time. And it’s been so hard to eat/sleep to fight this thing. When I think I’m doing/eating the right thing, I feel worse than before the next day. I’m afraid my body hasn’t been fighting it at all and that I’m just experiencing the 10-day stage in weeks rather than days. I’m on disability leave now. It’s so disheartening.

Late Onset Vertigo/Dizziness?	Glad to find this community. 21 days now after first symptoms. First started off with a headache, body aches and four day hangover-like feeling. Then came the loss of smell and taste, which I lost for about two weeks, still slowly coming back. Never really had a fever, just a slight cough and some phlegm build up in the throat/chest. Tested positive for COVID about a week after my first symptoms appeared. Today, all I have is that slight lingering cough that is just about gone (thank goodness). But the other symptom that I have recently developed in the past day or two is this vertigo/dizziness feeling. Is it possible to start feeling additional symptoms this late in the game? And has anyone else felt this symptom? It's incredible how long this virus has been affecting me, and it's a frustrating step back when I thought I was nearly in the clear. Thank you.

Has anyone had a similar experience?	First off I want to state my father (58) was tested and it came back negative, but he is now presumed positive. His symptoms started with just a dry cough two weeks ago, which got worse and then he got tested. The test was negative but then he seemed to be getting better but two days ago he suddenly developed a fever, muscle pain, and weakness. The cough now seems more severe and he cannot talk without coughing, but he isn’t coughing constantly all day. I am concerned and not sure at which point we would need to take him to an urgent care or hospital. So far my mother (55) and I (20F) seem to be okay so far. I am concerned we all are sick and going to be severely sick in the near future. Has anyone had a family member have the same symptoms as my father, and if so how did it progress? Also if your whole family has been exposed to it, were you all very sick or were there varying levels between family members? We are taking every precaution and he is isolated but we were very likely exposed, because we thought he was	Has anyone had a similar experience?

Just got tested not really sure though	Presumed positive based on symptoms but also got tested by a giant swab (which was kinda painful) and awaiting results. Heres how its all kinda went down for me Last Thursday and Friday - eye pain. Lots of eye pain. Hurt to move my eyes and even closed they hurt. Felt tired but nothing major. Decent headache. Saturday- more fatigue. Sore throat. Started diarrhea. Sunday/Monday/Tuesday-same as all of the above. Nothing major Wednesday- woke up with shortness of breath and light cough. Other symptoms the same. No more diarrhea. As day went on cough got worse and shortness of breath got scary. Chest felt heavy and almost burning sensation Thursday- contacted dr and he wanted me tested. Went to dr and xray was clear for pneumonia. Dr says i have a respiratory tract infection. But hes highly positive that my swab for the virus will come back positive based on my symptoms and his exam. Today- still very tired. Throat is probably the worst it’s been, almost feels like strep. Shortness of breath and cough continues. Chest pain. This ones new and actually very uncomfortable. Before my chest felt like it was full/burning sensation. Still have that but now its	Just got tested not really sure though Presumed positive based on symptoms but also got tested by a giant swab (which was kinda painful) and awaiting results.

Confused as to if my symptoms line up	I know there’s been a lot of the questions so I apologize if this is basically a repost. I (23F) became nauseous Friday morning and vomited twice. I had some chills but registered a temp (axillary) of about 97.7-98.7 (Fahrenheit, that is without adding a degree). I had some muscle aches, a massive headache, and was a bit woozy. My vomiting stopped Friday afternoon but I still felt achy and tired— my temperature also remained in that range. Saturday and Sunday I decided to switch to taking my temperature orally. The highest temperature recorded was 100 (Fahrenheit). Aches continued and I was still woozy. Today I woke up feeling great and registered a temp of 98.8 (Fahrenheit, orally). I was in an airport/on an airplane on 03/07 and 03/14. I also have a coworker who has a family member with Influenza A and possible COVID-19 (they took the test for her husband but never sent it in apparently?). We wear N-95s and PAPRs at work and maintain 6+ feet between us (I work in a facility where we may be exposed to pathogens like tuberculosis and chemicals like formalin).

I’m so scared	I have been extremely careful I haven’t even been inside a building/house other than my own since the pandemic began. I wear a face mask any time I am out of my apartment. I haven’t seen friends or family I do long distance visits in the driveway. 24 F no preexisting conditions. On Tuesday we took our puppy to an outdoor puppy class. I called ahead they said everyone will be wearing a mask. When we got there everyone was EXCEPT the instructor. We tried to stay far away from her but she insisted my dog needs a different collar and got super close while we both tried to get it on. She also kept walking past us and “shushing” our dog which is basically her spitting on us. I was so uncomfortable and so mad but I figured we’re wearing masks and there’s people at Disney. Today which is 3 days later: I wake up with kinda scratchy throat. Instantly my heart drops and I’m terrified. I took vitamins, a probiotic and manuka honey. As the day goes on when I talk too much I get that tickle and need to cough. Temp is normal 97.7. No headache, no	I’m so scared I have been extremely careful I haven’t even been inside a building/house other than my own since the pandemic began.

Do you think I had COVID?	Around late March or April, I became sick. At first, my nostrils/sinuses felt weird for a couple of days. Then, things got worse one morning where I was extremely hot and tired, had muscle aches, diarrhea, and fast heart palpitations. Later that day, I started to have trouble breathing and could only breathe face up w/ my mouth. The breathing problem lasted for a couple of days, but I got better. After that, I had a sore throat for like 2 days. For the next 1-2 weeks, I had a persistent headache and fever. Originally, I thought I had a caffeine overdose bc I was drinking a lot of coffee and tea, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The only ppl I think I could've got it from would be my siblings coming from college. I told my family about this and they think it was just a cold. So, do you think I had COVID?

Antibodies in people with long-lingering cases: have you been tested? Did you test positive or negative? At how many weeks from start of symptoms?	Some people I know who seemed to have the symptoms of COVID, including symptoms appearing over several weeks, have begun getting antibody tests. At least one has tested negative. Of course, that may mean they had something else. Or, I’m wondering, maybe people who are spending 6 weeks with rotating COVID symptoms are making antibodies later? Anyone have any thoughts on that idea, or experience one way or the other?	Antibodies in people with long-lingering cases: have you been tested? Did you test positive or negative?

Tested positive, no real symptoms	Hi all, I (23F) got tested on 7/7 and confirmed on 7/10. I live with my partner (24M) who is getting tested tomorrow 7/13. We presume that we contracted it on 4th of July, so we are likely 7 days in. Neither of us have underlying conditions. Thus far, we don’t have any real symptoms (I was getting tested regularly for work, which is why we found out). My partner has coughed a bit here and there, but also coughs semi-regularly due to smoking/vape. I’ve also coughed a handful of times, but nothing that would have triggered “this might be COVID” thoughts. Today my chest is feeling slightly heavy, but can’t tell if it’s anxiety and stress, or actual covid symptom. No fevers yet. I’m curious at what point people generally started to feel symptoms? What were the first symptoms to occur?	Tested positive, no real symptoms Hi all, I (23F) got tested on 7/7 and confirmed on 7/10. I live with my partner (24M) who is getting tested tomorrow 7/13.

Caring for someone who tested positive - when to stop isolating	Hi. My girlfriend tested positive 2 weeks ago and has had symptoms for 3 weeks. I have been caring for her and we are unable to isolate from each other in our home. I developed symptoms, but I have tested negative twice. She is feeling much better and no longer has symptoms but her second test just came back (48 hr turn around time) positive. My work wants me to come back next week since I'm negative and isn't too concerned that I'm living with a positive person, saying that if she doesn't have symptoms she can't transmit the virus. For those who have been in similar situations - what would you do here? My gut is to keep isolating.	Caring for someone who tested positive - when to stop isolating Hi.

Are we trusting the CDC 10 day rule?	It seems the CDC updating their guidelines to the 10-day rules is fairly controversial among this subreddit. Most people here are quoting them, and some here are saying it’s kind of bogus and that the CDC isn’t that trustworthy in the current times, which I’d agree with. However the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control also has the same recommendation on their website saying ‘The infectious period is estimated to last for eight to 10 days in moderate cases, and up to 2 weeks on average for severe cases.’ So given the EU equivalent of the CDC is saying the same thing as the CDC, are people still skeptical of this 10-day rule?

[META] If you suffer from anxiety, reconsider this subreddit if you aren't 100% sure you have the virus.	Firstly, this sub is a great resource. But it seems to be the webMD equivalent of double checking that aching knee only to realise you've got terminal brain cancer. That itch in the back of your throat, the sore throat you woke up with or the upset tummy? It *could* be Covid-19, but it could also be a million other things. And if you suffer from anxiety, it's likely your bodies response to the stress. And if it is Covid-19, anxiety can affect your immune response negatively so it's best not to get lost down the rabbit hole if you're susceptible to that. As I said, this subreddit is a great resource for hearing people's experiences. BUT, tread carefully if you have a tendency to over-analyse and worry about your health.

Sharing space with a roommate who won't stop coughing	It's an unfortunate situation but me and my room share a place and she's been cooped in her room for 90% of the day. This isn't because shes covid-positive, but was recently in a car accident and can't walk without assistance so she usually just has like a sibling come over to cook and care for her. Well in the past week or so, shes been coughing a lot. Mainly episodes of coughing every other hour, clearing the throat and blowing her nose. We're really new roommates so I don't want to press her on it and she also has a lot going on herself with her injuries. She'll mention just her throat itches and she's feeling a little under the weather, but for the most part nothing more. We don't ever really cross paths, but we share a bathroom. AFAIK, she doesn't think she has it so she's a bit careless but I'm gonna take precautions around the house and she can't really see me anyways since she's almost bed-ridden (she'll get up to use the bathroom but it takes a lot of her and she has to use a walker).

Update - First Hike post-COVID	Update about Hiking...I was quite surprised by what happened. I was up to walking over 3miles in one hour on the treadmill in my gym with an average of a 4% incline. When it was around 3.5%, it was easy, when it jumped up to 7%, I would start huffing and puffing. So, I thought I'd be up for what is considered an easy hike in my area. If you go one way around the loop, there is a gradual incline for about 2.5 miles, then a steep decline for 1.7 miles. I decided on doing the reverse thinking that a steep incline over a shorter distance would be easier since I would be fresh and energetic. I got there about 7:40am and it was about 77F when I started. (It reached around 90F by the time I finished) The steep incline at the beginning was more difficult than I thought, way harder than the 7% incline on my treadmill. I kept stopping when my heart rate shot up over 160. The highest it went was in the 166-170 range, but I'd stop then and let it work it's way back down to about 130 before starting my climb again.

Plan was to self-isolate for 2 weeks from this date, which we did. * **8.4 -** (11 days later) Tested for COVID. Test came back positive. \[We tested because we'd been flying and therefore high-risk, not because of symptoms. After my positive, I noticed about a week's worth of mild GI symptoms, but none of the usual respiratory symptoms ever developed\]. * **8.17 -** (13 days after that) Took antibodies test. This test comes back negative. I should mention that my husband and our toddler also tested for both COVID and antibodies, and their tests were all negative. **What does this mean? Is it fair to assume that my first test was a false positive, or are there other possibilities?**	Tested Positive for COVID but Antibody test was negative. False positive?

No immune response to covid19?	Hypothetical question, if you produced no immune response to covid, what would happen?, Would it slowly do damage and take longer to get seriously ill? or Would you get sicker alot quicker?

Tested negative, test again?	A family member got diagnosed with COVID about a week ago. I was around them and took the test about 4 days ago. My mother also got positive results back after having terrible 1 day flu symptoms 5 days ago. I last saw them about 9 days ago. I tested a day after them and received a negative result. Although today I have a crazy headache that’s behind the eyes. I only feel the pain when I move my eyes around.	Tested negative, test again? A family member got diagnosed with COVID about a week ago.

Can people here post region tested?	Unfortunately with all different places using different test kits of variable sensitivity and specificity, not all positives are going to be true positives and negatives true negatives. Knowing region will be helpful. Reading through course of illness on here is helpful, but some simply do not fit. Obviously a large personal variation is likely, but cannot explain it all. Given how the CDC specificity (false positives likely) was poor, which they got around but testing multiple times which can take days. I am not expecting all other labs to be significantly better just yet.	Can people here post region tested?

How long did it take for you to get a negative?	I was positive on April 20th and tested negative on the 16th of May but positive on the 18th of May. Doctor cleared me for work after positive Antibody test but called me yesterday about the positive swab result, telling me to not go to work until a negative result comes back. I'm anxious and upset because he cleared me to go back and then took it away from me. The public health nurse said by now I'm not contagious and any positive result could be dead remnants. I read an article this morning pretty much confirming this. It was published 3 days ago. I'm gonna go for the test with the same doctor on Monday but I'm considering going to the walk in City MD and get tested there as my second test for accuracy. So my question is how long did you guys have to wait to test negative? How many swab tests? What was the City MD or your local walk in testing site procedures.? Did the doctor do it or yourself?

Thick blood	Hi to everybody. I am 99% sure I've expereinced COVID in end of june, beginning of july. I'm from Kazakhstan. I had headaches,temperature, lost my smell, you name it. After what I thought was recovery (after 2-3 weeks may be) I came to feeling constantly weak,tired and sweating a lot (especially neck) which lasted about month or even still I feel tired at times. Long story short: the latest problem I have is thick blood, I've got results on 16th of july. Ive taken aspirin for a while , but It doesnt make significant difference. 30 yrs old male. No bad habits. Is anyone in same situation? It is kind of annoying to feel 60-80% of your standard capacity, stamina all the time. Thank you people. Thick blood makes me feel really low.

Asthma has gotten much worse	Hey everyone! So I tested positive about 4 weeks ago and have been asymptomatic, which has been a big relief for me. In fact, I’ve been asymptomatic long enough that the state of Delaware has officially released me from quarantine, presuming that I’m totally done with the virus since ive had it long enough and never actually got sick. But there’s something kinda weird. Since March, before I got exposed, my asthma has been really bothering me. Now, I’ve talked to nurses about this and they’ve figured it’s just seasonal allergies. But every single night for a few months now, around 10pm I can feel my throat closing up and I have to grab my rescue inhaler. I haven’t had to use my inhaler like this for years. I’m the last week, it’s gotten muuuch more frequent. Where it was one puff every night since March, now it’s multiple instances a day. This morning I woke up wheezing. I went for my usual 7 mile bike ride today and had to give up 2 miles in because I started wheezing and my throat got tight. I should be done with COVID by now, and it’s unlikely that this was brought	Asthma has gotten much worse Hey everyone!

Anyone here experience brain fog and lethargy? What was it like/ did it effect studying?	Today is the last day of my quarantine. I got certain symptoms, really just loss of taste and smell, congestion and cold like headaches but no fever or cough, and I found it hard to do physical activities. But I wonder if this other thing I experienced might also be a symptom. Now honestly this very well may have just been me being lazy and distracted by the Internet, but I could not study at all during quarantine. Whether that has to do with lack of motivation due to never leaving my house, my own problems, or Covid itself is what I’m trying to figure out. Did anyone else experience this? I’ve always been a little bit of a procrastinator but never considered myself any worse than the average person. There was plenty of studying I could have done while I was stuck at home, but every time I tried I just couldn’t. Only an hour or so in and I would fall asleep, lose focus or talk myself out of it. I’ve always been able to make myself do things even if I didn’t really want to do them but I didn’t experience that here while I had coronavirus.	Anyone here experience brain fog and lethargy?

Post-Covid Symptoms	I caught COVID back in the end of June. 3-4 days of fatigue, body aches, and appetite loss, accompanied with the loss of smell of course. Now 2 1/2 months on from my diagnosis I have been having swollen lymph nodes and tonsils for about a week, along with minor sporadic sharp chest/abdomen pains . Doctor said they have seen dozens of college-aged individuals with these same sort of symptoms. Has anyone had this same experience or know what might be causing it?

My taste of smell and taste are not returning and all the food tastes horrible	I've had COVID (not offcially positive, since I haven't gotten tested yet but I'm fairly certain I had it) March 26 - April 4th. Very mild to no symptoms but I've lost all sense of smell and taste. I still haven't gotten it back but now (starting this week) I started tasting my food but everything tastes horrible all the smells and tastes have exactly the same characteristic, it's difficult to describe but the best I can do is like wet carboard. It's a very specific taste and it's disgusting. I'm forcing myself to eat and I'm trying to figure out what I can do in the meantime because it's really terrible. Is anyone else experiencing this?

How to fall asleep with chest pain?	I was tested positive less than a week ago, I have mild symptoms and I don't require hospitalisation. My question for others who've been positive is - how to fall asleep easier? Before sleep I take a painkiller, which does help, but doesn't eliminate the pain enough so I can ignore it and it gets irritating when trying to sleep. Is there a certain sleeping position, room temperature or anything else that helps? I was told by my doctor not to take more painkillers than prescribed.	How to fall asleep with chest pain?

Dexamethasone and Covid symptoms	My family members have started displaying COVID symptoms for 2 weeks. They are very likely with COVID they’ve had fever, muscle pain as if they had been beaten up and dry cough. My parents have medical doctor degrees and they are self diagnosing dexamethasone. Most of them have reported feeling better but my uncle and dad have not. In fact coughing with blood is one additional symptom they are displaying. They are continuing their dexamethasone treatment but I’m worried that this is actually weakening their immune system. The other family members took it for one or two days before starting recovery. What should I do? I’m no medical professional but it looks like it isn’t getting better and online articles suggest that the drug may suppress the immune system. Is this a case of a medical doctor being prideful? Or maybe fatigue due to disease? How can I mitigate this potentially fatal mistake? Additionally they have not practiced medicine for 10+ years but they are knowledgeable and have experience.

Anyone else experience something like this? Suspected covid, 1 pos test.	"Almost 3 weeks ago my daughter (6) tested positive for Covid after getting a runny nose and being sent home from school.

During this time, my wife tested negative twice, I tested negative twice, and my kids both tested negative once each (daughter was about a week apart from her first test and she was symptom free) Meanwhile, I was basically fine. I had an on/off 99.3-99.8 low grade fever and some chest tightness. Two days ago I was feeling like a million bucks. Chest was normal again. Feeling good. Fever seemed gone. I was feeling so good that I thought I should go get a Covid antibody test (I know I was a bit early) so I even went and did that yesterday morning. Results are not in yet. Then last night around 10pm I got smacked with a sock full of bricks. \- Fever came back spiking to 99.8 \- Runny nose started \- Chest started to feel ""rattly"" like there was congestion in my lungs \- Productive cough kicked off with light-yellow phlegm \- And general fatigue."

I'm afraid for myself and my whole family	I tested positive from a test I took last Monday. I was asymptomatic at the time. Since then I have developed extreme fatigue, shortness of breath when walking, chest pain when walking, and dizziness that comes and goes even if I am lying down. My mom also has COVID- she is a presumed positive as she has almost all of the key symptoms and is a nurse. Her symptoms are worse than mine and are only getting worse over time. Here's the kicker. My two other family members are severely at risk. Now, I don't live with them, but my mom obviously does and I'm very concerned. We always had a plan that if my mom got sick (which was always a possibility due to her job), my at risk family members would come stay with me. But now I am positive so they can't. I am afraid for what will happen if they catch it, they will both likely be hospitalized. For the first time in my life, I talked to my dad and had to reassure him instead of him reassuring me.

Pulse Ox Monitor - a word of caution	Please please please be cautious when using medical devices at home. I bought myself a pulse oximeter a while back (probably like many people here) as a way to reassure myself that I was ok to remain home. I checked this morning as I was feeling weak,like I was floating and the monitor read 91%. I was freaking out. Told my husband we needed to get me to the ER NOW! Thankfully we live within a less than 5 minute radius from a hospital. They get me in right away, taken to one of the “isolated” rooms away from the regular triage area and hooked up to monitors. My pulse ox was 100-99% the whole time i was there. Didn’t have a fever and was told my lungs sounded great. The nurse told me that many people with at home monitors have been coming in due to it giving a very low reading at home but in the ER they are doing just fine. Please make sure to use it properly, unlike I did, and save yourself a huge ER bill to be told your lungs are just fine (yes I’m in the US unfortunately).

She is in her early 90s, wheelchair bound, has dementia but still has a feisty side keeping her going. She’s been doing fine since her diagnosis and quarantine until 2 days ago. All of a sudden her esophagus swelled up to the size of a grapefruit. It is pushing on her heart and lungs and the doctors put her on a ventilator to help her breath because it’s causing so much pressure on these organs. The doctors have no idea why her esophagus swelled up like it did but we are wondering if it is a side effect of having COVID??? There is no signs of infection or damage either.

Possible Covid infection?	"Hi guys, Just a little post in which I ask to everyone what's my actual condition. Since the 7th of april, I started to have some breathing problems, however no cough and not even fever. I decide so to impose myself a strict home quarantine. Premising that I'm 20 and from Italy, actually from Turin, and that I haven't been out of my room since March 5th, till today I still have breathing problem, it's kind heavy breathing (if I try to do even the smallest physical activity it triggers my breath for a while). However, when I stay in the bed the problems seems wiped out. Due to stomachache and some problems in burping, doctor said that It might be a kind of ""gastric reflux "". However the breathing problems make me skeptical... I haven't been out more than a month, the only possibilitie is that a week ago a guy from my college (cause I live in a college) infected me, but why noone of the them is showing up any symptoms? It has been 10 day that my strict quarantine started, however the guys in the college are all fine! So what should it be? I can't"	"Possible Covid infection?

To those who’ve tested positive: is post-nasal drip a symptom?	I’ve got no fever, no dry cough, no headaches, no G.I. issues or fatigue. However I have been experiencing heightened postnasal drip for about two weeks now it doesn’t seem to be responding well to OTC meds. I feel the drip go down my throat, and it in turn gives me a wet cough that produces clear phlegm. Definitely feel sinus congestion. Has anyone else experienced this? Any need tips for how to treat it?	To those who’ve tested positive: is post-nasal drip a symptom? I’ve got no fever, no dry cough, no headaches, no G.I. issues or fatigue.

Anxiety or Coronavirus?	I’ve been self quarantined with my family since March 11th. Have taken every precaution.

Is it possible I may have gotten it?	I’m so sorry if I sound like I’m ill informed because I’ve been trying to stay informed, but I’ve been having so much anxiety over this and worry about my health that sometimes it overwhelms me too much. I’m 19 years old and I’m obese. I believe my BMI is around 45 so I’m at high risk from what I know and this has been absolutely terrifying for me. I haven’t left the house since February and the only people who do leave are my step dad and mom but my stepdad works and my mom goes grocery shopping every week or so. I want to believe this is anxiety? My chest feels heavy off and on right now and my throat has this feeling like I have to cough. It feels warm and it’s bothersome. Slightly scratchy. That’s all I’m really feeling besides tired (I had taken a melatonin two hours ago so that explains that). This started happening after I started really thinking about this and started freaking out about it. It’s coming and going right now and I’m fluctuating between calming down and freaking out again.

Neck glands, ear pain, and insomnia oh my!	Timeline: I started feeling symptoms 5/13: crazy exhaustion, ear pain, eye pain and itching, mild sore throat. 5/14 I did telemedicine and doctor decided I had an allergy-induced secondary sinus infection. Started doxycycline. 5/16, I spiked a fever of 101.6 and my gland pain in neck reached point of true misery. 5/17 I was tested and received positive test result Monday, 5/18. On Friday, 5/22, I called my doctor over concern of the 94 pulsox report, and she assured me it’s ok and told me to start taking 1200 mg of mucinex and an albuterol inhaler 2 puffs/4x daily. I’ve been doing the Cuomo breathing exercises as well. I felt a little brighter and less painful for the first time on Sunday. 5/24. I stopped taking advil. Had pretty good days 5/24-26. Then last night: felt painful again and had low grade fever of 99.2. Today has been same with 99.5. I went back to taking advil.

Does this sound familiar?	I’ll be tested tomorrow as doctors say it sounds like the corona. Just wondering if this all sounds familiar to those who have tested positive. 5/18 woke up with sore throat on right side top of throat and a headache 5/19 sore throat switched sides and the left side was sore and not the right still at top of throat and headache. 5/20 whole throat sore and felt like it’s sore lower today and the top end is fine. slight headache. 5/21 sore throat more like a scratchy nuisance but has moved lower. No headache. 5/22 no sore throat but feels like there is congestion. Voice is being lost. No headache. 5/23 to today cough develops but is only prominent during the evening before bed and when I wake up. Slight coughing throughout the day here and there. Cough isn’t productive, but I can bring up some nasty looking colorful phlegm especially with a sneeze and when I wake up. Since last weekend this has made its way through my house to wife and so far at least one child. It honestly feels like a cold and I wouldn’t have thought anything more had we not been in a pandemic.

24 F -DAY 16	So I was working at a nursing home up until April 7. I got tested on the April 14 but had been feeling symptoms starting April 10th. On the 10th I had a stuffy nose &amp; couldn’t stop sneezing. Since then I have lost my sense of taste &amp; smell. Around the 20th -23 i was sure that my senses were coming back but now I’m not so sure. I can barely smell anything nor taste. Like if something’s spicy my tongue will be hot but that’s it really. I’ve gotten retested on April 29th so now I’m waiting for my results. This past day id say I’ve been on an a decline &amp; im not sure if It’s my anxiety or if it’s covid. I’ve been really hot but not necessarily a fever and my breathing has been a bit shallow.	24 F -DAY 16 So I was working at a nursing home up until April 7.

Did you have symptoms but your partner had zero symptoms or vice versa?	I'm on day 8 of 99.5 to100-degree fever. Started out looking like a sinus infection but sinuses are cleared up and fever still lingers. Fever typically comes between noon and tapers off by 6 pm. Only symptoms I'm experiencing right now are the fever, some dizziness, loose stools and sometimes congestion. My husband has some congestion but nothing else, not even a fever. I'm waiting for my test results, but am curious if it's normal for one to be experiencing symptoms and the other to have absolutely nothing. I do have blood type A and he is O so I wonder if that has anything to do with it if it does come back positive.	Did you have symptoms but your partner had zero symptoms or vice versa?

Question from my 67yr old mum- on day 33 and recovering	So quick background for context My mum had a very high fever for 16 days, paracetamol wouldn’t bring it down. Chills body aches dizziness, difficulty breathing We have an oxygen concentrator at the house for my 80yr old father - she used that a lot from day 8 when things took a turn for the worse. She had a horrible taste in her mouth, GI issues, extreme nausea she couldn’t eat. Extreme exhaustion Fever finally subsided- after a few days of going away for a few hours and then returning at night Anyway now we’re 2 weeks after the fever Her breathing is ok- and some days she feels fine She is a clean freak and isn’t really impressed with my attempts so keeps trying to do housework on days when she feels ok But then a few hours later she is knocked back down again One thing she keeps experiencing and she wanted me to ask if anyone else is getting the same- her face keeps turning very red, her cheeks become very flushed - and her face feels hot.

For those anxious to hit the gym...	I was one of those people who was a little cautious about hitting the gym once it reopened. They reopened here in Florida in May and I waited a good 2-3 weeks to see how things went before returning. At first things seemed ok, except they were not taking temps and maybe 3 people would wear masks. Even employees were barefaced. About two weeks ago, they started doing temp checks and all employees started wearing masks, so I felt a little more secure. I would go in wearing a mask, but would eventually overheat and cave into peer pressure, so it would be completely off my face by the time I hit my second exercise. Last Saturday, I got extremely nauseated, migraine, headache and woke up with a 102 fever. By Wednesday the fever and headaches and nausea went away. I was completely in denial, telling myself it was just a migraine causing all of this, but in reality I knew it was Covid. On Wednesday night I completely lost my sense of smell and about 60% of taste. Everything tastes like it’s watered down. Right now I have a bit of a runny nose, but otherwise feeling completely normal.	For those anxious to hit the gym...

Should I isolate? Having mild symptoms	Hi all, sorry if these types of questions are annoying, I just want to be sure I'm being safe and keeping my loved ones safe as well. I woke up with a slightly sore throat, almost like a tickle in the back of my throat that has lasted all day. Breathing also feels a bit strange sometimes. My temperature is 97.8°, do I need to self isolate? I also have allergy problems, so it's hard to know. What do you guys think? Thank you!	Should I isolate?

Retesting	So it’s been 16 days since I tested positive. I have been quarantine and I have recovered. Worst that happened is I had a fever for 3 days. After that I felt allot better. However like many I have lost my taste and smell. I notice it’s coming back slowly, very slowly. Sometimes I even feel like I lose it again but gain it back the next day. I want to get retested because I am tired of being stuck at home and I want to work. If I still have this symptom of not smelling, will I still test positive for it? Should I go get retested or wait?

My step son was in close contact with his COVID nurse stepmom over the past few days. He is with us after she was sent home yesterday due to COVID symptoms and was tested today. If she is positive should we have my step son tested and should we be self isolating until his results come back?	It's a unique situation and I can't seem to find anything online for guidance. I do have some underlying health concerns (49, overweight with sleep apnea) and my wife does too so there is a risk and I know teenagers aren't always symptomatic when they're positive. I know this sounds premature but the stepmother has a good chance of being positive as there has been a spike of positives on her floor in the past week and I'd like to get ahead of this as best I can to protect those around us.

Long illness Antibody test Negative	Ok I don’t like sounding like I am a nut job. What if something else is spreading and they aren’t looking for it because of Corona? What if this disease isn’t what they think it is? A lot of people had to get 3+ pcr tests before testing positive. I feel like we are being duped. Tested positive in March still have symptoms. Same with my daughter. NO antibodies. I see a lot of people don’t have them but the asymptomatic people test for them. How is this possible? This virus is not cut and dry. Something else is going on. I know I sound insane but I have never been more terrified in my life. Like what if I have caught a different virus they don’t even know to look for that is killing me slowly? I’m tired maybe that’s why I’m so paranoid. But what are the chances there is something else going on?!	Long illness Antibody test Negative Ok I don’t like sounding like I am a nut job.

Still experiencing bothersome symptoms?	Thank you to everyone who has been contributing to posts and comments on here, it has genuinely been helpful in a time when symptoms are so amorphous. I started experiencing symptoms on January 27th, and it only started as a sore throat in the beginning. In the days after, I started to develop really bad body aches, extreme fatigue and not being able to stay up, and constipation and nausea. I never had a bad fever or significant shortness of breath, but I do feel like i have decreased lung capacity and I lost my sense of smell on July 3rd. I did get tested through drive-testing in Houston on January 29th, but I have yet to receive my results. I am really frustrated with contacting Harris County Public Health because it has literally been 11 days, and I have not gotten any documentation back. However, I am just presuming that I have COVID bc I did lose my sense of smell. Currently, I have a stuffy nose, a scratchy throat, dry eyes, and this burning sensation in my nose.

End of May I was ready to graduate from Covid, I was 100% , did long walks, energy was back, SOB disappeared, numb fingers resolved.. then 4th June, out of nowhere, I had bad inflammation on my cartilage/sternum, it gradually went away during the course of last week. Last evening my SOB (mild) came back, started to have muscle twitches (around left eye, thigh), and night sweat ( never in my life, nor during the 12 weeks of covid).. what more can I do to help symptoms and not get worse. are we going to have permanent nerve damage? sorry about this negative post, not in a happy place, slept 4 hours last night, 10hours conf call ahead , going to be a long day!

Anyone else feeling nervous about coming out of self isolation to rejoin their housemates/family once considered “cleared” by a doctor?	Hey everyone - I hope you are all doing well! 27/f here who tested positive on Tuesday, 3/24 (symptoms started 17 days ago). I have been in communication with my doctor who technically considers me “cleared” to leave my bedroom/self isolation to join my roommates in the rest of our house to continue sheltering in place. I have been symptom free (contagious symptoms like cough, fever, sneeze etc) for 9 days now and only still have lack of sense/smell lingering (what my doctor told me is considered a “side effect symptom” - not contagious. My point here is although I am technically cleared to join my housemates (7 days symptom free, the last 3 of which have zero cough or fever without the aid of Tylenol) I am feeling hesitant to do so. The doctors won’t “retest” me (for good reasoning) to see if I’m considered negative now, but I just wonder if this virus is in fact still in me and spreadable even with just some lack of taste/smell? My house mates both have compromised immune systems so I am self isolating for an extra week just in case, but I’m wondering if anyone else is almost feeling guilty	Anyone else feeling nervous about coming out of self isolation to rejoin their housemates/family once considered “cleared” by a doctor?

I’m beginning to think that it’s more than just allergies...?	I’ve been having symptoms for a little over a week now. Began with an itchy throat, then a small cough that would only come because of the itch. Then it developed into congestion that I heavily combatted, until I eventually lost my sense of taste/smell completely. In fact, I’ve never lost it for this long. And I’m not even congested anymore, so it’s strange that it still hasn’t come back to me. If I inhale deeply over something fragrant (coffee grounds, cleaners, etc.) I catch a whiff, but I still cannot taste. Went to the ER a few nights ago: no fever, chest x-Ray looked great, as did bloodwork, so the doctor didn’t want to test me because he was certain I didn’t have it. I went in because I had been having diarrhea for two weeks and I thought I was fatigued and dehydrated from it. Turns out, I wasn’t, and everything was normal. But now the area where my kidneys are is very sore. Like, it could be a strained muscle in my back (I’ve been able to crack my upper back for days now to relieve a tightness in that area), but the sensation has been there	I’m beginning to think that it’s more than just allergies...?

23M Trying to figure out how far along I am	So last week my Manager closed our store because she was showing various symptoms (Fatigue, sore throat, cough, and chest pains). I haven’t gone out outside of work and the store for weeks now. But about a week and a half ago I noticed I was getting random dizzy spells. They would come and go and sometimes linger a bit. I though nothing of it until one day at work the room started spinning and I almost fell. Fast forward to today (about 12 days later) I woke up with constant dizziness and a little confusion. It was very intense to the point where I had a mini panic attack and couldn’t move or see straight. Currently it is still going on but I have been staying hydrated and taking Tylenol to try and negate the feeling. I am getting tested tomorrow but it feels to me that I definitely have Covid even if considered a mild case. Curious to know what to do moving forward and if I am far along or just beginning with this.	23M Trying to figure out how far along I am So last week my Manager closed our store because she was showing various symptoms (Fatigue, sore throat, cough, and chest pains).

Does this sound like covid?	On 3/16 I got sick. Fever with bad headaches. I had this low grade fever 101 the highest. I had fatigue and congestion. I had a fever until 3/29. No other symptoms. I had this feeling the entire time where I felt like I’m about to get chills. I felt good for like two days. Then the headaches started again. And on 4/1 I started feeling pressure in my chest. 4/3 I developed a cough, but I cough maybe once an hour if I had to add them all up. Cough feels the same but my chest hurts a lot more when I cough. I’m tired. Sometimes I feel out of breath, but it’s very rare. And I’ve had the same headache. Do you guys think I may be positive? Has anyone experienced similar things. I have an appointment with my dr Monday.	Does this sound like covid? On 3/16 I got sick. Fever with bad headaches. I had this low grade fever 101 the highest.

What is your opinion on colleges reopening?	I myself have not had COVID-19, but I have many family members and friends who are high-risk, and I myself have been highly judging the admin at certain colleges that have opted to do in-person classes, no matter if they’re on a hybrid schedule or fully in-person. So I thought I would ask you all what your opinion is on this, as most or all of you have experienced this illness first hand. What do you think of schools doing this? Even with their precautions in place, do you think it’s safe? Do you have any “bets” for when colleges will go completely virtual?	What is your opinion on colleges reopening?

A Breakdown if Symptoms for mild case	So, over the weekend (8/30) I noticed my sense of smell was a bit dulled through to 8/31. By Tuesday, it was completely gone. I wasn’t stuffed up or otherwise feeling ill but the Tuesday night I got hit by a train. I was having diarrhea, headaches and was exhausted. I took my temperature and never had a fever. By Wednesday morning my sense of taste was gone as well and I was so sick I just didn’t want to leave my bed. I was exhausted. Today is better! I feel a lot like I’ve snorted water and had some small sinus head aches. I still can’t taste or smell but my ability to move around and do things is greatly improved. I got a rapid result test and it came back positive for COVID. That’s pretty much it for now. I am one of the lucky ones.

Active infection or post-viral? Or nothing at all?	Hi all. So I think I began having symptoms around mid-March. I began having headaches, which persisted for about 2-3 weeks. I attributed it to staring at a screen all day (I’m in college and taking all my classes online now) around week 2 however, I had one bout of diarrhea out of nowhere, and two days before that I noticed my sense of smell and taste was barely there. Week 3-4 my headaches slowly disappeared, but I told my symptoms to my county health hotline and they sent me for testing. I tested negative, but still tried to stay as isolated as possible just in case. After testing negative, I began developing a sore throat and a crackly feeling in my chest. I woke up out of a sound sleep 2 weeks ago feeling like my heart was going to burst out of my chest. I checked it was 135, which was concerning considering I was asleep two seconds before. I went to the ER, where I was diagnosed with early stage pneumonia. Around this time I also began developing an elevated temp (99-99.5). I got tested a second time because of the pneumonia, (last Monday, I went to	Active infection or post-viral? Or nothing at all? Hi all. So I think I began having symptoms around mid-March.

I’m terrified	So I tested today after possible exposure. Now before I knew about the exposure I had a little itch in my throat but that’s it. But idk if I’m developing symptoms or if it’s in my head.

Post-viral, should I still be worried about infecting others?	I believe I was originally infected back in early March and was experiencing covid like symptoms. SOB, walking pneumonia, chest pressure, cough, but no fever. I isolated for several weeks and was finally able to get a covid test in my area. I tested negative on June 1st and retested again on June 15th which also came back negative. I've had some annoying post-viral symptoms that seem to finally be clearing up. I haven't been able to get a antibody test yet. Should I be worried about infecting others while post-viral?	Post-viral, should I still be worried about infecting others?

When does it get worse? If it does?	Hi! I posted a couple of days ago when I tested positive. Currently 21 year old healthy male. Symptoms started about 5 days ago, tested positive 3 days ago. I feel like I have a mild almost asymptomatic case. Started with allergy like symptoms and today I feel almost perfect, still slightly stuffy nose and very light cough. I never had a fever, aggressive cough, fatigue, soar throat just felt like allergies all along. The only thing giving me anxiety is that I have read online that for some people, they improve but then all of sudden they get hit hard. Anybody have an experience like this? Honestly if I did not test myself I would of gone for my normal morning run because of how good I feel, but will this be short lived? Thanks.	When does it get worse? If it does? Hi!

My symptoms so far... whats the likelihood I'm positive? Tested yesterday, awaiting results...	Hey guys. I just spent last week on vacation out in Vegas, traveled to Illinois, and then back home from there. I've always worn a mask, wash hands regularly, and taken the preventative measures. I got home Saturday night and began noticing symptoms two days later. Day 1: Monday I began to have a dry cough all throughout the day. It definitely seemed unusual. By the end of the day, I noticed I was wayyy more tired than I should be and could tell I was getting sick with something. Day 2: Yesterday. I woke up feeling like I had a full blown cold. Very miserable, like a head cold. Headache came &amp; left. Some body aches, but nothing crazy. No fever. Some loss of appetite. A lot of congestion and runny nose. Got tested for Covid but still waiting on results. Day 3: Today. Woke up feeling the same. Occasionally I get waves of feeling more &amp; more miserable, almost like a fever would be coming out (start becoming very hot in the head) but I check my temperature and I'm normal.

Took rapid test today. I’m positive. This really sucks. Just want to vent if that’s okay here.	Hey everyone. I went and tested today and it was positive. It really sucks. I been in the bedroom and wife and son came home early from job/school. But, they’re not showing symptoms so I’m staying confined to the bedroom until they get tested. It’s crazy how rapid it advances in your body and how quickly symptoms show up. I mean within the last 2 days I’ve lost all smell and taste and feel worse after finding out I was positive. Idk if this is a mental trick or what but my only symptoms right now are loss of smell/taste, throat kind of sore/closed up a little, and nostril pain. No chugging or anything. But I can tell it’s rapidly increasing symptoms. Just want this world back to normal. I always wear a mask and have been very cautious, I thought... Anyways, I’ve been on Reddit all day because it’s helping me cope and I love Reddit, but damn, I miss my family who are just outside of the room, my wife, son and dog. But it’s for the best.

When to move, What to do, What's Worthy of ER?	Hello all. 26M, no Hx of drinking or smoking and active, but overweight. About two weeks ago I went into a local urgent care after I had chest heaviness for about a week following two weeks of digestive symptoms (stabbing stomach pains, runs, bloating). I got my results back last tuesday, negative despite my still persisting symptoms. I've been acting as if I am positive regardless because of symptoms, and taking a combined medicine of Albuterol (inhaler), Tylenol and Mucinex twice daily to reduce inflammation and purge any sort of phlegm, with mixed results. No fever, but scary symptoms that make me eye an ER stay? I've been super, super dizzy for the last week, to the point of having to out my head down to stop the room from spinning. I'm almost having what I would describe as heart discomfort? I have heart palpitations every once in a while normally but this seems more so like a weird wriggling. I'm also experiencing a slow but noticable drop in my Ox Meter, from a 98% avg to a 96-95% avg as I notice more worsening chest Symptoms. At what point would a trip to the ER make sense?

Not feeling 100%	A few days ago, a scratchy throat, swollen glands in my neck, and feeling achy started, kind of like I am fighting a cold. My symptoms have not been getting worse. I do not have a fever or any of the other common signs of Covid. I have only been out of the house twice in the last two weeks to do grocery shopping and get gas. Testing places are closed for the long weekend in my area. Are summer colds going around or should I be concerned about this being Covid?

Was itchy and runny nose part of your symptoms? (I’m in vaccine trail.)	I’m in the vaccine trail and will report my symptoms as required and they will tell me what to do from there. They will most likely require me to test tomorrow and I’ll follow their directions. (I’m 99% sure I had the placebo so covid is always a possibility for me.) BUT, I’m just curious and wanted to ask those that had it. I have an unusually itchy and runny nose that seems like the common cold. I also have had a headache and extremely minor fatigue. No way that’s covid right? I’m a teacher so it’s probably a cold or allergies? What were your first symptoms? Just curious, can’t sleep and probably can’t work tomorrow so I’m up on the internet lol.

To people like me, or those without pre existing conditions in the lungs, would you think I would have severe symptoms? Sorry if the question isn’t clear, or if it’s just kind of stupid.

Think I might have it but it’s very tricky. Here are my symptoms. Someone take a look, please.	Hi everyone. Last Friday, I woke up feeling nauseous. I went to the bathroom but it didn’t help. As soon as I left the bathroom, I got intense chills and developed a fever. Shortly after, I threw up. The first 2 times must have been some food and the 3rd time, I threw up bile. Right before I threw up the bile, I was on the verge of passing out. It was the bile coming out that saved me. Strangely enough, after I threw up that last time, my symptoms seemingly disappeared. I thought it was over, but I was wrong. My fever persisted but that was it. No sore throat, no runny nose, no congestion, just a fever and back and stomach pain. That’s it. Over the next few days I felt weak and my fever would come and go. Then I woke up with sharp throat pain and a cough. The throat pain went away within a day but the cough persisted. The cough got worse by day, and it was dry, very dry. I’d cough and cough but it would feel like there was absolutely nothing in my throat to be coughing up. My fever also came	Think I might have it but it’s very tricky. Here are my symptoms. Someone take a look, please. Hi everyone. Last Friday, I woke up feeling nauseous.

Feeling drunk?	Anyone else have a drunken feeling from covid? It only started today, symptoms appeared a few days ago, but I can't describe it any other way than that mental delay and vertigo you get any time you move while drunk. My focus, speech, and breathing are still manageable while still so I'm not too worried; just curious if anyone else had similar symptoms?	Feeling drunk?

Likelihood of false positive?	A friend of mine went out to a bar with someone who tested positive (they read their test results wrong) they were in contact for a few hours. My friend and their roommates got a test immediately after finding out, maybe 12 hours after contact. They got a throat swab and all their tests were negative. What’s the likelihood that it was a false negative? I know the throat swab isn’t as accurate as the nasal swab and with them getting tested less than 24 hours after contact with the positive person I imagine it can’t be too accurate right? I’m concerned because all of these people are going out and having parties and I feel like I should warn them, but I don’t want to seem like I’m being dramatic or paranoid.

Was COVID+ in July, today I biked 14 miles	I hated having COVID. I had the worst sinus pressure I have every experienced in my life. There were nights when I would wake up and I couldn’t breathe in; I was terrified of falling asleep. I felt like I couldn’t take a proper deep breath, and sometimes I still don’t. But today I biked 14 miles with my mask on at moderate/high intensity. I was in bed for days on end in July, and I’m finally getting back in the groove of how I used to be. Warm wishes to everyone here; there is a light at the end. You just gotta be patient.	Was COVID+ in July, today I biked 14 miles I hated having COVID.

Vent: Frustrated by brainlessness	I hope this vent is okay.. I want to hear other people’s thoughts on it too. How are others responding to the crazy conspiracy theorists online and the nutjobs currently protesting isolation measures? As someone that’s survived COVID-19, I’m getting pretty tired of it all. There is so much toxicity being generated that it’s becoming really unnerving! Racism towards East Asians, conspiracy theories about cell phone towers, denialism of this and really any virus... it’s pure craziness beyond crazy! I’m trying to keep a compassionate view of everything: people are scared, don’t know what to do, but want to feel in control in any way they can. I just hope that it doesn’t lead to faster spread, second waves and the like... this is not the kind of thing to eff around with!	Vent: Frustrated by brainlessness I hope this vent is okay..

roommates refuse to quarantine	I am in college and just tested positive for COVID. My roommates were saying we will all quarantine together, but they have been inviting people over and going to people's houses. They say they are only going places and inviting people over who have already had COVID and don't mind being around people who were exposed. I honestly just think they are being so stupid. They are also having a party on Wednesday and Friday for a roommates 21st. I ended up coming home because I was too stressed and mad at them for not quarantining.

Sense of smell coming and going. Anyone else?	My sense of smell was completely gone when I was sick, which was expected, but since recovering I’ve noticed that it sort of comes and goes. I’ll go a few hours with an annoyingly sensitive sense of smell, and then half a day not being able to smell anything. Anyone else experiencing this after recovering? Additional information: 30F, overweight, slightly elevated BP. Had all the typical symptoms, was tested, and five days later the results were negative. My doctor told me to assume it was a false negative because my symptoms were “textbook.” I felt mostly recovered after 20 days, with the exception of this olfactory situation. Not at all complaining; just curious if anyone else is getting their sense of smell back sporadically.	Sense of smell coming and going. Anyone else?

Shortness of breath/can’t get a full breath	Hello, I (21m) (heavy weed smoker since 16 until being ill) (no underlying health issues) am currently on day 7 with some questions for those who are also positive. I started with throwing up, tight chest, and diarrhea with a 99.3 fever first 3 days. The 4th day my fever resided and since then (day 4-7) I have just experienced tightness of my chest and having trouble taking a full breath as well as GI issues. My blood oxygen saturation has stayed between 95-97 (usually 97-99) and I can still get oxygen in to my lungs it is just a very uncomfortable feeling and feels inflamed or damaged. I had an x-ray done yesterday and it revealed what my doctor told me was a “clear chest” telling me I am “perfectly fine” however I’m not sure how accurate that is on account of what I am experiencing and the fact that it was not a cat scan. Everywhere I read the symptom shortness of breath it is usually followed by (in severe cases). I am just curious if anyone else out there is experiencing this without continuing onwards respiratory distress or hospitalization.

I had the freckle thing before in 2008 when I had a really bad flu. Have a family history of skin cancer. I guess I will have to see the dermatologist at some point soon.	Skin issues?

Question to smokers Thc/Nic	Hello all, This maybe controversial or whatever but I would love to hear about your smoking habits during and after being positive. I was hit pretty hard by the virus. My 02 levels were fine throughout it but constantly had the feeling that I couldn’t breath and that my breathing was more manual. I am just getting over corona and the breathing issues come back every once and a while. During covid before I even tested positive I instantly quit vaping and smoking weed judt incase it would cause my condition to worsen. Recently I’m scared to go back to smoking, but without weed my anxiety has been through the roof. I know there are other options but just wanted to see others input.

Uncomfortable question	I got notified last week of a positive case at my workplace-- my office mate (who never ever wore her mask ... But that's another story). Protocol dictated I had to get tested prior to returning to work and wouldn't you know it, I tested positive. I've been so very fortunate to have very few and mild symptoms: stuffy nose, sore throat, some back pain and very mild fever- all symptoms I had noticed but thought it was just allergies or lifting something heavy. I'm on day 5 of self isolation and am hoping this is the worst of it. I've not gone anywhere besides work and the grocery store since March, and I don't believe anyone aside from my cat has seen me sans mask since then as well. So hopefully I did not share this with anyone else. My question is... And forgive me if this is crude... Has anyone who's tested positive noticed that their urine smells... Spicy? It just started a few days ago and Google has helped none. Thanks. And sorry.

Tested positive - my symptoms and timeline	I've been coming here a lot the last few days to check what others have said about contracting and symptoms, and have just tested positive, so thought I would share. I stayed with a friend on Tuesday (allowed within lockdown rules where I live). It was just a girly catch up with some wine and food. She lives on her own. And then on Saturday I received a call from her to let me know that someone she had visited prior to us getting together had tested positive for COVID. She had taken a test and I booked one for the next day (Sunday) as it was evening. Earlier on the Saturday before she called, I had a very slight rattle in one of my lungs which I had noticed and found odd. It didn't hurt and I'm not prone to lung/breathing issues. I didn't have a cough. Just an odd feeling/sound at the bottom of my left lung when I breathed deeply. And then it went away again. On the Sunday I woke up with a headache that seemed to originate behind my eyes, and inflamed sinuses.

I went to work and wife dropped her off at babysitters and went to work. Got a phone call at noon saying I had to go pick her up she had a fever. She was at 101.9 when I got home with her and I checked. She’s basically been laying down and resting. Noticed what almost looks like a few hives on her cheeks and her tongue, while it looks normal in color, kind of reminds me of how strawberry skin looks. Those big seeds all over. Those are pretty red and almost look swollen. I gave her Tylenol as soon as we got home, and 2 hours later zero fever. At 97.9. Something seems odd. Why/how could the fever go away so quickly? Checked at babysitters using theirs, and then 2 of my own just to make sure. She says nothing hurts just tired and when she ate a banana earlier her throat felt funny but feels fine now. I called the dr just to be safe and was basically told just to monitor her. Im probably overreacting because of covid, but im	Dr wont see my child but has weird symptoms Question for anyone who has had positive children My 6 year old slept in very late today she’s usually up at 5am with me.

When did you test negative?	"Hi all, I'm very grateful to be in recovery, and am doing well, generally. The bulk of my course was about **15-20** days, with days # **5-16** being the peak ""swell"" of my worst symptoms. &lt; JFC that was horrible. Anyway, I started feeling slowly better by day # **~18/19/20**. I was re-tested on day **30**, which my doctor's office thought was enough time for me to finish shedding whatever viral load I had. That 2nd time, I tested positive again... sh!t Wondering what range of time people have experienced before they finally tested negative? Thanks, for any data! ______________________________________ Very grateful to be mostly on the other side of this thing, and wish everyone here good health, good days, and hope for the future. 👍"	"When did you test negative?

Has anyone developed a sinus arrhythmia over this?	I recently got back my CT scan, bloodwork and ekg results. First two were clean, but the ekg showed a sinus arrhythmia. Back in Jan I had another ekg for another reason and it came out perfect, so this is new. I had covid at the beginning of April with symptoms lasting until late June (35m long hauler). Has anyone developed anything similar?	Has anyone developed a sinus arrhythmia over this? I recently got back my CT scan, bloodwork and ekg results.

Employer wants me to return to work August 3rd	I tested positive in early July and am still experiencing some of the lingering effects of COVID. My employer wants to to return to work August 3rd, but I don’t feel safe being around an office full of people. I expressed this and now they are asking for a note from a doctor stating the need to work from home. What’s the best way to go about this? Would I need to go to urgent care and just ask for a note? Any advice is appreciated.	Employer wants me to return to work August 3rd I tested positive in early July and am still experiencing some of the lingering effects of COVID.

It really happened to me... (no symptoms)	I spent 3.5 months locked in my house in a rural town that had but a few cases. I wore a mask when I went through drive throughs and I did Walmart pick ups. I was as safe as you can be. I spent 1... 1 single day with my girlfriend for her birthday And 1 day with my boys group as the lockdown had ended and everyone wanted to see me. I then took a test so I could visit my family...and I tested positive.	It really happened to me... (no symptoms) I spent 3.5 months locked in my house in a rural town that had but a few cases.

Need some reassurance about chest pain	For background I am 39F, virus free since 5/13. Last week I backtracked in my recovery, had stomach upset and loss of appetite, congestion and renewed sinus pressure. Started eating again but two days later had SOB and palpitations. Dr prescribed inhalers and sent me for a chest x-ray, which was clear, and put me on a waiting list for holter monitor. Meanwhile, I've been experiencing chest tightness and mild aches, as well as arm, armpit and shoulder/upper back pain. Thing is I often have pain in my left arm due to a bad back/pinched nerve, but the pain has never been in the chest area and usually only down the outer arm. So I don't know what to think - should I be worried about the tightness? From earlier posts here it seems to be a common symptom and resolves itself without intervention. The PA I spoke with today didn't sound worried and said to wait for the holter.	Need some reassurance about chest pain For background I am 39F, virus free since 5/13.

Symptoms	My boyfriend and I were both just tested yesterday. We are both experiencing the same pain in the same spot on the back of our head. He is far more sick than I am. He has been sneezing, coughing, congested, &amp; feverish for days now with a headache. I feel like I have a minor case of strep throat. My head hurts from time to time and I haven’t ran much of a fever. My first symptom was feeling a coating on the roof of my mouth. Today I woke up and feel like my tongue is BURNT... like really burnt. I keep getting a sharp pain in the side of my head that makes us hard to keep my right eye open. Has anyone else experienced headaches like these or the feeling of their tongue being severely burned?	Symptoms My boyfriend and I were both just tested yesterday.

What Helped You With Your Recovery	I got sick in May 20th, 2020 which started as dry cough and turned into a wet cough. I don't have the sudden chest pain, shortness of breath and raging heart rates anymore but wheezing still continues even after 37 days. Anyone who recovered from Covid 19, what helped you to recovery your lungs from wheezing, pneumonia and etc? I tried supplements such as Vitamin C, Quercetin, NAC, ALA, Vitamin D3, Vitamin B complexes in different times as trial but all of them made me worse or prolonged the recovery. I have to cough constantly to try to take out the mucus from my lungs and I feel like not progressing. I went to doctor and she said take steroid inhaler but that also made me cough worse. I can go for a hiking or running with no problem and my blood oxygen level is 96%-100% but wheezing and mucus in my lungs won't leave me alone. I would appreciate anything that helped you with your progress. To clarify I have never had Asthma or COPD any lung issues before I became sick, lost 17 pound that I feel like I can't gain weight and have no appetite.

Just tested positive	34m, smoker, drinker, and slightly overweight. I started with a dry cough on Sunday, which led to a sore throat on Monday and mild drainage. Now Thursday, I am experiencing body aches and slight fever hovering around 100. Seems like a mild case but I guess you never know, pretty sure I got it from my boss as we were not wearing masks at our desks in the office and he is positive as well. Wear your mask!

My SO and I live together and after I tested positive he got tested and are waiting on results( he has no symptoms). We’ve been separating but wondering what the next steps look like. If he’s positive can we stop quarantining? If it’s negative do we stay quarantined? What have other people been doing? Thanks!	27F/ Covid + Question on Spouses Hey y’all.

Question to those with asthma	I have had shortness of breath for about 4-5 weeks now and it is beginning to subside a bit, but remains constantly. My Covid test was negative but my doctor said it could have been a false negative. After a visit to the ER due to severe SOB, clots were ruled out and my lungs were completely clear of fluid based on a chest x ray and CT scan. I never had any other covid symptoms. I saw a specialist today that believes I actually have asthma. I've had a history of allergies but never tested for asthma. I've been given a steroid puffer for now until I can go for a pulmonary function test. I'm nervous that if it were the virus (and not asthma) and my body was successfully fighting it off, throwing a steroid puffer into the mix could impact my body's immuity or mask worsening breathing symptoms.

Did any long-termer have a fever? Did any short-termer not have a fever?	Hi, I was just thinking about the theory that if you had a fever you fought off the virus and are really recovered, but that if you didn't (or if it was low), the virus had fooled your immune system and you were kind of screwed. So, could you please share your experience? Thank you! In my case I never had a fever but have had symptoms for almost three months.	Did any long-termer have a fever?

Back in March I came down with a bad cough which then turned into a productive cough. I started coughing up all sort of nasty yellow phlegm. I tried to get an appointment with a doctor at the time however I was unable to as covid was a health scare. I was told to to rest and wait it out, but this wasn't going away. In late March I succeeded in getting an appointment with a doctor who prescribed me various steroids and an an inhaler, which did nothing. After calling back I was then prescribed antibiotics over the phone. A 10-day course of antibiotics which wrapped up in the beginning of April. During that course of antibiotics, I began to experience heavy chest tightness. I called the doctor back and was prescribed a 2nd inhaler. It is important to know I am not an asthmatic.

presumed positive- pain and spasms in chest	I have been having symptoms for over a week now. Started with a dry cough which has worsened over the past week. Then came the chest pain, shortness of breath, and a day of diarrhea. Over the past few days I’ve had a constant spasming type feeling in my chest, I was tested on Monday (no results yet) but presumed positive for COVID. Has anyone else been experiencing chest pain and a spasming in their chest? Also laying down makes it 10x worse. I feel like there is sandbags on my chest at night and have had to sleep propped up. Any suggestions on what has given you some relief would be helpful. thanks.	presumed positive- pain and spasms in chest I have been having symptoms for over a week now.

I got back and after a while started to feel queasy and nauseous to the point where I threw up once. Fast forward to today I feel quite tired, my eyes are quite heavy and I feel a slight pressure in my head (not sure if I am imagining it or not) but no longer nauseous/vomiting. I checked my temperature and it is normal. I hadn't gone for a cycle in ages, usually I'm fine after going on one. I never move around too much on planes, rollercoasters and ferries as I tend to feel really dizzy and vomit. Should I be worried?	Should I be freaking out?

Can reactive lymph nodes be the only symptom?	Hi everyone just curious. I tested negative a month ago. I had an ultrasound today because the last few days I noticed two of my lymph nodes were the size of walnuts. Apparently they are just reactive lymph nodes and are fighting an infection. But it was odd to me because I didn’t know I was sick, I have zero symptoms. Maybe it is just a bacterial infection?	Can reactive lymph nodes be the only symptom? Hi everyone just curious.

Update &amp; Question to Ambushed by Family post	I spoke with my doctors office and it is recommended I be tested and quarantine until results come in. How bad is this test? I ask this because my disease causes me to have tremors and spasms. One of the more worrisome things I suffer from are facial tremors that worsen with stress and stimulation. This definitely fits the bill and being high risk, I’m scared. I don’t know how I am going to be able to hold still let alone control my facial tremors while being tested. I don’t want to hurt myself and cause more damage. Can a throat culture be done? I still can’t believe my own Mother disregarded my personal safety knowing I have brain disease 😥	Update &amp; Question to Ambushed by Family post I spoke with my doctors office and it is recommended I be tested and quarantine until results come in.

16 month old low fever.	My son, who is 16 months old, suddenly had a fever last night of about 99, and has stayed at the 99 range all day so far. He’s spent the last few days chewing on his hands and fingers, and I see teeth cutting (his canines), but I’m all wigged out because of everything going on with the pandemic. We live in AZ, so it got really bad out here. Hes acting normal and giving Motrin every six hours brings his temp back down to 97-98, he’s running around and playing, he’s eating, nursing, and drinking his normal amounts of water. My sister got married two weeks ago, so there’s one instance that I broke quarantine (it was a small chapel, five people were there total including myself. All wore masks and distanced.) three days ago, my sisters AC broke and their house temperature was 90 degrees, so we let them come over while they fixed their AC. No one I know has symptoms at all, so I’m assuming (and praying) it’s him teething. My daughter who is now 4 had fevers with every tooth that cut so I’m used to this, just extra cautious due to the pandemic. I	16 month old low fever.

COVID-19: 3-drug combo treatment may be successful	The results of the new multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized trial now appear in the journal The Lancet. The researchers recruited 127 participants between February 10 and March 20, 2020. These participants came from six hospitals in Hong Kong, China, where doctors had tested them for SARS-CoV-2 and obtained positive results. On average, 5 days passed between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment with the drug combination. The team randomly assigned 86 of the participants to a group that received the combination and 41 of the participants to a control group. In the combination group, participants took a combination of “lopinavir 400 \[milligrams (mg)\] and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 \[hours\], ribavirin 400 mg every 12 \[hours\], and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days.” The treatment lasted for 14 days. In the control group, participants took lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours, also for 14 days.

Anyone have sinus thickening or headaches?	Yesterday I had to get a brain MRA and MRI to keep track of 2 chronic conditions. I’ve been waking up with a sore throat and runny nose for prob like a month or two now (assuming allergies because I’ve been sneezing a lot and this is usual for this time of year) and yesterday was no different. The sore throat went away through out the day as it does and the nose just kind of stays runny. Got my results back yesterday and there were a few weird things, one being minimal mucus thickening in pretty much all my sinus’. Now this morning I have very little throat pain that has already gone really but stuffy nose and pressure headache. I’m scared that this is either the start of covid or an unrelated sinus infection. I just don’t want to have any unrelated infections right now in case I do end up with covid, ya know?	Anyone have sinus thickening or headaches?

Help! Symptoms coming back	Originally tested positive July 21st. Been home and off work since. Seemed to have recovered about 95%. Retested because I need a negative test to return to work. Got a negative result on Thursday 8/13 but today woke with temp at 98.9 and currently (3:55pm) 100.5. I’ve got ice packs on me. Yesterday my lower back started hurting and all of a sudden I’m coughing again and nausea. Could this be a relapse? I’m so scared. I don’t want to go through this again. I’ve got to tell work I’m negative but with the return of symptoms I’m afraid they’re going to think I’m lying. Idk that might just be in my head. Help!	Help!

I think I already had it	Can someone please help me at least by explaining to me some of their symptoms. So in January or February, I was extremely sick. Started with a mild cough which eventually turned into a full blown dry cough, stuffy nose and terrible chest pains. I was extremely tired and my body hurt pretty bad for about 2 weeks or so. For people that have tested positive does this sound anything like the symptoms you had? I could be being extremely paranoid but also wouldn’t mind hearing some of your stories.

Immunity and air travel question	I have a question. Tomorrow a relative will be flying to come visit me, and he'll be staying with us. He has had the virus two months ago and fully recovered, and is now presumably immune (just based on assumptions about temporary immunity after recovery). I am wondering if there is still a chance he could transmit the virus to my family if he is exposed again on the airplane. Would a 2 week quarantine be needed, as we would do if he'd never had the virus? Or would changing clothes and showering after the trip be sufficient? (Essentially, does his immunity, assuming it exists, protect us as well if people are contagious around him on the plane?) Thank you.	Immunity and air travel question I have a question.

Cannabis use before, during, or after covid. Tell me your story!	How do guys, Hard to word any kind of post to this sub, weird atmosphere. A great sub to have though, full of information. I’ve a question to those that have or have had covid, and are also regular consumers cannabis. Did you continue smoking/eating throughout showing symptoms? What about after (in the case that you’re experiencing long term effects)? If so, did it feel like it helped or made it worse? I’m not trying to imply cannabis is a cure for covid, because it obviously isn’t, more so if it made you feel worse or helped you deal with symptoms. *im not posting this to be lectured about the pros and cons of cannabis use. This is a Covid sub, so please keep your answers on topic*	Cannabis use before, during, or after covid. Tell me your story! How do guys, Hard to word any kind of post to this sub, weird atmosphere.

Covid ain't got shit on me	Felt a little under the weather and was on a vacation with someone who was in contact with someone who had covid. I decided to get tested and sure enough I tested positive. Typical symptoms including fatigue only lasted a couple of days. Im a 32 year old male who is in good shape so I'm sure that played a major role in my speedy recovery.

Mask wearing vs symptom severity	There have been some studies showing you're likely to get less sick if you were wearing a mask when exposed to the virus. I just wanted to take a quick poll to see if that seems to hold here. Obviously you cant generally know precisely when you were exposed, but just make your best guess.

Reinfecton?	Is it possible to get reinfected again in such a short time period? I had covid the beginning of July and recovered. I just started a new job last week and I just started having a sore throat and chest tightness. It's only been 2 months 😩.	Reinfecton?

Tested positive in March - recently been having extremely exhausting periods...... anyone else experiencing something similar? Know how to fix it?	So I tested positive back in March, had a tough one was in bed for a month and then slowly began doing everything right (food, mental and physical health) to get fit - felt better by mid-July and started thinking the worst was over. But suddenly in August right as my periods began I got SO tired I couldn’t lift my arm, I was exhausted. Was told to pump vitamins in and probiotics (I also had a loose tummy with cramps). Started getting better again but again in September, a well before my period I started getting tired, achy, weak - when they came I was exhausted again, not as badly as August but still, three days of no activity just sleep.

Tested positive for Covid again.	I’m a RN and work in a Detroit area hospital. I tested positive back in April and have since had a few serology tests done which were positive. I had to get swabbed to send my child to daycare because of the type of work I do. I was “inconclusive” last month and I swabbed again last week and I’m positive. No symptoms. 3 months after my first infection my hair started falling out. A weeks worth of hair coming out in a day. It’s slowed down but the diameter of my pony tail is dramatically thinner. I’ve seen many posts about hair loss, and no, it’s not stress related. This is different. It’s almost like a neurotoxin. Doctors I work with can’t explain it. 6 more days of quarantine. A lot of Americans are mingling while I decline outdoor parties with staff. I don’t try to risk it since I live in Canada. Is it possible I was reinfected or is this the dead virus lingering in my nose?	Tested positive for Covid again. I’m a RN and work in a Detroit area hospital.

Weird symptom - SUDDEN intolerance of food while eating	"I'm 12+ weeks in and appetite has been diminished for long time. I've lost 10 lbs and I'm already pretty small to begin with 😅 Lately, when I'm eating a meal, I will SUDDENLY hit a wall, like, zero to 100, in the middle of a bite, like my body decides it is categorically rejecting any more food. I get an intense wave of nausea and become flushed, to the point that I can barely finish chewing the bite that's in my mouth.

I tested positive followed almost immediately by three negatives.. what do I make of this?	Here's the facts: I tested negative on 8/12, positive on 8/24, negative on 8/28, negative on 8/31. Boyfriend who lives with me and sleeps in the same bed and eats what I cook tested negative on 8/26. We did the test on the 31st to make sure my negative on 28th wasn't a false negative. I isolated from him immediately upon seeing the positive result. I wanted to believe the 8/24 had to be a false positive. How do these results make any sense otherwise? However, looking into the test type (nasal swab molecular I think) it seems impossible to get a false positive without a lab error or cross contamination of samples. I just don't understand what it means. The state health official who I contacted after both my boyfriend and I got negatives said hmm that is weird, maybe you resolved your illness within a few days and he didn't get sick. That seems so impossible though because he and I spend almost all hours of the day in direct contact or within 6 feet of each other since we work from home.

Would an inhaler help with shortness of breath?	Trying to get some work done from home and the shortness of breath is driving me mad. It's not too bad, I just feel like no air is going in when I breath and that my throat is closed up. Feels like someone is pressing on my chest. I also sometimes get numb feet and hands. Sometimes I have more shallow breathing, depends of the day I guess. Also have chest pains. 7 weeks from first symptoms and SOB wasn't this bad before.

Mild/asymptomatic tested positive	I tested positive on July 16th. I most likely contracted it anywhere from July 5th - July 13th. After realizing I had close contact with family members that had it and I now most likely had it, I became extremely anxious and depressed. It was literally the worst depression I've ever had that lasted about a month. I tested on July 16th with no symptoms other than fatigue, anxiety, and depression. The doctor gave me hydroxyzine HCl for my anxiety and I started taking it right away. I also started taking vitamin d and c daily, and melatonin before bed. My appetite was terrible and I had to force myself to eat at least a small meal a day. About a week after testing, I started having some gastrointestinal issues (gas and mild diahrea) that lasted about 5 days. During this time, my ears started to feel like they needed to pop (this feeling lasted until a few days ago, and is still a little intermittent). I got my appetite back about a week or two ago.

Post Infection - costochondritis?	To those still experiencing chest pains despite having diagnostics come back clean is it possible the chest tightness being felt is caused by costochondritis.

Angry at myself, me against the world	I am mad. Ever since the virus outbreak I’ve been extremely anal about seeing other people, I quit my job and found one that was fully remote, never went outside, never went to restaurants, nothing. Unfortunately I had to end a long term relationship as well because of covid issues. After heartbreak and a couple of months I decided to go on a date with one person, I asked her if she had covid etc and she said no. Long story short, I have all the symptoms for covid and I got tested. It’s frustrating to see my friends going to bars seeing other friends and I’m shelled up in my home only to get it the only time I decide to let my guard down. It doesn’t help that It took me a year to recover from a concussion and now have nerve damage so I can’t ride my bike which is a huge part of me. I really feel so lonely and depressed that my life might not be the same because of the virus. Help please. thank you for listening to my rant.	Angry at myself, me against the world I am mad.

How long did it take to get your test results back? M19	I went and got tested a couple days ago because I started feeling symptomatic and someone else in my house had been exposed, therefore I was. They said it would take 10-14 days for the results to come back. Since then my symptoms have only gotten worse. I can't say what it is yet, but I suspect it's Covid19. I am incredibly weak and lethargic, I can barely walk unless it's at 1 mile per year or so. Even typing is much slower than normal for me. I also have diarrhea, nausea, a tightness in my chest and throat, and recurring headaches. No fever, or none that I can sense. I'm fairly miserable and I am anxious about what it could be.

21 Year Old SUPER Healthy tested positive today!	I am a very healthy 21 year old male and I tested positive today. I want to emphasize healthy because I workout 6 times a week, I do triathlons, and eat very healthy (I am mentioning this because I think it boost my immune system which has caused very weak symptoms thus far, and maybe others might live a similar lifestyle and are curious). Luckily, I have very easy access to testing and results and I was planning on going out with 4 friends this weekend, but wanted to get tested before hand to play it safe (the only places I have been going out to are a couple of restaurants and the park). Came back positive, current symptoms: feels like morning allergies that I always get. Hopefully stays like this! Writing this up for us younger people that are scared. Although every case is unique and we should take it seriously, statistically speaking a lot of cases are mild so no need to be very paranoid. Stay safe, be healthy, and take responsibility.	21 Year Old SUPER Healthy tested positive today! I am a very healthy 21 year old male and I tested positive today.

I have been presumed positive and am.on week three now. They finally set up a drive up testing site in the area via Quest Diagnostics so I was able to go get tested today - I was denied testing before because I wasn't a healthcare worker or first responder and didn't need to be hospitalized. So I've been isolating alone in my apartment and the isolation and being sick is just making me horribly scared. I'm now on my third wave of whatever this is. I've experienced nausea, diarrhea, headache, sinus congestion, runny nose, chills, chest congestion, a constant almost drowning/wet lung feeling, shortness of breath, a bit of a dry cough, heart palpations, and the latest symptom of dizzy spells. I've been taking Mucinex, Pepto bismul, Tylenol, and an Albuterol inhaler. Melatonin to sleep at night. Klonopin from my therapist when I panic. It's been three weeks and the fact that I keep getting waves and symptoms I thought were gone come back I'm starting to really worry.

They finally set up a drive up testing site in the area via Quest Diagnostics so I was able to go get tested today - I was denied testing before because I wasn't a healthcare worker or first responder and didn't need to be hospitalized. So I've been isolating alone in my apartment and the isolation and being sick is just making me horribly scared. I'm now on my third wave of whatever this is. I've experienced nausea, diarrhea, headache, sinus congestion, runny nose, chills, chest congestion, a constant almost drowning/wet lung feeling, shortness of breath, a bit of a dry cough, heart palpations, and the latest symptom of dizzy spells. I've been taking Mucinex, Pepto bismul, Tylenol, and an Albuterol inhaler. Melatonin to sleep at night. Klonopin from my therapist when I panic. It's been three weeks and the fact that I keep getting waves and symptoms I thought were gone come back I'm	2

Do you guys think it's safe for me to go on a trip in two weeks? (read)	Hey everyone! First I want to start off by saying I take this virus very seriously- a little too seriously- so I am not writing this with ill intent. I'm really just trying to take care of my mental health. Since this has started, like a lot of folks, things really spiraled down for me and I started losing it. I have a severe anxiety disorder, OCD and Hypochondria, so being stuck at home during a pandemic with my high-risk mother and high-risk grandparents is absolutely the most terrifying thing for me. I went back to work recently, and I volunteer on weekends handing out care packages (mask, vitamin C, hand sanitizer, food, water, and clothing) to the homeless people on the NYC streets who don't have access to these things. So I have been exposed to a lot of people without masks, even though I always wear one. I tested and quarantined myself twice out of fear. Headaches, stomach aches etc. The first thought of a symptom and I'm right back on the testing line. Negative both times. Brushed off as anxiety, as always.

Did anybody get tested after 6 or 7 weeks?	"Criteria finally changed and now I'm eligible for testing. I'm convinced I had it and I'm about to fully recover (week 7 starts Friday) but my symptoms are almost resolved. I'm concerned getting a test now (Dr offered) won't show the virus and would give my Dr (who already said he ""personally don't think you have it"") a reason to keep dismissing my symptoms. I'm getting checked due to heart issues right now. Did anybody get a test after so much time has passed and tested positive still? Anybody was/is almost certain they had it and tested negative due to testing so far into the infection (weeks after symptoms first started)? Thanks!"	"Did anybody get tested after 6 or 7 weeks?

WHAT ARE BEST HOME TREATMENTS? DAD HAS COVID-19	My Dad has All Covid-19 symptoms. One of his coworkers tested positive, as soon as he found out he stopped going to work. That was 14 days ago. He has had symptoms for the last 3 days. Highest fever on the 2nd day. Chest pain all throughout. He says steam baths makes him feel better. He does them 3x day. Called a hotline and was told to quarantine. 1. What has been one of the best home treatments to ease your symptoms? He's taking tons of vitamnin C and other vitamins, paracetamol. Also I have been arguing with his wife to take him to the hospital. They don't want to since US hospitals are collapsing and he might get even sicker just waiting. 2. How long does it last? They have the notion of 5 days which I am trying to prove it is longer. Any advice will be helpful thanks.	WHAT ARE BEST HOME TREATMENTS? DAD HAS COVID-19 My Dad has All Covid-19 symptoms.

Is it possible this could have been going on for longer than we know?	"Back in Nov last year me, my son, partner, and daughter all fell ill with ""flu like symptoms"" however this was like nothing we'd ever experienced, we were all floored and had sore throats and a lingering cough for weeks. Both my brother, and my mother who have underlying health issues (asthma/chrons disease) had the same but they got admitted to hospital with pneumonia too. Many people we know also fell ill with the same thing. My sons school was closed for deep cleaning as many of the kids were ill (other schools also closed down for a few days too). Is this possible?"

When did you know that you had it?	At what point did you realize that you really have coronavirus and it wasn’t just your anxiety? What was that first major symptom that you knew wasn’t normal and meant something wasn’t right? When I was younger I got anxious and paranoid about being sick. I couldn’t tell symptoms of my anxiety and actual illness apart. But, the times when I did actually get really sick, I would always have a symptom that I immediately could tell was not normal and was not my anxiety. That actually really helped me overcome my anxiety going forward because it taught me how to better distinguish anxiety and real symptoms of illness. I just share that because I see a lot of people on here unsure if they’re feeling anxiety or if they’re really sick. Hearing from others who had that same feeling and then turned out to actually be sick might help people distinguish between the two.	When did you know that you had it?

Lingering Chest Soreness After COVID?	"Hi all, Hung out with someone who was COVID positive on June 30th and found out a day later. My symptoms started on July 3rd and were mostly just a weird tight feeling in my chest and some tingling/stabby feeling that lasted for about a week (no fever, no body ache, no cough) until the tightness went away and the muscle soreness on my upper-chest/ribcage started. I also now have a small cough (like one or two coughs every few hours) from what feels like spit in my throat that I can actually suppress without pain (thinking this is mostly the chest pain/psychosomatic). The soreness is fleeting, gone/barely there when I wake up but progresses to ""kind of annoying"" as I'm sitting working from home most of the day. I was able to go on a light jog really late last night (to avoid contact with anyone) and didn't cough or get any lung pain, but my ribcage soreness felt a little worse afterwards. Im not sure if the soreness is essentially from just being completely sedentary for 3 weeks while i've been quarantining or if its just muscle damage from COVID that will take a while to heal.

Question About Symptoms	For the past like, maybe week, I’ve had the feeling of tightness in my throat that sometimes moves to my chest, a stuffy nose, and walking up the stairs yesterday left me a little out of breath (granted, I was carrying some heavy stuff, but still). I’m 17, so I can’t get a test without a parent, but my parents are convinced I’m fine and will not take me to be tested. They have no symptoms of COVID, however they are both struggling from allergies, and I have also had my usual allergy symptoms recently too. However, I cannot remember feeling this constant lump/tightness in my throat for so long with my allergies. So, has anyone who’s tested positive felt this tightness/lump in your throat? I can’t tell if it’s my throat tightness that sometimes leaves me with shortness of breath or if it’s that my nose is stuffy. Should I really try to fight back and be tested? I don’t really know what I’d do with my results except panic even more than I already am and of course protect my family if it’s not already too late. Any advice is welcome, and if you read all of this,	Question About Symptoms For the past like, maybe week, I’ve had the feeling of tightness in my throat that sometimes moves to my chest, a stuffy nose, and walking up the stairs yesterday left me a little out of breath (granted, I was carrying some heavy stuff, but still).

A Warning - As a mostly recovered mild case	"Hi all. I see a lot of people in this sub are either ""long haulers"" or are newly infected, but not a lot of mild cases that recovered. I wanted to give some insight as someone who had an extremely mild course of the initial disease, but had a more severe outcome in recovery. First of all, stats 'n stuff: Female, 30, O+, mild asthmatic, obese (now just overweight). I was sick in mid-March, when what was happening then is now repeating itself. I wasn't able to get tested at the time, but I did get tested several times afterward for medical procedures. Now, the first week and a half I was ill, I barely registered it. It was so mild. I didn't have any classic symptoms - no fever, no cough, still had my taste and smell. All I felt was a very light pressure on my chest, and for a few days I was just so randomly tired I felt like I couldn't sleep enough. Just a few days max - but I'd feel like that if I got a night of poor sleep and spent a few days playing catch up, too.

Anyone have any experience or knowledge about Covid with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hypothyroidism?	I’m a 23 (24 next month) year old female with Rheumatoid Arthritis (currently only take naproxen for it, waiting for a specialist) and hypothyroidism (also currently untreated). I also have alopecia which is a mild autoimmune disease but it looks to be in the start of remission. I AM a smoker who had quit for a while but started up again (on and off about 6 years). My immune system is usually pretty good to me, despite my autoimmune diseases. Rarely do get sick and when I do I fight it off pretty hard and fast. Usually sleep for about two days and I’m all better. Covid is terrifying me as I’m scared my immune system would finally over react and kill me.

If you want to drastically improve your odds of survival, do these NOW. (confirmed sufferer)	1. Stop smoking. Now. Seriously what the hell are you doing still smoking?! You're gonna suffer badly if you get it. Believe me, I don't smoke and this shit gets scary. 2. Work out your lungs. 10 times a day breath in and hold for 20 seconds. Once you think your lungs are full, force a bit more air into them. Aim is to stretch them. You will feel dizzy and uncomfortable but stick with it. Seriously, I doubt any free divers are going to succumb to this. 3. Liquids. Forget 2.5 litres a day. Drink 4 litres. A lot of that hot too. 4. Keep up with your vitamins. Especially D. Do your own research but D is essential for the immune system. 5. If you get it, sleep. A lot. Don't over exert yourself. Let your body fight it.

Should I be worried?	I’m going to urgent care tomorrow because I’ve been having chest “pain.” It’s not a sharp pain but just dull. Like someone is lightly pressing on the left/middle of chest. Sometimes it’s more noticeable when I take a deep breath. This has been an issue for me before covid existed. I should have gotten this checked out months ago, I know, but I have a lot on my plate at home and I’m a stressed college student. But I’ve noticed it more now and I’ve started to have shortness of breath. It’ll last for a few minutes. I called a local hospital and a nurse told me to go to check for any underlying issues (scans and bloodwork). As of now I’m young with no previous health issues (that I know of). I don’t have a fever but a cough every now and then. I was sick for about 3 and a half weeks (end of feb./beginning of mar.).

Presumed positive back in March. Now I have a fever and I'm nervous.	Very long post ahead. Just need to vent. 30F here. No current underlying conditions that I'm aware of although I do have a history of bronchitis from when I was younger and I am a former smoker, so that probably counts for something. I tested negative but was presumed positive by my doctor back in March (tested several weeks after onset of symptoms). I had very classic symptoms that lasted for a long time, at least two months (cough, SOB, chest heaviness/tightness/pain, headache, sore throat, GI issues, low grade fever, shaking chills, heart palpitations/elevated BPM, etc.) and some lingered after I felt I had mostly recovered, especially the shortness of breath, chest pain, and elevated heart rate. It's now September and I still don't feel like my breathing has returned to what it was. I was very, very cautious in the beginning not only because I didn't want to infect anyone else but also because I was terrified what I had maybe wasn't covid and then I'd get it and be even sicker. I started letting my guard down around Memorial Day once I started to feel like myself again by interacting with some friends, mostly outside, which led to	Presumed positive back in March.

I tested negative but was presumed positive by my doctor back in March (tested several weeks after onset of symptoms). I had very classic symptoms that lasted for a long time, at least two months (cough, SOB, chest heaviness/tightness/pain, headache, sore throat, GI issues, low grade fever, shaking chills, heart palpitations/elevated BPM, etc.) and some lingered after I felt I had mostly recovered, especially the shortness of breath, chest pain, and elevated heart rate. It's now September and I still don't feel like my breathing has returned to what it was. I was very, very cautious in the beginning not only because I didn't want to infect anyone else but also because I was terrified what I had maybe wasn't covid and then I'd get it and be even sicker. I started letting my guard down around Memorial Day once I started to feel	1

Need to vent about this and don’t know what other subreddit to post on	My dad passed away on July 21st (due to complications from bitch ass COVID) and we haven’t had any type of funeral or memorial service for him and we won’t. I just asked my mom a few minutes ago if we could do a “velacion” (the word in English for this is probably wake but I’m not sure) for him next year when all this bs is over and she said yes. So apart from not being able to visit him in the hospital while he was still alive and not being able to be there for him physically when he died, now this fucking virus won’t even let us have a memorial service/wake for him. And obviously my mom had to choose to cremate him even though we all didn’t want that, but my mom and none of us wanted to risk others getting infected. Apart from all this 2 of my other family members and possibly myself got infected so the stress levels that we’ve all been put through this past month wondering if we were gonna live or die is impossible to describe in words. I already had ptsd, but I think this just added a whole	Need to vent about this and don’t know what other subreddit to post on My dad passed away on July 21st (due to complications from bitch ass COVID) and we haven’t had any type of funeral or memorial service for him and we won’t.

Wondering if anybody here has experienced rashes	For about 2 weeks now if had these full body rashes that have came and went 2 separate occasions. I haven’t been any ware near an allergen or have been eating new foods. The day before each wave of rash occurred I experienced aching, chills in the neck and back, burning eyes, hot skin. And now I’m starting to experience some coughing and nauseousness along with some red streaks appearing around the rashes. My sister and mother have both been exposed to Covid positives at there work places. So I guess my question is, has anyone experienced these rashes?

Advice for Contact Tracers?	Hello all, I am currently finishing a Contact Tracing training program offered through my local college. Would you mind sharing any advice for potential tracers based on your experiences, and would you share what was effective or ineffective? Is there anything that you would like to see changed for better services provided? Thank you so much for your time, and I wish you all a speedy recovery.	Advice for Contact Tracers?

Question about temperature in the early stages of covid!	I’m not sure if this is allowed but I just wanted to get other people’s experiences with the illness. But please delete if not allowed! So my husband had to go to the doctor because he had bad abdominal pain and it turns out it was a kidney stone. He thinks he was very careful but the clinic was seeing covid patients. But then last night and into today he has had a headache. And then this morning after doing dishes he felt flushed and out of breath. That’s when we quarantined him to our bedroom out of an abundance of caution. Anyway he has been taking his temp and it was normal low 98s. Then this evening it jumped to 100 and then 99.5. But now it’s normal again. Anyone else have a fluctuating temp like that in the early stages. Thanks in advance!	Question about temperature in the early stages of covid!

Anyone have very mild symptoms that went away after a fever?	I live with my parents and they've been the only people I've been near for a few weeks. A guy my dad works with tested positive, they are both carpenters and were working building a bathroom together in a cramped space. Both my parents have been coughing but they can't get tested without a fever. Last week I had a dry, sore and swollen throat, burning and crackling in my chest, and exhaustion. Then Friday I got a fever, went to sleep with it and woke up in the middle of the night having sweated it out and all my symptoms were gone. Ever since then and I've been feeling totally fine. I want to be able to help them if they start having trouble and if I have it then I can stop worrying anymore about being near them... These seem so incredibly mild though compared to everything I read.	Anyone have very mild symptoms that went away after a fever?

Does this sound like Covid? (Gastrointestinal issues over a week, loss of appetite). Have no idea whats wrong with me	Hello I was wondering others opinions. 9 days ago I started having IBS like symptoms. I've never had anything like this. After eating or drinking my lower abdomen would be painful (pain lasted 2 days). It will gurgle ,food goes right through me. Burping a lot. I was having bowel movements 4-10 times a day. 5 days ago it started being loose stools. The last three days I went twice, once, twice today so nothing crazy but my stomach does not feel right and still making noises. I have this weird slight hunger like pain after eating or just randomly. I have no appetite, I have to force myself to eat. Today my thighs are very sore. I feel so tired. Peeing often today. I have had a urine &amp; stool test. Blood work taken. Everything comes back normal. I thought originally the stomach issues were from strenious lower ab exercises. However its been 9 days now and I'm stumped. My doctor said it might be ibs. But would it come on so suddenly? And make me so different .. No fever, no coughing, no sore throat.

High blood pressure and COVID	Howdy from Texas, hopefully everyone who is reading this is as well as they can be. My girlfriend was tested on Thursday after her and her coworker were displaying numerous sypmtoms, both actually came back negative yesterday. However, today my gf complained of not being able to taste/smell, fever, headaches, hot and cold body temp issues, and is coughing. So far if I have it I am asymptomatic with the only tiny possible sign being a bit of phlegm in my throat. My question for a medical professional is what is the possible effects on an individual with high BP, if any? Ive heard a lot of conflicting things out there and was hoping someone could enlighten us. My BP is genetically high, I'm 30 and a very healthy individual that works out quite a bit and eats healthy, doesn't smoke and currently active duty military. The only thing I've been taking is 10mg of Lisinophil to start managing it early, also went to cardiologist last year and got a very good report back. Usually I'm high 130s/ low 140s over 80s/90s. Hopefully I'm not breaking rule 4 here lol. Thank you and hope everyone affected starts feeling better!

I'm looking to talk to folks who have tested positive for Covid-19 and what their experience has been like. Ideally would love to talk to North Carolina residents and speak with a wide range of folks who have experienced mild, moderate and severe cases. If anyone would be willing to share their experiences, I'd love to talk more for the article. Feel free to PM if that's more comfortable.

Negative Test	So here’s my story: March 13th-14th: killer headache, low grade fever, feeling generally unwell, but not horrible March 15th: episode of diarrhea, dry cough starts, short of breath after walking upstairs, temp rises to a steady 100.4. Went to a minute clinic and ruled out flu. Mar 16th-17th: extreme fatigue, back and neck aches, fever rises to 102.8 and stays above 101. Breathing becomes worse even just sitting. It feels like bricks are sitting on my chest when lying down. Went to family doctor and was met around back and went through the whole deal to come to the conclusion that the doctor thought I had Covid 19 and she wanted to test me. Told test would take 3-5 days to get results. Mar 18th-22nd: still have high temp ranging from 99-100’s. Breathing is still difficult and end up back at doctor and get prescribed an inhaler. Oxygen at 96% and heart rate was 127, lungs sounded good. Cough is still unproductive and sporadic. Still no results from test. Mar 23-24: start having hours of the day where I felt okay, only to have my fever come back and feel like death again. Still no test results, doctor said it	Negative Test So here’s my story: March 13th-14th: killer headache, low grade fever, feeling generally unwell, but not horrible March 15th: episode of diarrhea, dry cough starts, short of breath after walking upstairs, temp rises to a steady 100.4.

Bad headaches?	I don't have covid-19, but I suffer from frequent, debilitating migraines. Meds often fail me, but it does help to use ice packs on my head. I usually just put ice in a Ziploc bag (best to double bag to prevent leaking). Noticed bad headaches are frequent with covid-19, so I just thought this may help those suffering.	Bad headaches?

GI Issues + extremely rapid heart rate	Hi guys! 26/F, first post. Got my test today- i’ll know if I’m positive by Friday, but the doctor is almost 100% that I have it. I seem to have the gastrointestinal strain of the virus, many symptoms- but the nausea and vomiting are plague me. I haven’t kept anything down in 24 hours. What’s weird is this average resting BPM. I usually have low blood pressure, am in great shape, and have an average resting heart rate of 65-70. Onset of symptoms were Sunday night, during which I averaged 100-110 average BPM. Yesterday it increased, 110-120, and today I’m averaging 120-130. I’ve had terrible respiratory illnesses in my past, so I know what 87% oxygen level feels like. I’m not there yet. I’m just wondering if 125-140 warrants a trip to the ER or not.... I’m feeling strain near my heart and on the left side of my chest, but not it’s not terrible.

To those who had mild cases with lingering symptoms, did you ever talk to a doctor?	I am pretty sure I had covid in March-i was sick with a cough fever and SOB, but wrote it off because my fever was low and only one day. The cough and loss of smell however, lingered for 3 weeks. I’ve had periods since I was sick of a few days of chest discomfort, and my cardio is nowhere near it was before I was sick. I’ve had another period of a few days of chest discomfort (though my O2 is perfect). Would it be worth it to discuss with a doctor?

I made tons of homemade PPE, now it might be contaminated.	As mentioned in my last post, a coworker of mine just tested positive for COVID-19. I spent several days making homemade face masks and putting them in little kits that included some rubber gloves and screen wipes for cellphones along with a little info packet on COVID-19 and sanitation. I was going to hand them out to the homeless and donate the rest. Now that I know I may have covid, what do I do with it all? I would hate to just throw it all away. Is there a time frame where it could sit in my closet that would allow enough time for any virus on it to die, and then hand it safely to someone else who can distribute it? We’re talking 40+ homemade PPE kits.	I made tons of homemade PPE, now it might be contaminated. As mentioned in my last post, a coworker of mine just tested positive for COVID-19.

Trying to stay positive while my mom is on a ventilator.	My mom tested positive for covid 3 weeks ago, she was fine the first week, just congestion, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, etc but she started actually getting worse... no appetite, no smell/taste, completely exhausted and shortness of breath. She ends up going to the ER, we find out that her oxygen sat was only at 76 and she has double pneumonia. She gets admitted and then transferred to a larger hospital with a covid unit. This was 11 days ago. To put a long story short, 3 days ago, they decided to put her on a ventilator to give her body a break because she wasn't improving much. She is currently at 80% oxygen. They did a ct scan of her lungs, and she most likely has air escaping from her lungs. It just seems like we can't get over this hump. She's 64 years old, in good health and is probably considered slightly overweight. I'm looking for positive thoughts and any similar survivor stories. My medical lingo is not great, so apologies if any of that was confusing.	Trying to stay positive while my mom is on a ventilator.

Potentially exposed to Covid today, what are my next steps precautions?	As my title suggests I may have been exposed to COVID today. My friend brought his cousin with us on his hike today. He stupidly didn’t tell us that his sister, who he lives with, got tested for Covid. I hit the same vape pen as he did today. After the hike we got a call from him saying his sister tested positive for COVID. I am currently living with my parents and informed them before I arrived at my house and I have had 0 contact with them. I have already called out of work and informed them on the situation. What should my next steps be? I am waiting for my friend’s cousin to get his results back, hopefully he will get them back shortly. How many days should I wait before getting a test? I know getting tested right away wouldn’t do much. How should i self isolate from my parents? What are symptoms I should be looking out for? What is other advice you would want to give that I haven’t asked for? Thank you!	Potentially exposed to Covid today, what are my next steps precautions?

Random Test Positive	Hey all. 32M no medical problems, pretty active. I'm a healthcare worker and get routine nasal swabs every two weeks. My swab I had performed on 6/24 came back positive on 6/26. Absolutely no symptoms. I had a second swab performed, and it came back the next day positive as well. Still nothing, now 5 days from the initial test except maybe mild fatigue. The exposure was probably around the 20th or 21st presumably? Is it typical for asymptomatic positives to develop symptoms later on? My wife tested negative twice and doesn't have symptoms either, she may get another one this week to confirm. TIA. Scary about the asymptomatic carrier, I never ever would have gotten tested otherwise.	Random Test Positive Hey all. 32M no medical problems, pretty active.

Is this normal post Covid symptoms?	Hi everyone, I had a positive covid test, I had loss of smell and taste, I had pretty severe nose issues, felt like I had the chills, was sleeping like 16 hours a day and then finally fully recovered and I was cleared on July 29th on my birthday. Today is September 6th and sometimes I still feel like I'm out of breath or when I lay down to sleep I am very conscious of my breathing. I woke up the other night completely out of breath. I think I have sleep apnea but nonetheless it still feels odd sometimes during waking hours. I feel like I have doubled down on the gym recently to make up for it but anyways, I know that is a normal post covid symptom. But my 2nd positive covid symptom feels like I always have something stuck in my upper throat or in my nose or something. I feel like i'm constantly clearing my throat.

I tested Postive	Hi guys, so I know how terrifying it is to test postive and what really helped me calm down was seeing how others symptoms progressed so I could monitor mine. Luckily now my husband and I are recovering smoothly so I thought I would share what my experience was like. It was a mild case and we are both so lucky to have pulled through. My husband and I both have asthma so this postive definitely scared me. Here is a list of things that really helped us: - An Oximeter..These are not as expensive as you think and really helps if you are experiencing shortness of breath. I struggle with anxiety and it made the shortness of breath worse. Seeing that I was okay and still in a healthy range really eased the anxiety. Not to mention it will let you know when to go to the hospital. -Vitamins D, C, Zinc, electrolytes and nasal spray. These all helped and thankfully we are making a speedy recovery. -Tylenol - Heat packs for pain Here is also a list of my symptoms and how they progressed. I started showing symptoms on Saturday 27th and am now feeling alot better.

Is there anyone here who’s under 20 and tested positive?	My college has made the decision to have us move on campus in the fall and I’m really anxious about it. About me: 19M, Avid distance runner and do body weight workouts, eat pretty healthy, take vitamins, the whole nine yards. I can say rather confidently that I won’t die from covid. But, I have no idea how long I’ll be out of commission. I can’t afford to have an aggressive flu for 4-6 weeks during the semester. If I do, I’ll just have to drop out and that would more or less ruin my life. Can anyone roughly my age reaffirm me and tell me it’s going to be alright? Or, I’d even be happy with horror stories. I’ve been so anxious my neck hurts for two weeks because of this.	Is there anyone here who’s under 20 and tested positive?

Presumed positive living with VERY high risk family members	Hi everyone! Really hoping for some success stories and words of encouragement. My mom (55F) started showing symptoms this morning. She got tested this afternoon and is presumed positive. My dad (56M) is extremely high risk (uncontrolled type II diabetes (A1C 10.5), hypertension, etc.) I (23F) am here staying with them between leases and feel lucky to be able to be a caretaker to them as I have no current obligations as a recent grad without a job thanks to the pandemic. They live in a 2 bed/2bath home with a “bonus room”. As of this morning, I am residing in the “bonus room” on an air mattress with my dog (not letting anyone else touch her), my dad is staying in the guest room, and my mom is in the master. We all have individual bathrooms and are being vigilant about sanitizing. Is there anything else we can do? My dads underlying conditions put him greatly at risk of succumbing to the virus if he contracts it, so we are looking to be as proactive as possible. Thanks so much :)	Presumed positive living with VERY high risk family members Hi everyone! Really hoping for some success stories and words of encouragement.

No childcare for quarantine	I know any single parent out there has had these concerns with everything going on with the corona virus. I just kind of need to vent some frustrations. One night l let my two kids spend the night with their grandma who watches them while I work. This is a Very rare occurrence because she sees them often enough. The next morning I woke up with fever and body aches and felt horrible. I got tested later that day as I was presumed positive and the nature of my work puts me at risk of contracting it and others at great risk if they were to get it from me. Either way, my mom agreed to watch them until I got my test results back and if I was positive she said she’d watch them until my quarantine was over and I could get a negative test result. I feel horrible because I feel like this is such a burden on her. However with no dad in the picture and no other real support system- I have no other choice. On one hand I know that it’s likely they were exposed already from living with me, but it still seemed	No childcare for quarantine I know any single parent out there has had these concerns with everything going on with the corona virus.

Anyone immunocompromised and can share their experience?	I have a condition called myasthenia gravis which makes my muscles weak and can send me into crisis if my breathing muscles don’t work properly. It hasn’t gotten this bad before though. I take medications to weaken my immune system. I’m just concerned if I get covid19, and experience the shortness of breath that I won’t know when I’m in trouble and need to call for help.

What do you think? Confused about what’s been going on with me - I’ve suspected I could have had COVID and I’m still just not totally better...?	Healthy female, 40. My job involved me being around hundreds of people who have traveled from other states and sometimes other counties about once a week. Much of that time is indoors, sometimes in close quarters. On Feb 2, I started feeling achy, tired, and like I was getting a fever. The next day, same thing but worse. The next day, I felt the same and started coughing. It was strange because with the way my chest felt, it seemed like the cough should have been productive but it wasn’t. I would feel like I needed to clear mucous, but it was such a struggle and the cough would be dry. I took NyQuil and DayQuil which helped some and then got some mucinex which was helpful. I felt so exhausted and out of it. I don’t know what my temp really was because I’ve since learned that the thermometer I had wasn’t working properly. But if I had to guess I would say it was never over 101. My temp normally runs about 97.6-97.8, so as soon as I hit 99 I feel it. I did have some tightness/pain in my chest - I remember it because it’s not	What do you think?

Timeline of symptoms	I woke up yesterday unable to taste or smell. I tested positive today (day 2). Does anyone know if I am in the late or early stages of the illness? I know it varies for everyone but I am curious if anosmia is a early or late stage symptom. I would love to hear others' experiences.

Dry Cough and Clear Phlegm	For 2 days now, my throat has been itchy and i've been having coughs lately. I also seem to have phlegm which i have a hard time spitting out. I was able to spit some out and found that it was clear. I've also been having back pains lately that comes and goes (not sure if pain is just due to my sitting position). Do you guys think i should have myself tested? Or it could be just flu?	Dry Cough and Clear Phlegm For 2 days now, my throat has been itchy and i've been having coughs lately.

How to prepare/Early Symptoms?	After doing basically everything possible to not get coronavirus and being isolated as much as possible since March, unfortunately a family member had to be tested today. She currently has a 103+ fever, sore throat, headache, &amp; burning eyes. Besides that though, she says she’s completely fine. She’s still up and walking around as if she’s not even sick? It’s very odd. After going to the doctor and being tested, we were all told to quarantine until the results come back but told it was most likely covid. To those who have had it: what can my family and I do to prepare ourselves? We were told it’s essentially inevitable that we’ll get it so that there’s no need to isolate her since we’ve all been together (my family and I are close, have movie nights in the living room, etc.) 4/5 of us have asthma and one of us has diabetes as well so I’m trying not to panic but kind of already am at the same time. If anyone has advice on how to prepare ourselves, indicators that we’re getting it, or any tips it would be appreciated!!! Hope everyone’s staying safe &amp; healthy	How to prepare/Early Symptoms?

Afraid to get my hopes up that we made it through this fucking awful virus... but does it seem like we might be OK?	"We were SO careful to not get this virus. Didn't leave the house for months, ordered groceries instead of going to get them ourselves, etc. I went to the doctor ONE time to check out an enlarged lymph node (had it for months and was worried about it) and almost certainly caught it there. I've had symptoms since last Monday... started with a migraine, then serious digestive issues, a fever, etc. So I guess I'm probably on Day 9. I've felt fine for a couple of days now. My wife has had symptoms for about 5 days. She felt really sick on her first day, and had a slight fever, but has been fine since then and just feels like she has a mild cold.

How long after infection can you test for antibodies?	I was tested for antibodies about a week after I fell sick and it was negative but I'm so sure that's what I had. My kids, my husband, my sister.. we were all sick with Covid symptoms. I'm wondering if i tested too early for antibodies? I'm going to test one more time to be sure but didn't know if I was good at 2.5 weeks out or 3? Thanks guys!	How long after infection can you test for antibodies?

Doubted I had it, then got tested positive. Here's how I felt/feel with COVID-19	Hey all So i've been working from home for a month now, and around 2 weeks ago I started to feel really crappy. My lungs got tighter, a lot tighter, my whole body felt achey and i felt tired all the time. I have asthma and i'm used to my lungs getting tighter and then using my inhalers to prevent and relieve it. Well those stopped working. I called my GP and got prescribed antibiotics, as it had a similar feeling to a chest infection, which i've had a few times before. My GP suggested at that point that I have a few Coronavirus Symptoms and should self-isolate for 7 days. I started taking antibiotics and again noticed no difference whatsoever. My partner works in care, and her employer arranged for us to go get tested. Wierdly, she was not allowed to get tested as she has zero symptoms, despite her living in the same house as me. I got tested; for those who don't know, the test (for me, in the UK) was a long swab that goes down to the back of your throat twice, followed by a swap up the nose. 3 days later I got my	Doubted I had it, then got tested positive.

Just Tested Positive, doing ok but a bit anxious	32 Male, fairly good health, been doing a lot of biking recently, former (recent) smoker, and pretty heavy drinker, though I haven't touched any since last Sunday. Was at a bar Friday night with a friend. (We were following social distance guidelines but it turns out a server tested positive the day before we were there) I dont know if that's for sure where I got it, but anyway... Drank with a small group of friends Sunday night and woke up the next day with what I thought was an unusually bad hangover, guess I was wrong. Here's my timeline: 1 (July 13th): Onset of symptoms, body aches, chills, dizziness and lightheadedness, likely exacerbated by previous night's drinking. I threw up once in the afternoon then started feeling better. 2 (July 14th): Headache and general fatigue, hadn't slept well the previous night. By mid afternoon I noticed my sense of smell and taste were completely gone. Went to get tested that afternoon. 3 (July 15th): Feeling pretty much back to normal, except smell and taste still gone. 4 (July 16th): Feeling real good today, smell and taste still gone, but otherwise no issues.

Tested positive again?	Sorry for posting too much ): I have a toddler I need to take care of, I feel like I need to test negative in order to be around my child bc im so scared. I tested positive July 6th after being exposed June 28. I retested the 14th and tested positive again. My doctor said I’m not longer contagious though especially when I stopped showing symptoms and I don’t know what to believe anymore as people say not to come out until I test negative twice. I trusted my doctor and went to see some family. But now I’m so afraid. He even said I’d still come out positive but many people test negative after a week. What do I believe? I’m stressing out and I’ve lost 10 pounds due to my this whole thing. I’m 107 pounds again and feel super unhealthy now.	Tested positive again?

Day 6-8: Dr says there’s some crackling sounds on the right side of his lungs that hasn’t progressed and “might be a sign of an infection or something” Day 8: headache No cough. No temp. Normal BP. Normal oxygen. They can’t give me any indication if this is good or bad. I know we have a long way to go and organ failure could be a problem. But so far it feels better than we expected.	8 days in.

Around March 20th. I had a PCR test within a week-ish which came back negative. However due to my symptoms the dr said I could be positive and I isolated for 2 months (my choice). The symptoms continued into April and May, on and off fever, leg pain, tingling, chest pain. CRP in my blood showed inflammation high at the onset of the illness in March and went down over time with follow ups. D-dimer normal. By far the worst was the leg issues, the sensations would keep me up all night. I've had blood tests, mri, ct scan thru the 2 months. They also tested me for other conditions of which I have absolutely none. My last dr visit showed everything pretty much back to normal at the end of May. My symptoms have all pretty much gone away from the start of June. By far the oddest was the toes. Initially the dr dismissed them as unrelated because in March nobody knew anything.

Low grade fever all day, sore throat.	52F here. Running a low grade fever (99.6) all day and have a scratchy, sore throat, no appetite. The sore throat started overnight, fever came on this morning. I don’t feel too terrible, just uncomfortable &amp; a bit feverish. My sister thinks I’m overreacting, but this is unusual for me - I haven’t run a fever since I had influenza in 2017. Anyone else start off with a low grade fever, scratchy throat? Getting swabbed tomorrow, ugh.	Low grade fever all day, sore throat. 52F here.

Question- please please answer	Guys I really need help. I have a 4 month old at home. A coworker came to me today and told me his roommate was in the hospital and just got tested today and was told today (the same day) that he has covid 19. A few things 1.

My wife and I are both in our third wave of severe symptoms since our first onset in March. I don't know if I have the strength to survive this again, and honestly I'm not sure if I want to anymore.	If this is going to just keep coming in waves like this then I don't know if I want to go on. Every time it flares back up it's like living Hell. The nightmares, the pain, the muscle weakness, the fatigue. Every time I go to bed I feel like I won't wake up again. But of course I do wake up again, all night long, feeling delirious and helpless. The heart goes from pounding to fluttering. Stomach cramps, acid reflux, nausea, sweats, chills, and did I mention pain? And now I'm getting mucus from my chest once again. I had finally gotten past that. Has anyone else had visual disturbances with this? My wife and I close our eyes and see like kaleidoscopes or bubbling lava, it's hard to focus on things properly, and I can't see very well in my periphery. I'd suspect we were being poisoned but we don't often eat the same foods. I'd suspect Carbon Monoxide but we have a very good detector and it's telling us things are fine. If I knew that I was going to get better and have a life again then I would not feel so despondent.

Scared for my parents	Both of my parents are pretty young, my mom being 37 and my dad being 40. I know COVID can have a hard impact on pretty much anyone, but I’m not too scared for my mom as she is in good health and is still young. It’s my dad that I’m worried about. He doesn’t take this seriously and dislikes wearing a mask. He is a bit overweight and I was wondering if that puts him more at risk?

Update to symptom progression	My original post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/fmh6yb/my_symptom_progression/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share I started to feel better, but pretty quickly yesterday things turned. I believe I'm on day 10 now, current symptoms include: Headache (mild), strep feeling in nose, difficulty catching my breath (while sitting), pain at base of skull, heaviness in chest, cough, heart palpitations, increased heart rate, tightness in throat, loss of taste and smell. Temp is 99.6 (normal 96.2). I thought I was heading in the right direction. I'm not sure if my kids are I who are all quarantined together are passing it back and forth (they are asymptomatic), or if I hit another wave.

My partner is presumed positive (unable to be tested) and I’m unsure if I should isolate	Three days ago his symptoms rapidly came on. 103 fever and a consistent cough to now constant cough that has caused him to lose his voice. He hadn’t been out in 5 days since his symptoms began and out area isn’t necessarily considered to have a major outbreak, but the entire metropolitan area is only testing those high risk or hospitalized so who knows how bad it really is. I last saw him exactly two weeks before his symptoms came on and now it’s been 17 days since I last saw him and I have no symptoms. I’ve been staying in just to be safe, but now that it’s been over two weeks and I don’t have any symptoms would it be reasonable to assume that I am safe to go to the grocery store and stop a full on quarantine (still social distancing as anybody should)?

How long does this headache last?	I’m on day 7 now and my headache has been raging on for 4 days now. It’s extreme. The pounding/squeezing has woken me up and caused nausea.

Symptoms question!	I started having right sided chest and back pain 3 days ago with no other symptoms. The pain occurs when I feel breathe or make any suddon movements. I went to the doctor 2 days later and had a chestxray that came back fine, but no COVID test because she didn't think that it was covid. Now, im feeling kinda feverish and have a slight headache. Took my temp and it is 99.6. I know that isn't high, but im not sure what to think because the chest pain is still there. Has anyone had similar symptoms and tested poaitive? I have a job interview Wednesday and another Thursday for a job i really want. But I don't want to spread this if I am positive.	Symptoms question!

Examples of how you knew you lost smell/taste	I’ve seen a lot of posts where people have said they’ve lost their sense of smell and/or taste for a time. If this happened to you can you give some specifics on what it was like for you? Like, how did it occur to you that your smell/taste was gone? Did it come on gradually or all at once and how noticeable was it? Were there things you could still smell/taste? I suppose I’m just curious about what this symptom is like and how quickly after you get it do you connect the dots that something is seriously off versus dismissing it for something minor, like a bland meal?

Took over two weeks for my results, work gave me crap for not coming back to work during it all.	I got tested on the 20th, didn’t get the results back officially till the 1st. I work in a hospital and based all my actions off of what HR, Nurses, and Occupational Health told me. Stay home. Thus, I kept calling into working and communicating everything with my manager. Then, I get a call from the top dog basically accusing me of lying/it shouldn’t take this long. I was taken aback by her attitude towards me. After the phone call I was like “I’m going to be fired over this.”. I tracked down my results after it taking over an hour and being told to call multiple number. It came back negative. I was so scared of being fired/getting attitude for all this that I went in the next day and quit. Plot twist: I get a call from the urgent care I got tested at. They mixed up my lab results with someone who has the same name as me and birthdate. The god damn chances. That’s why it took so long. I was able to get an email and letter stating this.

In need of advice from people who know	Ok I’ll just jump right into this- my brother has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He is in San Francisco and I’m in Arkansas. We are extremely close. I won’t go into our family dynamic and all that, but we are a lot alike and have just had a great relationship- he’s kinda been a bit of a father figure as he is 20-some odd years older than me. He’s very very sick. He’s dying. He can barely communicate. I need to hold him. Hold his hand. Be there. I have the ability to go to him, however I realize the danger of traveling right now, and as well the risk I would be taking. I doubt my brothers husband would want me coming in their home after being on planes and such. What if I were to go to a friends house and got shower and change my clothes and put gloves on and a mask before entering? I’m absolutely losing my mind over this. All I do is cry. I need to see him, but I don’t want to hurt my nephew or brother in law.....i don’t know what else to say.... What do I do?

Anidotal Info from retail stores	This near the SC/NC US border... Last week a customer came in to the hardware store where my son works sneezing.

I noticed the individual was taking his mask off inside and sneezing Into the open. I was sneezing within two hours. I never seen the common cold spread this hard so fast. One of the employees tested positive for covid-19 yesterday. He thought this was weird since the girl he'd been having intercourse with the last few days tested negative.

Should I contact my doctor online? Symptoms keep matching up (F21)	Hi all. I'm 21F who no underlying conditions besides relatively controllable IBS. Since about mid March I had a pretty persistent cough and chills but no fever. Thought it was allergies and took medicine for that. I had some GI symptoms, but because of my IBS, I thought it was nothing out of the ordinary. I moved back home after losing my job in the city and ever since I arrived home I've had pretty persistent lower right back pain. I went to the minute clinic and given antibiotics for a UTI. UTI test came back negative a few days later, but I finished the antibiotics just in case. My cough stopped around the time of the back pain, but came and went with low-grade fevers here and there and pretty persistent chills. Woke up yesterday with dry eye and throat and the cough has come back today. I have felt rattling in my back the entire time and shortness of breath, but I have anxiety and thought it was that. I've also had SUPER vivid and weird dreams, which I've seen other people mention having with the virus. I'm pretty young and not too worried, but wish I could	Should I contact my doctor online?

I am currently always experiencing a lot of anxiety due to my personal life. My mental health isn’t great at all right now. I just walked a small distance to my mail box and came back gasping for air, and feeling light headed and spacey. This is very abnormal for me, I love to walk and be active. I have felt shortness of breath when being active and while just relaxing. My chest feels like there’s a slow burn inside and a large weight on my chest, like someone is sitting on it. I have no fever and my cough is every once in a while. My throat hurts as well and my appetite is dwindling.

Does anyone think they had it early on but tests weren't available yet?	I (29F) work in healthcare, and reading through these threads it sounds like symptoms I had early-mid march. Tachycardia, chest tightness, low grade fever, and fatigue. There might have been more symptoms but I dont remember. Right after that my parents got a similar thing but got over it. But there were only a few (confirmed) cases in my county in Texas. We're a lot of people testing positive at that point? My anxiety is through the roof lately since no one on my town takes it seriously but I'm just being optimistic that I may have already had it 🤷‍♀️	Does anyone think they had it early on but tests weren't available yet?

How mild can symptoms be 2/3 days in to start of symptoms?	For those who have tested positive, did anyone have mild symptoms? I've been congested for a couple of days, with pressure in my head similar to a stress headache. Sometimes I feel the pain throughout my face, but lying down helps. Started having a tickly throat and post nasal drip, but I've had this on and off for weeks. So far no temperature 2 days into the symptoms. Tests are pretty hard to get where I am, and you can only get one!!! SO.. I don't want to waste my test opportunity if it's just a cold. I don't have any of the temperature, or a real cough or loss of smell etc. BUT I don't know if it's worth just using my one test right now, as my family are all pretty high risk.

Friends dad has tested positive	My friends dad, who he lives with, has tested positive for corona virus, and so far so good. It does not look like he will need to be hospitalized. However my friend has something I need to pick up from and I’m wondering if there is any safe way to do this. We were talking about him putting it in the mailbox and my spraying it with Lysol before picking it up with gloves and putting it into a bag. Any advice from someone more knowledgeable would be greatly appreciated.	Friends dad has tested positive My friends dad, who he lives with, has tested positive for corona virus, and so far so good.

Covid toes recovered? Smell and taste recovered?	I’ve had a menthol throat and nose since early February. No big deal, though I sometimes have rough days... I can’t drink caffeine anymore or I get chest pain and exhaustion. But recently my toe has gotten a big numb dry patch on it; got one on my ankle too. Feb 1 is basically when the minty throat and nose started for me, and it is sometimes more noticeable, like when Im tired, and less, when I am out walking in nature, but never completely gone. Sometimes it feels like it could get worse. I’m wondering if any of you have gotten a full recovery from these subtle symptoms. Thank you. Peace Love and health to you!	Covid toes recovered?

They didn't bother taking anyone even to a hospital to try to help them, even though there were beds and respirators available. Sweden saw a chance to get rid of old people and they jumped on it!

Covid or just a cold?	I'm 22. 12 days ago my mother met with the rest of my family. 3 days later it turned out that 3 people are covid positive (they're asymptomatic but they work in medical service and get tested every week). I didn't have an access to a thermometer but I was pretty sure that I've been having a fever since last Thursday. Other symptoms: dry cough, fatigue, sore throat, headache, runny nose, diarrhea and vomiting (only twice in the middle of the night). Apart from that, I have problems with smell (you can spray perfumes next to my nose and I won't feel anything). When I eat food, I can feel the taste but I have the impression that it's weaker...? What do you think? Other family members feel very well but we're self-isolating.	Covid or just a cold?

Worried about facial numbness	Hey all, I tested positive on July 22nd after feeling muscle aches, nausea, brain fog, and low grade fever. For the following week I experienced vomiting, the worst headache I’ve ever experienced, chills, and awful neck tightness and pain. These symptoms have mostly went away but as of a few days ago I’m experiencing new symptoms. A few days ago the left side of my tongue began feeling a little numb and I realized for the first time my sense of taste was fairly dulled. Also, my face has been feeling sorta numb and tingly and some things like blinking, chewing, and moving my jaw around are slightly more difficult. It’s very weird, it feels like I went to the dentist and the novacaine is wearing off. Has anyone else experienced this? At what point do I see a doctor?

Recovery time?	Question for anyone who tested positive or presumed positive, and recovered. Did your symptoms gradually go away or was it more sudden? Anyone who hasn’t recovered have similar symptoms and battle with it for a while? I’ve had somewhat mild symptoms for two weeks now (mainly GI issues, sore throat, dry cough, headaches) Can’t get a test in my state because I’m not at risk (22 M with no underlying conditions) and don’t have a fever or shortness of breath. I also read on this sub about exercise possibly making symptoms worse or flare back up, and wanted to see if anyone experienced the opposite? I’ve been walking on my treadmill for ~40 mins daily which has helped if anything, scared to try anything more intense than that. I know this quite obviously affects everyone differently but having at least somewhat of an idea what to expect helps for sure.	Recovery time?

Tested positive on July 8th, both girlfriend and her daughter both negative	Wondering if I am a false positive while my partner and her daughter both tested negative (July 8th) while I tested positive. We all separated while home and wore masks, used separate baths etc. Partner and daughter tested negative a second time on July 18th. I declined to take a second test and would prefer to have the anti body test. Anyone else in the same boat? I thought for sure they would both get the virus after being in the same house for more than 10 days. How long should I wait for an antibody tests? Also no one showed any symptoms.

Did anyone only experience digestive problems?	Not sure how to flair this because I'm kind of wondering if I have it but am also curious to know if those who did have it, had this presentation instead of the classic one described. For reference, I'm one of those young, healthy, fit, 20somethings. About two weeks ago I had some 'guck' dripping down the back of my throat and a headache between my eyes. I also had a bit of a clear, drippy runny nose... I only coughed a bit one night after staying awake too late in bed watching movies - which tends to happen with any illness I get when I'm overtired - it went away the next day. I also had some digestive... issues. Two weeks later I feel generally fine. I'll admit that I wasn't very good to my body for the past week as I was a bit depressed about the state of things and sat in bed, and probably didn't eat enough for several days. Respiratory stuff is pretty much gone today... however I feel a bit like throwing up... but not enough to actually do so. I've had digestive... problems... all day as well.

What to do about stores not enforcing a mask policy?	This might not be the place to post, but I can’t find anywhere else. So I live Tennessee, a deep red part at that, and many grocery stores and shops have a sign requiring people to wear masks to enter. I walk in, and there’s AT LEAST 10 people I see not wearing one and not a single person gives a damn. Not an employee, customer, no one. Even the local WALMART, who nationwide required masks, doesn’t enforce it. They did on the first day, but I went in to get razors (Walmart is the only place to get Harry’s (shout out to anyone use them) other wise I don’t go in there). I saw at least 20 people not wearing one and not a single Walmart employee said or did anything. Not even at the door. I watched a man walk right past the front door greeter without a mask. What do you about this?? I can’t feel safe to get basic needs because stores don’t even enforce their own policies.	What to do about stores not enforcing a mask policy?

My mom is experiencing heart palpitations and trouble breathing, never tested and released from hospital today without a Covid test.	Just as it says in the title. My mom was released from the hospital today after going in for ongoing heart palpitations, shortness of breath and headaches. To me, it sounds very much like the post-Covid symptoms a lot of people are dealing with. They didn't swab her, but I asked her if she would consider getting an antibody test to see if maybe her symptoms are from having Covid earlier and not knowing. Both my parents have worked with the public in essential jobs since everything began but never had any Covid symptoms or known exposure, so never had any reasons to get tested. The doctors told her it was from wearing a mask at work. Heart palpitations from wearing a mask???? This seems wrong. Can any doctors offer some insight here?

Very very slight sore upper throat, stiff neck, nothing else. [F21]	Hey all! I know this is somewhat of an impossible question, but I’m wondering—did anyone start out / (later) test positive from no visible symptoms but a very slight sore throat?

The upper back of my throat, right by my tonsils, is maybe a LITTLE sore...3/10 on sore throat pain scale, and if I’m distracted, I hardly feel anything. I was dead tired the last two days, but I work long and hard hours and don’t sleep much, so that’s typical for me. I’m really worried I’m sick or getting there, and fearful for my family.

Positioning Advice for Alleviating SOB Symptoms:	Hi, I’m a student nurse, currently only in my fundamentals course but we learned about patient positioning and I’d like to share a position with you all in attempt to alleviate the pressure of your SOB symptoms: It’s called the ORTHOPNEIC or TRIPOD position: - Orthopneic or tripod position places the patients in a sitting position or on the side of the bed with an overbed table in front to lean on and several pillows on the table to rest on. - Patients who are having difficulty breathing are often placed in this position since it allows maximum expansion of the chest. Here are some of the positions you can try: [Over Table](https://is.muni.cz/do/rect/el/estud/lf/js19/osetrovatelske_postupy/web/pages_en/04-lecebne_polohy.html) [Over Chair](https://is.muni.cz/do/rect/el/estud/lf/js19/osetrovatelske_postupy/web/pages_en/04-lecebne_polohy.html) [Leaning Over, Sitting](https://is.muni.cz/do/rect/el/estud/lf/js19/osetrovatelske_postupy/web/pages_en/04-lecebne_polohy.html) [Leaning Over, Sitting, Video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wk1gIsX4GWE) Just a suggestion that I hope may help some of you guys. I’m sure many, if not all, have looked into ways of alleviating this terrible symptom and feeling. Looking up positions for SOB, as well as breathing exercises/techniques for SOB would be beneficial. Rest up, stay hydrated, and be sure to get some nutrients in your body while you’re fighting this! Stay strong.

Both of which are aged ~90, with one of them having a pace maker in addition to recovering from pancreatic cancer after surgery 3-4 years prior. Both grandparents take medication for various issues. My fiance works as a mechanic and therefore in NJ, is deemed essential. I am TERRIFIED he will being it home with him or contract it himself. Obviously in addition to that concern, I'm worried for the safety of the three other individuals in this house if he gets it (which would mean I'd have it too because we share a bedroom). The master bathroom is in his grandparents room (all of which are upstairs) and the only access to other restrooms are through a main hallway. I just don't know what the best course of action is if the worst happens and either he or someone else in the family contract it. Where are we supposed to go???

Hey everybody I tested positive today	I’m nervous more so for my family sake because they’re older and I’m afraid I’ve probably infected then as well. They will be getting tested ASAP but I’m preparing for the worst. I’m a 19 year old male who is overweight but in pretty good condition. I’m nervous and don’t really know what to except. I’ve been dealing with it for a couple days and don’t really have many symptoms right now just mild shortness of breath and mild cough. Does anyone know roughly what I can except?

And when I say it was worst than strep I promise it was. It felt like I swallowed glass and fire! Thursday I woke up and my sore throat vanished like it was never even there and then I had muscle aches hot and cold flashes, slight nausea and belly discomfort and heavy chest..my sinuses suddenly congested it all came on fast and hard. Then today Friday I woke up with all the same symptoms but I couldn’t taste my morning coffee it tasted like water. My sense of smell and taste is 90% gone. I couldn’t smell an onion, sanitizer or even Vick’s when it’s shoved up my nose. So tonight I went in to the ER to get a covid test.

I am the only one wearing a mask in our small office. (IL)	My coworker just came back from quarantining for 14 days after she tested positive. She is still coughing. In fact, 4 of my coworkers randomly cough throughout the day. I have asked to work from home and was denied (I even asked for a vacant office we have and was denied that). Has anyone who has tested positive noticed that they still cough after their 14 day quarantine. Lol this is really frustrating because I simply don’t want to catch COVID, so I’m wearing a mask all day around literally 11 people in a small open office (4 have their own private offices, I am only in a cubicle).

This is terrible.	Found out last Monday someone in my department tested positive after knowingly being around positive family members. Felt fine Wednesday till I got out of my car and started walking into work. Thought I maybe drank a lot of coffee, so I chugged water. Halfway through my shift I felt overwhelmed with fatigue. Head felt hot as hell. Went home early. My dumbass didn’t own a thermometer. When I went to the doctors Friday to get tested I had a 100 temp. Day 2: Felt okay waking up. Throughout the day my body felt fatigued, headache, foggy head, and no appetite. Currently day 6 and still waiting for results. I seem to be getting heart palpitations here and there now, but breathing is fine(luckily). Has anyone else had their symptoms come and go throughout the day? Not a constant issue? Only thing that seems constant is the fever.	This is terrible. Found out last Monday someone in my department tested positive after knowingly being around positive family members.

Had anybody with long lasting symptoms being tested for antinuclear antibodies?	And if so, did you test positive? I got sick at the beginning of March. I wasn’t tested because back then, Florida had very limiting testing criteria. I did have all the common symptoms, including the súper reduced smell (I had to literally touch my coffee with my nose in order to smell it) and very reduced taste, so I was presumed positive. I’ve been having waves of symptoms since then. This one I’m in, was particularly bad and caught me when I was already counting my victory. Luckily, my cardiac symptoms have stopped. They were super scary. My doctor ordered a bunch of autoimmune tests and I tested negative to all but the ANA came back low negative. Have you also been tested? If so, what was yours result? Thanks.

Burning nose, burning tongue?	Last week i was extremely sleepy... fatigue for about 2 days. Never any fever. Sunday i felt like I couldn’t taste my breakfast. Couldn’t eat. I could taste and smell my monster energy drink though. Upper back pain (which is kinda normal for me)... I still haven’t ran any fever. Today I’ve been experiencing a dry nose/tongue sensation like both are burnt. Also super dry mouth... weird. Otherwise my fatigue is gone, i have no cough or shortness of breath, it’s just this weird burnt nose and burnt tongue feeling. It’s really humid in TX and rained like a mofo yesterday, not sure why my tongue and nose are dry AF. Is this a symptom? I searched but nothing sounded like what I’ve experienced.

For all the people on here with pulse oximeters, what is your NORMAL O2 level?	Just got curious as I lost my old oximeter, and just ordered a new one. This one seems to read lower than the old one. Where before I'd normally be 97 maybe 30% of the time, 98 60% of the time and 99 10% of the time, with this new one it seems to be showing 95 20% of the time, 96 30% of the time, 97 40% of the time, and 98 10% of the time. It's lower for my girlfriend too so I know it isn't just my O2 suddenly being lower lol. Anyways. What does your oximeter show the majority of the time?

Anyone have mild symptoms first week and then get worse the second week?	My test is pending. My daughter and I have been sick for a week but it’s been relatively mild (low fever, mild cough, body aches, fatigue). She has chronic allergies and has a cough that comes and goes from her allergies which makes it harder to tell how it’s effecting her but last night she started wheezing. I gave her a rescue inhaler which helped but she woke up 3x in the night with nausea and body aches. I woke up this morning feeling much worse too—very dizzy, diarrhea and nausea and just very tired. Our fevers are still around 100. Wondering if anyone was relatively mild and then took a turn on week two?	Anyone have mild symptoms first week and then get worse the second week? My test is pending.

3 mile walks giving me fevers -_- ~90 days out	I never got tested but had mild symptoms for six weeks back in April/May. A month ago I went on 6 mile walks with my mom for several days in a row, and for a few days after had a high heart rate. I basically mainlined potassium and then I was fine. 10 days ago I start going on 3 mile walks. I did that a few days in a row, and then got a mild fever (and inflamed nostrils) for several days. Then I was totally fine for four days. Yesterday and the day before, I go on 3 mile walks. Today the mild fever is back -_- I did go to the ENT a few days ago, when my fever had subsided, and he said I had a nostril infection. I’ve been on antibiotics and the fever still came back, so I’m wondering if it’s a weird post-viral issue. Anyone else experience this so far out from initial symptoms?	3 mile walks giving me fevers -_- ~90 days out I never got tested but had mild symptoms for six weeks back in April/May.

Tested positive - Still having flare ups or symptoms since February?!?!	31F normal weight First symptom was in mid-end February Fever, neck pain, brain fog, headaches, speech (stutter and can’t find the right words), SOB. Didn’t know I had Covid went to the neurologist did Mri of brain and cervicle spine and sleep studies and sooo many blood work all normal! I thought I was have a stroke. THOUGHT I was over it but 2nd wave came same symptoms a little less intense. No doctors could help. Then 3rd wave in April came went to the urgent care tested positive for covid 2 months after first symptom. May- 4th wave again symptoms less intense besides the SOB. NOW CURRENTLY in my 5th wave and neck pain and speech have relapsed, again better than the initial onset of symptoms. WHENNNN WILL THIS END? Ah I’m so frustrated. I just want to feel back to normal. The speech is the part that bothers me the most. I must also include I and SOOOO TIRED AND CANT SEEM TO SHAKE IT no matter how much I sleep. Anyone, have something to say about this ?

6 months after getting Covid still can’t taste or smell.	Hello! I contracted Covid while working at a memory loss senior living facility in New York State in April. After about eight days I felt fine and then 14 days later I came out of my room but the one thing that never went back to normal with my ability to taste or smell. After about five months I started to be able to smell certain things but the only issue is gasoline and a very potent handcream has the same scent to me. Back in April I unknowingly infected my father, mother, cousin and sister who all live with me, my sister had no symptoms whatsoever and we only found out that she was positive when she took a antibody test a month later and my cousin only lost his sense of smell for two days my mother and father both got theirs back about 2 to 3 weeks after testing positive. My sense of smell and taste left two days after feeling symptoms of fever and excruciating headache but at this point I’m just miserable not being able to smell or taste the food that I make, when I go out to restaurants it’s not even enjoyable, I	6 months after getting Covid still can’t taste or smell.

Covid 19 positive? Idk yet	Alrighty, hows it going every one. I got a couple questions to those who have tested positive. First let me start off by giving you all a little bit about my situation. On Sunday 7/5/20, in the evening I got a fever, the fever lasted around 2-3hrs and then it was gone. I doubt this made a difference but I’ll mention it anyway , I am vitamin D deficient so I took my vitamin D and my warm water with lime, which I take mostly every day. I started sweating and then like I had mention 2-3hrs later no more fever. I’ve been in isolation since, to be on the safe side. I haven’t gotten a fever, cough , phlegm,nor congestion, but every now and then I do get a little tired and take deep breaths, but that’s about it. I took my test on Tuesday 7/7/20 which I hope comes back negative. Alright so are the symptoms bad the first couple of days for every one? Should I expect them to get worse if I’m positive? Can I workout, do cardio or body workouts? Since I don’t feel much, if I’m positive, when should I go retest myself? I’m	Covid 19 positive? Idk yet Alrighty, hows it going every one.

I’m so confused and upset.	I tested presumptive positive for COVID on April 3rd via a PCR nasopharyngeal swab. I’ve exhibited almost every symptom of the virus and even stayed the night in my hospital’s COVID unit in mid-April. On May 12th and 18th I retested negative for the virus even though I’m still experiencing symptoms. My doctor ordered the Abbott IgG antibody test (not the rapid test), and I got my results yesterday: negative for antibodies. My result was 0.1, and to be considered positive a result of 1.4 is necessary. My doctor doesn’t know if 1) my initial PCR test was a false positive, 2) I do have the virus and haven’t made antibodies, or 3) the antibody test is incorrect. I feel so confused and upset. What if I don’t have COVID? What if I do and my body isn’t fighting back? I’m truly at a loss and don’t know what to do.	I’m so confused and upset.

Honestly a nervous question	21/ M/ Alabama I was curious to know if I’m honestly just having allergies messing with me right now. I’m experiencing a lot of draining that is going to my throat and making it ticklish and covered with mucus which makes me cough rarely. I honestly get rid of it by clearing my throat. It’s been like this for I’d say 8-9 days. I feel fine besides that, no pains, no lung issues, just the drainage and the throat. I apologize if this is a dumb question. I’m just really paranoid right now.	Honestly a nervous question 21/ M/ Alabama I was curious to know if I’m honestly just having allergies messing with me right now.

Moderate case with week long shortness of breath, worried about my health	Normal blood oxygen and no fever Everyone kept telling me it's something else or I'll recover in a few days. I ordered a labcorp test yesterday but it's the weekend so it hasn't moved. I'm 20 and at 5'9 and 270ish pounds rather obese(Working on it, gained all of it this year coping with protracted benzo withdrawal) and I just wanna feel safe that I'll fully recover and survive. But this shit can change at the drop of a hat. As I said my shortness of breath is only moderate(ex: 2-4 Deep breaths after a gulp of water). I yawn CONSTANTLY and need a entire lungfull deep breath every 5 or so minutes. Should I maybe visit the ER? I am poor so ambulance there and uber back would be my only option if I gotta go.

I do not feel feverish, I just have a headache and my fever has not changed for 4 days. I feel fine for the most part and have a good amount of energy.

Anyone have increased allergy attacks/asthma symptoms?	I’ve been feeling sick with thankfully mild Covid symptoms for about five weeks now. Most notable has been extreme exhaustion that is slowly getting better, but lately I’ve had a few puzzling symptoms that have me confused. I have not have a Covid test, but whatever I have my SO that I live with seems to have had it too (he thankfully seems to be over it for the most part, he had some symptoms parallel to mine but in some ways different so idk). Neither of us have had any chest symptoms up until I have had what I listed below this week. I’m highly allergic to dust, and whenever I get an allergy attack it causes pretty severe symptoms. My heart rate jumps way up, my chest and throat get tight and I get short of breath, I start having to almost compulsively constantly clear my throat and cough, I get lightheaded, my sinuses instantly stuff up, and I have crazy bad post-nasal drip come out of nowhere. Claritin usually makes it stop as soon as it kicks in if I take it right away, but I’ve been trying to get better about remembering to take it every	Anyone have increased allergy attacks/asthma symptoms?

Mild symptoms, presumed positive - isolation question	Hope everyone is doing as well as they can be! I spoke with a doctor this morning and I'm presumed positive. They're conserving tests in my area as I live in one of the 'hot spot' cities in Southern California, but based on symptoms the doc believes I have a mild case. My symptoms are on and off low grade fever, headache, slight sore throat and intermittent dry cough. Initially I thought it was just hay fever/allergies gone awry, but my temp got as high as 99.8 (I run about 98.3 normally) and that's when I doubted it was that. If this is truly it, then I'm one of the very lucky ones. I just hope it doesn't get worse. To be honest, I'm on the fence as to whether or not I think I really have it since my symptoms are so mild compared to others I've known, but I'm all for erring on the side of caution. One thing I forgot to ask, how long should I isolate in my room? I think I read somewhere that I should continue total isolation until I'm asymptomatic for at least 3 days. What has been your guys' experience? How long	Mild symptoms, presumed positive - isolation question Hope everyone is doing as well as they can be!

Tested positive, later tested negative. Went through the disease. I'm ok. I took part in a study to help find a cure. Besides the 20 vials of blood the phlebotomist took they also took a spit sample. Why the spit sample?	Also, they asked if I'm a smoker, how does this impact things? I rarely smoke but two days before the sample, and the day before I had scheduled the sample, I'd smoked a cigar. I rarely smoke but under the stress of recent events I'd decided to have one. A decent sized cigar but not some crazy thing. I told them I occasionally smoke cigars when signing up for the test when they asked if I smoked but they didn't get back to me for over a week. Figured they didn't need me so I didn't think it was an issue. Wasn't sure if the spit test had anything to do with it and wasn't sure if my smoking a cigar less than 48 hours before would impact their research.	Tested positive, later tested negative.

Healing/retracing	Does anyone feel like the recovery is some sort of reverse order of the illness? Like I’m getting old symptoms that I got in the beginning.

Taste and Smell	Hey all, sorry if this been asked. But for those who lost tase and smell, was it complete loss of both or just 1? Woke up this morning and stuff doesn't taste as pungent as it should if that makes sense, like there's a mild blandness. But I can smell like hand soap. Also how long did other symptoms develop after that if any?	Taste and Smell Hey all, sorry if this been asked. But for those who lost tase and smell, was it complete loss of both or just 1?

Anxiety and longer term covid sufferers	Friends who are suffering post-4 weeks persistent symptoms: how are you managing your anxiety, and how does it interact with/overlap your covid symptoms? I'm about 7 weeks in, presumed positive by several doctors but untested. Never had severe symptoms, but persistent lung tightness/soreness, sob, fatigue and in particular an inability to exert myself even slightly without relapsing. I've suffered anxiety though this, and I've always had slight health anxiety. My worst moments with this involved me gasping for breath and assuming the worst, almost calling an ambulance. I now realise this was my first ever panic attack. I've been prescribed short term anti-anxiety meds and it's interesting to note how anxiety affects my covid symptoms. The lung tightness/soreness remains, but my breathing is much less of an issue when I take the meds, and I feel less shaky and therefore less ill, basically. I've also noted a slight correlation between obsessing about covid news and the worsening of my symptoms. In particular worrying about whether this is going to be a long term or permanent condition. It's not all anxiety, it's not all in our heads, absolutely not, but for me, it definitely makes it worse.

Post quarantine, supposed to start a new job tomorrow, sudden symptom flare up.	"Hi all. It's day 26. I had a negative test, but the doctor presumed me positive. Whole gamut of symptoms, though never a fever or cough. Racing heart, low oxygen, sore throat, headache, severe fatigue, body aches, brain fog, diarrhea, chest pain. Last week, doc told me that since I had been feeling better, symptoms had decreased, and the only lingering thing consistency was the fatigue, that I could rejoin society, and to just watch out for Post Viral Fatigue. Felt like it was one step forward, one step back, where somedays I slept all day and others I could go for a walk or paint or do housework, but last week I managed to cook dinner most nights, compared to the first three weeks of total misery, so I figured I was on the up and up.

My dad was admitted for pneumonia. Make me feel better	He is 60, obese with HTN. All of us tested positive for covid a week ago. His oxygen kept dropping at home (and his fever was 103), so we took him to the hospital 3 times. On his trip last night they found pneumonia on both his lungs but still sent him home with nothing (they didn’t even give him oxygen and send him with the same antibiotics he finished a couple of days ago; blew my fucking mind). Hours after we was discharged, we had to call 911 because he couldn’t even walk and his oxygen was so low. This time, the doctor said he needs to be admitted because he’s not doing too well. His oxygen levels are mid to high 80s. He’s on oxygen now. Please Tell me he’s going to be fine.	My dad was admitted for pneumonia. Make me feel better He is 60, obese with HTN.

Exposed flight attendant - developing symptoms	Hey there. I am new here. I am a flight attendant at a major airline and live in NYC in a particularly hard-hit area. I just finished a 3-day trip that I worked very close with 4 others. At one of the airports, there were COVID tests and antibody tests being given to staff, so I decided to take one. I had been sick in April and was expecting to find antibodies. Negative. I just found out what one of the co workers that I went to get tested with had a positive test result for COVID-19. We worked in very close quarters and I had dinner with her with my mask off at one point. I seriously feel like a fool. On the second day of our trip, I had an upper-body rash. It came on suddenly and went away. It seemed odd. We met 4 days ago at this point, and today (before finding out her results) I developed a sore throat on one side. My sense of smell seems to be fading. I have a diffuser on now and unless I’m close, I can’t smell it. I tested negative for COVID-19 and the serology (antibody) test.

Avoiding Spread	My mom recently tested positive and she would rarely leave the house, we’re wondering if it was because of a postmates delivery, or from grocery runs.

Tested positive and have the symptoms. Fiancee tested negative and no symptoms...how.	So I tested positive after being exposed Saturday september 26. Fiancée and I live together. She was exposed same time as me, we got tested twice same time, we live together, and have been together every single moment since both being exposed. She tested negative on the same day I tested positive. She has no symptoms really, while I’ve had the usual (fever, sinuses, can’t smell/test, etc). Basically people have recommended she stay with family or we isolate from each other, but that’s not really doable since we’ve exchanged fluids and lived together this entire time I’ve been sick and showing symptoms. In my mind, she either has it and will show symptoms in a few days, or she has some kind of super immunity. It honestly makes no senses to me. Has anyone ever experienced something similar?

Covid or a mild cold?	For 4 days now I have had post nasal drip and a slight sore throat that really barely hurts. I also have a little bit of a runny nose.

I haven’t had any other symptoms, normal temperature etc, and have had no problem exercising. Has anyone experienced this and should I get tested?	Covid or a mild cold?

Tested Positive Today - Kind of in Shock	32 male, have 1 preexisting condition that is controlled with a medication. I was tested on Friday and was told results would take 4-7. I knew when I got the call today that it couldn't be good. I was informed I tested positive. I'm in shock because I was taking it seriously and taking precautions and do not know anyone else who has had it. I can't for sure tell but I'm assuming I got it at work. A lot of my coworkers do not take mask wearing or social distancing seriously and just last week someone made fun of me for wearing my mask at my desk. My symptoms I guess started Friday (same day I was tested), but I had a weird episode last Wednesday night where out of nowhere I felt like I was drunk. Extreme dizziness and vomiting and just felt completely out of it. I woke up Thursday feeling normal and even did a cardio workout Thursday afternoon. I woke up Friday with a sore throat, congestion, fatigue, and felt warm but I wasn't running a fever. I suffer from chronic allergic rhinitis but something felt different so I got tested Friday afternoon.

Question regarding Symptoms	So the past two days I’ve been having a sore throat and some post nasal drip. Sore throat feels like I was yelling too much at a football game, not a typical sick feeling but more of a scratchy feeling. I had a headache off an one for the day. Other then that I feel fine and am not fatigued or anything. Temp is around 99.2 but it’s been around 98.5 all day back and forth. Does this sound standard with Covid? Thanks.	Question regarding Symptoms So the past two days I’ve been having a sore throat and some post nasal drip. Sore throat feels like I was yelling too much at a football game, not a typical sick feeling but more of a scratchy feeling. I had a headache off an one for the day. Other then that I feel fine and am not fatigued or anything. Temp is around 99.2 but it’s been around 98.5 all day back and forth. Does this sound standard with Covid? Thanks.	0

my covid experience	Seeing a lot of posts about experiences with COVID...decided to post mine. My entire family got the virus due to an extremely reckless family member (my uncle) who decided to take a Postmates job at the height of the pandemic. This family member visited us only to sleep and shower. My parents were generous enough to offer him our home. He infected my grandmother first. She started showing symptoms (fever, chest pains, cough). Keep in mind she is an 85 year old with a pacemaker and soooo many health issues. She has had open heart surgery two times, and several other surgeries. At first, we thought it was just a cold, or she was manifesting stress physically (the whole pandemic has left us on edge). The symptoms went on for two days, so we started getting worried. I had to start sleeping in the living room since her and I share a room. She was quarantined in our room, and my mom (50) would bring her food and medicine with a mask on. Later, my mom started feeling sick as well. Then, my dad (58). Then...me! (17) Apparently, my uncle didn’t tell us he had symptoms, which was the shittiest	my covid experience Seeing a lot of posts about experiences with COVID...decided to post mine.

Any other ventilator survivors having nightmares?	I got home on May 1 after a 20 day hospital stay that included 9 on a ventilator. Physically I'm feeling better every day. Mentally I'm dealing with a bout of depression that I believe I'll work through. However, I've been dealing with nightmares, where I'm either back in the hospital or suffocating in my own bed. Sometimes I wake up (in the real world) panicking and reaching to take the ventilator out of me, when it's not there. This is probably a longshot, because I'm not sure how many vent survivors are here, but I just wanna know if this is common or if I have a problem.	Any other ventilator survivors having nightmares?

Just got diagnosed with pneumonia today, need words of encouragement	Thought I was getting better, but the breathing is still difficult. Went to urgent care for some Xrays where they found pneumonia in both my lungs. I’m crying and I’m so scared. They’re not sending me to the hospital but said to keep watch of my O2 if it drops below 95 (it’s been close). I really need some words of encouragement. My fever has been down but when I heard of the pneumonia I just started breaking down in my brothers car. This is the toughest thing I’ve ever dealt with and I’m a typically healthy 29 year old male. Please, someone just share good news......	Just got diagnosed with pneumonia today, need words of encouragement Thought I was getting better, but the breathing is still difficult.

What do you call your Day 1 of symptoms?	Pretty sure I've got it and just discovered the sub. Thanks for all those who have tracked symptoms! I'm thinking of trying to do the same, but I'm still fairly early on. This past Saturday I had some ear pain (they are sensitive to pressure changes) and post-nasal drip that made me think I had a head cold coming on. Felt great Sunday and most of Monday, and then Monday night hit by a wave of fatigue. Woke up Tuesday with fatigue and non-productive hacking cough and loss of appetite. For the symptom log, should I say Day 1 was Saturday or Monday night? Thanks for your input. I hope everyone makes it through as comfortably and easily as possible.

Terrified that my coworker may have exposed me	Hi everyone, I'm sorry if we see these kinds of posts every day, but I'm kind of freaking out. On Sunday, my coworker and I had to go into the office to host a webinar. Against all better judgement, we did not practice social distancing (we had to monitor each other's screens closely) and were not wearing masks. We were sitting side by side, and I was careful about washing/sanitizing my hands after touching anything. He was not coughing, sneezing, etc. He told me today (Thursday) that he was feeling sick - mild fever (100.2 F), fatigue, and sore throat. No respiratory symptoms. He said they started on Monday. He doesn't think he has COVID-19 (I'm sure nobody wants to assume they do), and he worked insane hours last week (80+), so I'm wondering if it's due to exhaustion? I have not felt any differently, but I know symptoms can take a while to present (if at all). He took an antibody test (negative), but I know antibodies may not have been present yet. He is taking a nasal swab tomorrow, and he said he'd have the results within an hour and let me know what the results are.

Unusual readings after recovery?	So I am on day 27 now showing first symptom (two loose motion instances) on Day 1. Tested COVID-19 positive. All symptoms were typical and mild but no breathing issues. Fever for over a week was 99-101F. Male 60. Blood group O+. Seems like I have now almost fully recovered from day 15 onwards. I feel pretty normal too. However, my temperature for the past 7 days has been sub-normal (95.5 to 97 F). Also, my BP, which used to be around 125/85 most times reads 20 to 25 points lower. For example, day 25 reading was around 95/60. The pulse seems normal, in the 70s generally but the other day, it was 90 (which is high for me). I feel fine otherwise. Has anyone experienced subnormal temperatures and lower BP readings, while generally feeling ok? What do you make of it?	Unusual readings after recovery?

Question about quarantining	I tested positive around five days ago and I’ve been quarantine since. I’m young and I live with my parents, and they just got their results back today and learned that they also have tested positive.

My boss wants me to return to work while I still live with a positive family member	I posted a few days ago about my sister here. Surprisingly I am negative with covid and I still feel fine. But she is still sick, and I still want to quarantine obviously. I let my work know I tested negative and now they want me to come back as soon as tomorrow. I told them I still come in contact with a tested positive family member every day and they still want me back. They assured me that legally I am allowed to come back and that if I wanted to stay home I could lose my job. My boss is contacting corporate now to see what they/we can do. Everything I've looked at online suggests I need to quarantine for 14 days after living with a positive family member, even if I am negative. Is it really legal to return to work if my boss tells me to? I'm confused about my options and don't want to endanger my co-workers. EDIT: and I know they are eager to get me or anyone else who requires some time off to get back in as soon as possible. We are very understaffed especially for my job.

My COVID-19 experience, sick for 2 months, ICU for 3 days, 19 years old, no underlying condition.	Hey, I’m a 19 year old male, studying to become a neurosurgeon. I viewed COVID-19 with a skeptical eye. Thought it was just an overreaction, something killing only older and sick people. So nothing to worry about, that was until I got it. **Week 1** I’m not certain where from I got it. I live in Stockholm and got it in May, which was arguably the worst month as of yet. It started slowly, I felt feverish and a bit tired when I woke up one day, it continued for a few days until I went to get tested and got it back a day later and said I was COVID-positive. I didn’t think much of it, that it would only last a week, and that I’d just self quarantine until then. **Week 2-3** A week had gone since I tested positive, I felt a bit better and on the right trick. I was able of doing moderate exercise in my small apartment, and doing some chores, and work. Second week, I felt even better and thought I’d be completely symptom-free in just a few days. But the days turned longer, and the nights even longer. It started slowly, my	My COVID-19 experience, sick for 2 months, ICU for 3 days, 19 years old, no underlying condition.

Question about flu/other viruses compared to COVID 19	Can the regular flu or other common respiratory illnesses cause a complete loss of smell/taste in the absence of any nasal congestion? Is it also possible for other illnesses to cause shortness of breath like when you have to get up to go to the bathroom you feel like you are climbing Mt. Everest? Both my mom and my wife had the loss of smell/taste smell and my dad had the respiratory symptoms that he described in addition to various other flu or Covid like symptoms such as dry coughs, fatigue, lower back pain, bad headaches, etc. My parents got an illness in late January in Seattle that had all these symptoms.

Could this have been covid?	So my husband broke his back in April and spent 4 days in the hospital after having surgery. About 4-5 days after he got back I started feeling funny (lack of energy, every now and then I would get this wave of feeling like my blood pressure/sugar was dropping and I'd feel sick and have to sit down). This lasted a few weeks until all of a sudden I just couldn't get out of bed. Anytime I would move my heartrate would skyrocket, my muscles were weak and I just couldn't function right. I went to the ER 3 times in 2 months for these symptoms. My bloodwork was a little off but they kept telling me I was fine. They finally tested me for covid in early July and it was negative. Got an antibody test in late August and that was also negative. And while I've started feeling better the last month ( I was totally bedridden for 2 months) I'm still having random heartrate episodes that will land me in the hospital and I'm still insanely fatigued and just dont feel 100% yet.

Kids all have a low grade fever that won’t go away	We have three kiddos who started school about three weeks ago. Over Labor Day, all three have come down with a fever (99-100). It’s stayed pretty steady for the past 5 days. They all have a slight runny nose, and the oldest (8) has a bit of a cough. They’re all as crazy and energetic as ever, and my husband and I haven’t experienced more than a sneeze here or there. To those who have young family who have tested positive, does this sound familiar? If the fever isn’t broken tomorrow, I’m very tempted to get at least the coughy one tested (if he’s pos, the rest are likely positive too. It’s a rather small house). They’ve all been home from school since the fever started and haven’t been back since. No confirmed cases at their school yet.

Anyone have any hopeful stories of Covid-19 that were able to recover quickly?	I was tested yesterday (June 13) and am awaiting results that will hopefully come in by tomorrow. I’ve had a 99.8-100.7 degree fever at night for the past whole week, but only at night. I’ve got headaches, body aches, severe nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, and a very slight shortness of breath that only shows up with the nightly fever. I have AWFUL night sweats and wake up drenched and feeling like I’m gonna puke. Has anyone experienced these symptoms like this and recovered quickly? Basically, I have so much anxiety right now reading other peoples’ posts. I’m 24F, I vape, I got swine flu back when that was a thing, and I have a weak heart due to something near anorexia for a long time. Nothing EVER works in my favor medically speaking. I’m just hoping someone can reassure me that their case wasn’t too bad or too long and help me get some sleep.	Anyone have any hopeful stories of Covid-19 that were able to recover quickly?

Any relief for muscle aches?	My partner is waiting for his COVID test to come back but we are sure he has it. He’s never sick and last night was hit like a ton of bricks out of no where with a sudden fever, headache and chills. He’s been bedridden all day and is in SO much pain from the body aches. He literally yells every time he moves. Any advice for him? he can barely sit up to drink water or use the bathroom. His Dr has him on ibuprofen 800 for the fever and gave him an anti anxiety to help him sleep. Is this combo helpful or is there something better? Sorry for all the questions I’m worried.

I’ve been staying at home quarantined since March 8 in NJ when everyone was still claiming “just a flu.” I haven’t gone anywhere or eaten out, but I have had family members go food shopping.

I don’t know whether or not I should be worried about the virus considering I have no gone anywhere in a month? I can’t get tested due to a waitlist.

Does anyone know if i can get a presumed positive for covid via telemedicine?	I’ve always seen on the news that getting a covid test was easy but it never really mattered to me since I was not sick at the time. Now, however, I am. Including my three children. Pretty mild to moderate symptoms but I'm not sure if it's covid since finding a place to test with available slots is near impossible. My drs office had opening but unfortunately, I couldn’t bring my kids inside. Can’t leave them in the car and I can’t leave them with a sitter while they are sick so obviously I couldn’t take the appointment. My husband is still forced to work because he himself is not showing any symptoms and cannot afford to just take time off to quarantine. His job will only pay him if he or one of us in the household tests positive. Without a positive from one of us in our household, he could potentially spreading it at his job. He works at a prison here in our state and is around inmates and his coworkers all day for about 10 hours a day with little opportunity to social distance. I’m not sure what to do.

Tested positive today, really scared	I have felt healthy every day, and I was going to move in with my parents who are in their late 50’s.

Live with 2 people, one of which is immuno-compromised. Both my roommates have fevers and feel sick. I just need some words of encouragement right now. Feeling guilty that I’m healthy.

Did you take diflucan to cute the yeast infection and did it work? Or did it persist due to the virus? Thanks so much!	Women who tested positive: did you get yeast infections early on?

Was COVID the cause of tachycardia?	In mid-January I became really ill - I had intense all-over body aches, a high fever, and the next day I developed a mostly dry cough. I felt that way for at least a week. During that time I suddenly got tachycardia and palpitations. I would be waking up in the night with a really high heart rate. I ended up visiting the doctor who told me I had a bacterial chest infection (I didn’t agree). I ended up at hospital on several occasions with the tachycardia and went through several tests - all of which came back as normal, just tachycardia. I haven’t had a COVID test so don’t know if I had it, but based on my symptoms and the symptoms of others it seems like I may have? Even now, I still get days where my heart races doing ANYTHING and it’s quite distressing. FYI, I’m a 23 year old female, no known health problems and a healthy weight. Thanks!

UPDATE!	My aunt is finally awake after a month in a medically induced coma on 90% ECMO and 10% ventilator!! She can not speak due to the tracheotomy and she is on heavy amounts of dilaudid to minimize the incredible pain she is in. She was able to squeeze my dads finger and blink to respond to his questions. She confirmed she knew who he was and why she was there. I’m starting feel hope for her again!!! Next step is toning the life support down little by little as her lungs heal❤️	UPDATE! My aunt is finally awake after a month in a medically induced coma on 90% ECMO and 10% ventilator!!

Grandpa just passed. Can the swelling of one eye and one side of the face a sign of COVID-19?	"So, long story short, my grandpa just died of pneumonia. Two weeks prior he woke up with a swollen lower eyelid that extended to all the right side of his face up to the cheeks, making him have a permanent ""wink"" expression. Although the swelling went away after a couple of days, he then started with arrhythmia and later respiratory insufficiency. After a week at the hospital he started to get better. Two days ago, he quickly deteriorated and today he passed away. He was not tested for COVID-19 since the place he's from supposedly doesn't have in-community circulation yet. Still, he had many of the symptoms including bilateral pneumonia, arrhythmia and confussion/delirium. What I can't understand is what was the cause of the swelling. I understand that SARS-CoV-2 can enter throught the eyes, could this have triggered and inflamatory response that would cause this swelling?"	"Grandpa just passed.

I've recovered from COVID about 5 weeks ago. I'm still taking every precaution possible. What are the risks of reinfections? Does anyone have any data?	Hi guys. I recovered pretty recently from COVID, and while I got away with only a bout of anosmia and minor breathlessness, my mom and dad had a drop in O2 sats and although they did not need hospitalisation, it was still a very scary experience. I'm still taking all precautions, but if possible, I'd like to know the frequency and/or chances of reinfections based on data. It'd be a great help. Thanks.

Could I have had it?	I’m normally pretty fit, rarely (if ever) get sick. I work in the city (Sydney) next to Chinatown. I catch packed trains to and from work an hour each way. About three and a half weeks ago when Sydney only had about 50 confirmed cases I was feeling a bit tired on a Sunday, cant remember if I had a sore throat. I distinctly remember (and double checked with my wife who said I felt warm) I had a fever that night. Next day had a mild dry cough started up, feeling a tiny bit tired all week. The cough over the next few days grew gradually worse, my lungs felt very easily irritated. My urine was noticeably dark (dont think I had a fever). Didnt feel like anything I had before. No runny nose either. Day 5 and 6 I was short of breath especially in the evenings (had a couple of beers tho) but was worried enough to keep a phone nearby. I have a pulse oxymeter, spo2 was around 93, higher than usual heart rate.

Family with cancer diagnosed with Covid-19	Hi guys, one of my mother's close friends and family friend has recently been diagnosed with covid-19 after picking it up in a hospital while recovering from brain surgery to remove a malignant tumour. She also has cancer of the liver, breast and crucially lung.

anybody have a soar throat/swollen glands as post viral fatigue symptoms?	I got diagnosed June 20th and I was only really sick the first 5 days except for the fatigue that everybody is talking about which has lingered. I work a manual labor job that I may have went to hard at the past couple weeks, now i have worse fatigue, soar throat, and swollen glands that haven't gone away for several days despite all my efforts (been laying in bed most of the day, meditating for literally hours, and drinking hot tea like a crack head) Anybody else have a sore throat after they've healed? Debating going to urgent care but not sure what they would do..I'm just afraid it's another virus like mono (I have chronic mono also, meaning it can be triggered) and not just post viral symptoms..	anybody have a soar throat/swollen glands as post viral fatigue symptoms?

Cousin was fine no symptoms and passed overnight because she went in for chest pain.	My cousin was 22 years old healthy and now she’s gone. Overnight she was having chest pains and when she got to the hospital died from a heart attack. She lives with my aunt and uncle. Over the nest few days the whole family went to pay our respects. Now my uncle is in the hospital positive for COVID. He is showing signs of neumonía and they are doing a plasma transfusion from someone that survived COVID hoping that helps. As for me and my wife, we were both over at their house without masks or anything. How likely is it we caught it? I am worried for my 2 daughters. COVID was the last thing on our mind since the hospital told us she passed from a heart attack. It’s been 6 days so far and we are showing no symptoms.

I’ve been having point/ pokey pain in my chest?	I *may* have had exposure 2-3 days ago. Could this be a precursor to covid or something else? Edit: it’s not constant. It comes and goes.

Anybody else’s symptoms come and go?	17ftm, occasional smoker, non drinker, no relevant health conditions. Presumed positive via virtual screening, getting tested within the next week. It feels like my symptoms only occur every 2-3 hours. Like, I’ll have shortness of breath, a cough, a scratchy throat, and fatigue for a few hours... and then it’ll just stop. I feel almost completely fine right now, but in a couple hours I’ll be feeling bad. It’s really strange. Is it possible that my issues are due to allergies or something, or is it common with COVID-19 to have intermittent symptoms like this?

Tuesday 9/22: no more sore throat, extremely clogged sinuses, lots of sinus pressure. Decide to go to urgi care to check if it’s a sinus infection. Bloodwork - negative for infection Flu swab - negative for flu The doc says “let’s swab you for COVID just in case” Wednesday 9/23: feeling a lot less congested.

Could my CFS last this long and be related to Covid-19?	I live in California and we now know that we were getting cases as early as the beginning of February, much earlier than we thought. Nearly my entire company became very sick at the end of February. Looking back now, I'm fairly certain it was COVID -19, my entire company feels the same. It was absolutely terrible and I was scared. I'm young but have a preexisting condition and my lungs were burning but I used heavy doses of mullein leaf extract (lung support) and olive leaf extract (antiviral), along with a long list of other supplements and I pulled through. However, ever since then I have been experiencing extreme fatigue, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and occasionally my lymph nodes will flair up. I had fatigue before but its dramatically increased since February. Now, after reading everyone's posts, I'm wondering if it could be related to Covid-19?

How many people with heart symptoms have had clean cardiac tests?	My heart was beating fast for like a month. Went away for a month, now it’s back -_-.

Rough night.	It's been just over a month since I started having symptoms.

Fruity Pebbles Torture	I’m 28 days from onset of symptoms, 26 days from confirmation of positive. I was sick for 11 days, including loss of smell and taste, fever, cough and congestion. The lack of taste was annoying at first, but manageable. Now it’s become the bane of my waking hours. Get this: I have not enjoyed a bowl of fruity pebbles in 8 years, since moving out of my parents house. It was my dads favorite guilty pleasure cereal. For the last 4 days I cannot BREATHE without getting sick to my stomach. It truly feels like I have a mouthful of these CURSED fruity pebbles every time I breathe. Wondering about those of you who have also lost taste.... I really have never had a sweet tooth, and am a social (so obviously n/a, this year) smoker. It is cereal water torture.

How long were you sick/have you been sick?	My wife has been symptomatic since 3/12, I became symptomatic on 3/20, and our 10 year old son started showing a low grade fever on the 27th. We're all doing okay, and are experiencing mild symptoms. Mostly fever and fatigue with a mild cough or slight chest pain - except my son who only has a fever. This feels like it's going on forever with no end in site. So, how long have you had symptoms before they went away? If you're still symptomatic, how long has it been since you started showing symptoms? Does anyone know if there's a certain point you get to where you can stop worrying (so much) about a fast decline? I've tried looking up this kind of information online, but can't find anything. Thank you for responding. Edit: I was given a positive test result on 3/28.	How long were you sick/have you been sick?

Mostly fever and fatigue with a mild cough or slight chest pain - except my son who only has a fever. This feels like it's going on forever with no end in site. So, how long have you had symptoms before they went away? If you're still symptomatic, how long has it been since you started showing symptoms? Does anyone know if there's a certain point you get to where you can stop worrying (so much) about a fast decline? I've tried looking up this kind of information online, but can't find anything. Thank you for responding. Edit: I was given a positive test result on 3/28.	0

I got tested yesterday but am questioning that my symptoms are not severe enough.	Hi all, my job decided we were mandatory and reopened to offer summer camp to youth in our county. As I’m sure you all can imagine, the mask wearing and social distancing they promised has been nearly impossible to consistently implement with children and teens. For a few days I started feeling like I was getting a sore throat and very exhausted. The sore throat was mild so I just assumed it was allergies and continued my daily life. Yesterday I woke up and my sore throat was no longer mild and ignorable but also wasn’t crazy severe. I had also developed an ear ache and a headache. Also some mild shortness of breath. I would walk to my car and be out of breath or up a short flight of stairs and find it hard to breathe. Now I’m home with some chest pain and shortness of breath. Being cautious because I’m working with the community I saw a doctor yesterday about my sore throat. The doctor did not seem confident that I had covid but told me she believes my symptoms are caused by a virus. I’m at home now at least until I get the results.

Anyone else feel symptoms of anxiety beyond their normal state?	"Background: I feel anxious all the time, and have been through a number of stressful circumstances in my life that have produced severe bouts of anxiety, but have never, ever had anything close to a panic attack or anxious shortness of breath at any point. When I had COVID (tested positive), towards the beginning, I would be sitting, doing work, relatively calm (it was a mild case), and suddenly I would feel like a sudden wave of anxiety followed by shallow breathing. I wasn't even thinking of the virus, it wasn't some breakdown or triggering moment, I just suddenly had a spike of panic that came with shallow breathing. There was no chest pain, no difficulty taking deep breaths, but shallow breathing - panic attack style. I do *not* think this was ""shortness of breath"" in the clinical sense of actual lung problems). Out of nowhere I essentially started freaking out, verging on panic attack. When it happened (only a few times over a couple of days) I was always able to calm myself down and reign it in. I know that having COVID-19 is stressful, but as I mentioned, I've never had anxiety that manifested in this way before,"	"Anyone else feel symptoms of anxiety beyond their normal state?

Sharp chest pain	Hey gang. So my wife tested positive last week and I'm almost 100% sure I have it as well. I haven't gotten tested yet, but I've had some symptoms that she had and her uncle (ER doctor) thinks I might have it. My symptoms thus far Tiredness Stuffy nose Chest pain The chest pain is new to me and freaking me out. It's in between my pecs center of my sternum. It's a sharp stabbing like pain. I would call it annoying as it's not unbearable. Breathing is fine and o2 levels are 97%. Anyone experience similar pain or know what it might be?	Sharp chest pain Hey gang.

When should you go to the hospital?	Been sick on and off for 5 months because of chronic stress and poor sleep. Was tested negative in early June, got tested almost two weeks ago because of a scare(still waiting on results) but everyone ended up getting back a negative test as well ostensibly no symptoms. I've been isolating but still been around some family as they dismiss me since I'm a hypochondriac and everyone I knew who thought they were exposed came back negative. I initially only had fatigue, and maybe one day of a runny nose before the scare, but for a week now I've had occasional flare-ups of something I'd describe as vertigo. Since I've been quarantining for two weeks I imagine I would have contracted it over two weeks ago and no one in my family seems to show ANY symptoms yet I've developed a dry cough(not bad) but a noticeable chest discomfort. It doesn't hurt, I'm hardly out of breath but I FEEL my left lung and it's now turned into a mild burning sensation. I have right now no other symptoms other than the burning lung, a mild cough, and waves of fatigue. I have not had a fever at all really	When should you go to the hospital?

Day 26 in the ICU	I made a post a few weeks ago about my dad. Since then he’s had a pneumothorax and we were told he wouldn’t survive it if he had one and he did thankfully. He’s still in the icu and it’s been day 26 since he’s been on a ventilator with a paralytic. Yesterday they took him off the paralytic to see if he would continue to breathe with the ventilator and unfortunately he started breathing against and had to be put back on the it. We were told that he took a step back when trying to wean him off the paralytic because they had to move his ventilator settings back up to 100% when before he was at around 80%. His doctors have said that this is the longest time one of their patients has been on paralytic due to covid. They took a CT scan and the brain scan came back normal, his oxygen saturation is 92, blood pressure is okay, and all of his other organs are fine it’s just his lungs that are severely effected.

First week, mild symptoms. 2 weeks better, 4th week different symptoms.	22m, smoker Still waiting for my test results, but I felt kind of sick for about a week, light cough, headaches. (some symptoms probably attributed to nicotine withdrawal. I still wasn't sure if i was even positive) That lasted for about a week, then I started to feel better for a week, that's when I got tested as well. Another week goes by of feeling fine, and then I decided to drink last night. I woke up this morning with a pretty nasty hangover, and then after eating, noticed a sharp pain in my chest that happened in a specific point of breathing in or out. I got a bit anxious, and then started feeling congested, which is normal for me after I eat. But I couldn't quite clear it up.

Waiting for my test result, these have been my symptoms.	Sigh. I’m so disappointed I am writing here. I’m from New Jersey and commuted to NYC daily until mid March. Covid scared the crap out of me. As a result, I was a model quarantine participant. I didn’t leave the apartment at all except to visit my girlfriends family. I didn’t go to the grocery store, pharmacy, or anything. I spent oodles of money on grocery delivery. Which takes me to a week ago. I noticed a weird metallic taste when I was eating strawberry yogurt. I noticed it again when I ate tomato sauce the next day. 4 days later, I’ve developed a sore throat, and shortness of breath. I’m still able to run every morning but I notice it more when I’m lying.

Had to have popped a false negative, right?	So March 16th I came home since my entire college was shut down. Two days later me and my mother became sick. I’ve gotten the flu 100 times and it’s never felt like this. Not like this was worse, in fact it wasn’t that bad. I had a 103 fever for literally 24 hours and it was gone.

Tested positive Monday Oct 5th	I have been a religious mask wearer and have only gone out a few times. I am almost positive I received Covid from my experience at Dunkin’ Donuts. The young man who made my coffee wasn’t wearing a mask and I refused to drink the coffee. I threw it away, but I’m thinking it was on the lid of the cup. I was worried, so I took a test last Monday, and got the results Friday and it said I was positive. I had super blurry vision on the 4th and a mild headache on the 5th. Typical symptoms of a cough and runny nose. I had diarrhea this morning and I’m wondering if that also is a symptom. I haven’t read anything about that, but it’s still making me nervous. Hoping to get in to see a dr tomorrow. All in all, this is the worst ever I have been ill. I self quarantined since the day I went to get my test.

Anyone developed nausea/vomiting after 2nd week?	29F, haven’t been tested due to age and no underlying conditions, but ER doctor told me I most likely have it. I am on day 21 of symptoms. First two weeks it was mostly fever, SOB and diarrhea. Now it has moved on to full on nausea and loss of appetite. I am devastated because it has already lasted so long...Anyone on the same boat?

Might’ve been exposed to covid 9 days ago.	9 days ago I had a date with my girlfriend who tested positive for covid 19 yesterday. 9 days ago was out date and we kissed a lot so I’m thinking i have might have it. They started showing symptoms a couple days after that day but I’m yet to experience any, also have a normal temperature and feel perfectly healthy. I’m getting tested tomorrow to make sure but i’m also thinking I might’ve gave it to her and i’m a symptomatic. She works at a restaurant and i’m currently on leave so I haven’t been to work for about a month so there’s also a possibility she got it from work, regardless i’m really nervous i’ll develop symptoms soon because i heard people develop them around day 9-14 which is where i’m creeping up on since being exposed (maybe) I’ll keep you guys updated on my results when I get them, until then i’ll self quarantine. also, has anyone with mild asthma recovered from covid without getting hospitalized? that’s what i’m most worried about, also my mother with a compromised immune system.. i really hope I didn’t get her sick but no one in the family is showing any	Might’ve been exposed to covid 9 days ago. 9 days ago I had a date with my girlfriend who tested positive for covid 19 yesterday. 9 days ago was out date and we kissed a lot so I’m thinking i have might have it.

Crazy heart rate/SOB during shower (50+ days of symptoms)	I have noticed that my heart rate spikes to a ridiculous extent whilst showering. I can feel it is around 150-160 bpm, triggered just by standing in the shower and after contact with warm water. Just by standing up usually it does not go up to this extent (post covid it is usually 90-100 just standing up vs 150-160 whilst showering). I also notice after my shower my pulse stays elevated for 30ish minutes and my ox levels just after coming out are on the low side of normal 95/96. Could this be a sign of a nervous system dysfunction or what? Is anyone else noticing this?

On and off symptoms every other day?/Trouble sleeping	Hi, I’m currently on day 20 and I seem to be having 2 leftover symptoms that only show up every other day. I’ll have a headache one day, the next back pain, the next headache, etc. It’s been like this for several days now. Is anyone else experiencing this? Is anyone also having trouble sleeping? I typically have trouble sleeping over the summers (since I was about 15, I’m 21) but I would take melatonin and eventually fall asleep. I took 21 mg of melatonin last night and I don’t think I fell asleep until 5 AM. I have noticed some brands of melatonin have worked better than others but does anyone have any tips? I would like to be able to sleep :(	On and off symptoms every other day?/Trouble sleeping Hi, I’m currently on day 20 and I seem to be having 2 leftover symptoms that only show up every other day.

Day 8 (Tested Positive)	Hi all, Wanted to share my experience for posterity's sake, I guess, from Austin, Texas. Also wanted to see how many of you have experienced a second wave of symptoms. **Day 1 -** I'd felt relatively fine, if not a bit worn down, so thought nothing of going on an intense hike and film shoot in the Texas Hill Country. The shoot involved a lot of steep hills. By the evening, I experienced the most intense body aches I've ever had. It felt as if I'd been suddenly stricken with severe arthritis throughout. Immobilizing back, neck, and head pain. A weird side effect was tingling shooting down to my arms and fingers. I really thought I'd slipped a few discs or something. When I finally got home (it was an effort even getting out of the car), I clocked a 101.5 temperature. I took aspirin because it was the only thing I had at home. The fever was pretty scary - shakes, chills, and awful dreams. **Day 2 -** Woke up, clocked a 99.9 temp, slept all day and could still hardly move. **Day 3 -** Finally got into a testing clinic where I waited for five hours (in my	Day 8 (Tested Positive) Hi all, Wanted to share my experience for posterity's sake, I guess, from Austin, Texas.

Worried I've got covid, made worse by severe panic disorder	So I'm getting very worried that I may have covid. Currently experiencing headaches, stuffy nose, some occiasional burning/tightness in chest, and a phlegmy sore throat. Have not had any coughs, fever or fatigue, or loss of taste and smell. Have also not left the house for almost 2 weeks, and was masked and strictly social distanced while I was out. Have probably only left the house 15 times in total since March, and at least 5 of them were masked in the last month or 2. None of my family is ill at all, and they also have been strictly distancing for months. I also have panic attacks and a severe panic disorder, which is accompanied by physical symptoms like sob, chest pain, headaches, muscle aches, and rapid heart beats. This anxiety has made me very paranoid since the beginning of all this, so I've been very safe and strict. For more reference I'm in Australia, in NSW where cases are quite low atm, only having an increase of about 10 a day. What do you think the chances are of me having covid? I'm isolating at home atm, but I'm very scared to get a test.	Worried I've got covid, made worse by severe panic disorder So I'm getting very worried that I may have covid.

I'm worried	"A little back ground about me, I'm a huge Germaphobe ! Always have been, I rarely get sick because my hygiene Is so good. It's one of the only things I can truly pride myself on.

I felt kinda rough all day but I still went about my day as I just assumed it was my allergies. However I woke up today , the sneezing has gone completely and now I have an itchy/ slightly sore throat and i cant smell very well , i can still slightly taste but i think I'm losing my taste due to lack of smell.

Keeping up with chores and other ADLs- how do you manage to get by with Covid?	Hi, all. My partner and I ended up getting our test results back yesterday. We wanted to believe that it would be something else, -anything- else, but we’re positive. I’ve been sick for about five days now. He’s been sick for six or seven. We’re a reasonably healthy couple (aside from me having some GI issues, PCOS, and moderate asthma) in our early thirties. I work from home, and he works in the office for his family’s construction company. His employer/family hasn’t taken the virus seriously though. We barely leave the house (aside from him going to work, groceries, picking up take-out and solitary outdoor activities), but we still got sick. We wore masks. We socially distanced ourselves. We washed our damn hands. And yet here we are. I’m trying my best not to be angry or point the blame at anyone, but I’m frustrated and honestly scared. The first day or two for the both of us weren’t too bad. We both had an itchy tingling in our throats, but we attributed that to allergies or maybe sleeping with our mouths open. Then about three days in, the fevers, fatigue, headaches, complete loss of smell, and body aches started.	Keeping up with chores and other ADLs- how do you manage to get by with Covid? Hi, all.

Another Long Hauler Account	I’m 28, no pre-existing conditions, healthy, in shape, worked out 4-5 days a week, cardio and weights, I work in healthcare and am on my feet for most of the day (walk b/w 5,000-8,000 steps/day at work) So I was exposed June 22, symptomatic by the 26th with chest tightness, shortness of breath, and just overall didn’t feel right, left work early. Didn’t get tested until 2 days later. The next few days, prior to getting my positive result, my symptoms kind of intensified and I began to experience brain fog, significant fatigue, sinus pressure, diarrhea/loose stools and headaches. Never had a fever and I maybe coughed a handful of times. Test eventually came back + after like 7 or 8 days but I already knew I was +. Continued to quarantine from my wife, wore my mask at home for most of the day. After about 3 weeks I started to feel like I was recovering and getting better. I started working out again, cardio like jumping rope and some body weight exercises. After exercising I would feel like straight garbage so I stopped. Tachycardia started being more apparent, HR would go up to 140-150 from standing and walking.

Could I have had Covid?	So I remember the exact day I got infected. February 5th. My coworker just returned from Jamaica 2 days ago and started dry coughing at work. I was around him that day, went for coffee, chit chatting, etc. That evening my coworker developed fever and chills. The next evening of February 6th I started dry coughing and the following day (morning of February 7th) I developed fever and chills and felt like crap (typical flu symptoms). So around 1 day from infection to developing symptoms. 2 days since exposure the fever started. My coworker and I had the exact same symptoms, cough and fever and chills. He had a headache but I didn't. Don't remember if I had a loss of smell, I don't think so and don't really remember. I asked him if he remembers having loss of smell, he says he doesn't think he did. We both recovered after about a week but the weird thing is I'm still coughing on and off since end of February,like I have developed bronchitis or some weird post viral cough.

My dad (58) tested positive	2 days ago my father tested positive for covid 19. He has high blood pressure and no other pre existing health conditions. He went through drive thru testing 2 days after he started feeling symptoms including a small fever of 100, sweats, body aches, a cough and congestion. Luckily he says he does not feel prominent pain or pressure in his chest and is having no difficulty breathing. His fever has remained around 100 consistently for the past 4 days. He has mostly laid in bed and slept. Today he got out of bed, took a shower and did the dishes. I went to get him supplies and now he is fully stocked up on essentials. I am praying that he continues to feel more energy and that his symptoms do not worsen. I am worried because I have heard some people feel better before they feel worse. I just wanted to share my fathers symptoms as warnings to others. I will update this post when things change. Stay safe everyone.

Symptoms started yesterday, wanted to know if others had similar symptoms	Hi guys, I'm planning on getting a test first thing tomorrow morning. Yesterday, I felt as if I had mucus in my nose and it wasn't too big of an issue. I also felt extremely tired yesterday and I went to bed early and still woke up somewhat groggy. Today, I woke up and it feels as if the mucus that was stuck in my nose is now stuck in both my nose and throat. When I breathe in calmly, it almost sounds as if I'm snoring because there's something stuck in there. I actually coughed some mucus out today but it was clear which made it seem like allergies. I also felt extremely tired today and I took a two hour nap which I never do. I wanted to know if you guys think this is a concern and if anyone else has had similar problems. Thanks.

I also felt extremely tired today and I took a two hour nap which I never do. I wanted to know if you guys think this is a concern and if anyone else has had similar problems. Thanks.	0
Full body rash? Pins and needles?	Hello all, still waiting on my results but I was advised I probably have it. 28M, started showing symptoms on Tuesday, June 30th. First 3 days I had rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, skull cracking headaches and body aches. Fever topped out at 101.9 before breaking on Friday. Now, 5 days after I first started showing symptoms, many of which have faded or become mild, I have a full body rash that feels almost itchy but more like pins and needles. Sunlight seems to make it worse. Should I go to the hospital or take some allergy medication and ride it out? Anyone else experience anything like this?	Full body rash? Pins and needles?

Chest pain	When discussing chest pain, is it pain from coughing? Or do you experience other types of chest pain? I feel like I have a sheet of lava under my skin, like my chest wall is hot, but I haven’t had a cough.	Chest pain When discussing chest pain, is it pain from coughing?

"Anyone had that feeling of ""getting a fever"" but for days?"	"So from the weekend I've had more burning eyes sensation than usual. And from Tuesday til today (Friday) I've felt more ache-y and fatigued and have had a very light but constant post nasal drip w/ a lump-in-my-throat kind of itch. The fatigue and aches are on and off, some days it's bad, others I feel fine with just a slight runny nose. I am prone to getting sinus infections but this is definitely not the usual path and time table of the symptoms. It just feels like that ""I think I'm gonna have a fever"" but the 100+ fever never comes. Wondering if anyone who tested positive also had a similar experience as I want to protect my family and loved ones as soon as possible."	"Anyone had that feeling of ""getting a fever"" but for days?

Allergies?	Hi everyone! I’ve been creeping on this page throughout the pandemic. I work in healthcare and I have a bit of health anxiety. For the past couple days I’ve been having very mild sinus pressure (bridge of my nose) causing a dull headache and feel like my ears need to pop. I’ve always had allergies and always get symptoms in the spring and fall when pollen is high (aka right now). I have been spending more time outside because the weather is finally mild and I’ve been keeping my windows open. I’m pretty sure this is from my typical allergies as this happens every year and I have no other symptoms. But hearing about people test positive with minor symptoms has me a little worried.

Doctors say I might go home tomorrow!	I've been here over two weeks. I came off a ventilator Friday after seven days on it. Clots were my main issue.

I'm still here to cherish every waking moment with my husband and my daughters. And I will not squander it.	Doctors say I might go home tomorrow! I've been here over two weeks.

Tested positive a month ago, now experiencing mild symptoms. What do I do?	I tested positive a month ago, quarantined and everything. Felt fine and returned to the world. Today I woke up with a sore throat and headache, and am now getting worried. I thought reinfection this soon was not supposed to happen. Should I get retested, I've heard it could still be positive from my case a month ago? Is it probable that this is just the cold or the flu? Should I still quarantine if I feel better tomorrow?

After effects of Covid	I've recovered from Covid but my husband and I are having a lot of symptoms that we think are related. The worse one for me is the constant smell of cigarette smoke. I researched and apparently that can happen after a bad cold or sinus infection that affects your olfactory system. I did lose complete sense of smell during Covid so I'm assuming that's where this has come from. It's driving me mad. I hate the smell of cigarettes.

False negative result? Did/do we have it? What do you mean?	Mid February my daughter became sick a few days after she went to ballet class. Her ballet teacher is an Italian woman who just came back from Italy. The outbreak in Italy at that time was not widely known but it must have already been spreading there. It started with a slight dry cough which developed into a very wet cough (that's why I didn't think of covid-19, because it was so wet, lots of phlegm) and a fever. The fever was not insanely high but my daughter was very tired and slept half the day, very unusual for her. About 5 days later my other kids got sick, cough, fever and extreme fatigue. The fever was intermittend, went away and came again for a few days. My 4 year old was especially sick, he felt awful and cried a lot at night, I think something must have hurt him really bad (he has autism and is nonverbal), gave him paracetamol so he could sleep. After fever and the cough they developed a stuffed nose, overall very much phlegm. Week 2 was better, a little cough and stuffed nose still. My oldest (7) also threw up once (but that's not	False negative result? Did/do we have it? What do you mean? Mid February my daughter became sick a few days after she went to ballet class.

Be careful with Mucinex	I get a lot of lung infections and my favorite OTC medication has always been Mucinex. It has worked on every cold and flu ever but not on covid. There is just nothing to cough up. I have had very sticky stuff in my lungs but I don’t think the pressure in this virus is phlegm it’s damage. I tried taking it and it made things worse. Please don’t take this without being very careful.	Be careful with Mucinex I get a lot of lung infections and my favorite OTC medication has always been Mucinex.

Overwhelming anxiety after “recovering.”	26/F/54 days since 1st symptoms. It’s been almost two months since I first started experiencing Covid-19 symptoms. I have never been presumed positive as at the time I was sick, the symptoms I had were not declared as official symptoms. I had mild/moderate symptoms and was so terrified during the duration of those 8-9 days, it was crippling. Now that I’m feeling better, my anxiety is just as awful as I’ve read articles of individuals with mild symptoms being recovered or asymtomatic and recovered and experiencing strokes after 2 months. My anxiety is crippling me. I am so freaked out and worried that something like this can happen to me, my boyfriend who did not develop symptoms at all, or my father who also got it.

Did I get tested too soon ?	Last Friday ( July 31st) my coworker got a call saying that the previous week she had worked with someone who tested positive. So I decided to go and get tested on Monday ( August 3rd) and now I’m waiting on my results. I’m wondering if I got tested too soon ?? On Tuesday I got a headache after I ate and it comes and goes away. Besides that I feel a little tired but it’s only every now and then. My coworker hasn’t shown any symptoms and got tested after me so I’m still waiting on her test results. We were both wearing masks if that helps at all.

Need suggestions. Trying to stay hopeful.	My mom started showing symptoms on 9/26 and tested positive on 9/29. She keeps saying she feels awful but has no energy to really go into details. My dad is home taking care of her. She's already gone to the emergency room once but was discharged the same day. They said her oxygen levels are normal. She is a type 2 diabetic. What can I do to help my mom? What should I be asking the doctors? They didn't even let us in when she went last time and she doesn't speak English so I'm not sure anything was done for her. For those who have diabetes, what were you able to eat that was easy on the stomach and didn't set your sugar levels off too much? I'm trying to find anything to do to feel more active. I'm open to any suggestions. She keeps saying she feels like she's going to die and I'm trying to stay positive but I'm really starting to freak out. She sounds like she's getting worse when I talk to her on the phone.	Need suggestions. Trying to stay hopeful. My mom started showing symptoms on 9/26 and tested positive on 9/29.

Pneumonia treatment at home. Any suggestions?	Hello, My father(M, 60y/o) tested positive on 5/5, about two weeks ago. During the few days after the results, we called the doctor and he prescribed some medication for my father to take so we started that regimen. We took him to the hospital on 5/11 and he was admitted to the hospital for SOB. Chest X-ray revealed that he has pneumonia (was caught early so it was mild) and was kept there for 9 days until 5/20. He was discharged but still has pneumonia which the doctor gave antibiotics and scheduled him for a follow up visit and chest X-ray in 1-2 weeks. He was also given portable oxygen tanks and a concentrator to keep at home. He hasn’t needed the oxygen at all yet and he regularly walks around the house and gets up to use the bathroom or sit outside - claiming he doesn’t need O2. I use an oximeter to regularly check his levels and they are good, usually around 92-95(after activity) and 96 resting. I wanted to ask you guys, does anyone have anything to help with pneumonia, that can be done at home? Like certain exercises, foods, methods, etc. He takes antibiotics to help	Pneumonia treatment at home. Any suggestions? Hello, My father(M, 60y/o) tested positive on 5/5, about two weeks ago.

Were they severe? •What, if anything, helped with your symptoms? •Are you having any lasting symptoms even after “recovering”? Feel free to add anything else you think would be informative.

Getting tested tomorrow, only symptom left after 5 days is chest pain. What did your chest pain feel like?	Hi hello, I work as a phlebotomist at a plasma center, and on Saturday, July 25, I left work because of nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, cough and sore throat on my right side. That day I felt exhausted and cold. And by day 5, I have no symptoms other than chest, it sort of feels like it’s being pushed from above. I went back to work today and took ibuprofen and after it wore off I took more in hopes it would ease the pain and it only came back worse. What did your chest pain feel like? I am really unsure what the results may. I think negative but for peace of mind for my job and myself I set up an appointment tomorrow for testing.

GF tested positive today, and probably had it back in March	Just sharing our story here to spread awareness. You CAN get this thing twice, or symptoms can rear up again. Back in March (coincidentally, on the same day the National Emergency was declared, and Friday the 13th), my girlfriend left work early with a fever and dizziness. No one took us seriously: “it’s just a cold”, “you’re overreacting”, even my intelligent parents downplayed the possibilities. This “cold” lasted two weeks and involved crazy body aches, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and a mild cough and sore throat. She said she’s never felt anything like it. At this time we couldn’t get tested because doctors would laugh at us with the “honey, you have a cold” line. So she powered through and hoped it was nothing severe. Fast forward 4 months, to last week. We moved across the country to be with family, all the while using masks and social distancing. My mom is immunocompromised, so we take this incredibly seriously.

Anyone recovered and ended isolation according to guidelines and then infected someone else?	I’m worried about ending isolation and infecting someone, but I also know it could take months to test negative again. All my research says it should be fine to re-enter society after 10 days since symptoms start and 72 hours no fever etc etc cdc recommendations. I can’t really find any evidence to the contrary, that someone spread the virus after following these guidelines. Anyone have any anecdotal evidence of this? Or anecdotal evidence of ending isolation after 10 days and being around someone and not getting them sick?

Husband tested positive, I tested negative	We both got tested a week ago, got results yesterday, he’s positive, I’m negative. He has absolutely zero symptoms and feels great.

Lost my sense of smell as first sign.... what to expect next?	We haven’t gotten our tests back yet, but I’m 99% positive we have Covid. My only symptom right now is a headache on my left side (that seems manageable with ibuprofen) and complete loss of smell. I can still taste (woohoo!) but can’t smell a thing. I haven’t been able to smell anything since Wednesday. My question is... what else should I expect? No cough, drowsiness or shortness of breath right now. Don’t seem to have a fever either. I know everyone is different, but what else did those of you who had loss of smell as an initial symptom go through?	Lost my sense of smell as first sign.... what to expect next?

UK self-isolation period?	So I tested positive this morning, after experiencing symptoms and getting tested on Sunday.

Anyone know which is correct?	UK self-isolation period? So I tested positive this morning, after experiencing symptoms and getting tested on Sunday.

Was your swab test excruciatingly painful? Mine was.	I was just tested today and it was absolutely excruciating to the point I thought I might puke. Pain is still there over an hour later although it's finally getting better. I haven't read much about other people's experiences with it so I'm curious if everyone found it as painful or did I maybe just wriggle around too much? Also, I don't want to deter anyone from being tested if they can/should be. I was just given zero information of what to expect beforehand so it came as quite a shock.

false negative?	"Hi all. So here is my situation. I started feeling severe fatigue last Sunday so I went to urgent care. They did a finger prick test which revealed that I have IGM antibodies. The doctor told me these antibodies usually mean the person has early covid...my layman's understanding is they're the bad antibodies, not the good ones that show you've had covid and since recovered. He said that with the finger prick test and my symptoms, it was almost certain I have covid. However, I just saw my nasal swab test online, and that came back negative. So on the one hand I've got the ""bad"" antibodies and the symptoms. On the other hand, the nasal swab was negative. I spoke to my aunt (a nurse), and she is inclined to think I am positive. She thinks that perhaps when I got the test, my RnA was not yet high enough to be detectable. I think she's right and I'm positive. After all, I'm still quite exhausted all day. However, any thoughts from the group would be most appreciated. Thanks very much!"	"false negative? Hi all. So here is my situation.

Respiratory damage/symptom mitigation: has anyone seen any resource/research looking at home-based damage limitation for those of us covid+ who are not severe enough to go to ER but have respiratory symptoms? (W44, day 7)	It’s frustrating to think that in the world we formerly knew, I feel like any type of pneumonia would land you in hospital, but today you can’t even go for a check-up until your o2 levels drop dangerously low. I have zero pre-existing condition so this is all new to me. Not asking for tips if it’s breaking the rules - but any links to existing research would be appreciated. Some of the example questions I have: - are asthma-management tips useful in case of established covid respiratory symptoms (eg respiratory exercises) - can a ventolin-type inhaler be used without a check-up (I have been given one by a relative) - is it generally better to ‘let the cough out’ or is it better to try and manage it (I currently can hold 80% in but not sure if that’s a good idea) - is it ok to breathe above steam to clear airways (I feel this alleviates my symptoms but can it damage lungs?) - would it be better to ‘let it pass’ (advice of my national covid helpline) or would a mucus-breaking OTC medication help? Thanks everyone.

Day 29 since symptom onset and my lungs are on fire and dry cough is bad again.	From my day 28 post: &gt;Age 20, no underlying conditions, healthy weight, nonsmoker. I tested positive sep 17th. Tested negative oct 7th (dont know if this even matters). Sep 16th-30th I was hellishly sick. Mainly respiratory symptoms, but no pneumonia detected. I got lucky. For the past week (days 21-28) Ive had shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, muscle aches, temperature range 99.5-100.5, sharp pains in lungs when I inhale deeply or sneeze or cough etc, headaches, feeling like total sh1t. Cant concentrate on my school work and it's all making me depressed. I'm feeling the same as yesterday but my lungs feel like they have fire inside and my dry cough is much worse. Feeling pressure in my chest like someone is sitting on my chest. My O2 saturation is sitting at 93-94, typically its 95 so it's only 1-2% down. Harder to breathe. I considered myself recovered on Oct 1st. Oct 1st was a great day. My sense of smell came back, I felt a lot better overall. The next day everything came back and it's been bad from there.

Just got test results as positive	After body aches and loss of appetite for 2 days, I started getting fever. My 101-102 F fever lasted for a week. I called hospital and they advised me to take acetaminophen 3 times a day. The fever along with headache would not subside. Sometime in between fever, I did go for a doctor appointment and tested for Covid-19. Today, early morning, I got test results back as positive. I dunno what to do now. The fever stopped around 2 days ago. I am intaking salt-sugar-water(as electrolyte), fruits, fiber-rich veggies, chicken, rice etc. I am staying quarantined alone as advised by doctor for at least 2 weeks. Will the fever return back? Should I clean whole room I stay? What else should I do? Are there any diet I should change?

Did things start tasting weird or different?	I have noticed that my sense of taste is out of wack. I opened a new bottle of water and it tasted weird, almost a chemical soapy taste. I chalked it up to a bad bottle or a fluke. But I have since noticed that popcorn I ate yesterday tasted slightly like lettuce, etc. It's like my taste buds are wired wrong, if that makes any sense.

No fever, just headaches?	Hi. Some 6 days ago I started feeling a little bit short of breath and had a very mild tingling in my throat and a fluttering sensation in my chest. This only lasted for a few short episodes and was accompanied by episodes of weakness. On Friday night, after a more demanding run, I woke up with muscle pain, stomach pain, feeling very cold and the feeling of fever onset. I checked my temperature and it was normal, so I just attributed this to physical effort and eventually fell asleep. The shortness of breath is no longer present, but since Friday I keep feeling under the weather with episodes of headaches, drowsiness, stomach aches and feeling cold. My back muscles also hurt. I keep checking my temperature but it’s always normal, however I keep feeling something is not right. Has anyone had this combination of symptoms in the early days, especially the lack of fever? Thank you in advance for your answers.	No fever, just headaches? Hi.

Fever topped out at 100.5. Was very tired and slept 2 hours on and the up a bit all night. Woke up at 5am and fever had broke on its own. Had to nap by 9am Saturday 6/27. Cough worsened all day Saturday. On Saturday night my wife lost all her taste and smell. It’s been her only symptom. Sunday 6/28 - more coughing, general fatigue. At 2pm got a call that my test was positive. Was told need to quarantine for 10 days (including wife and kids) from first symptom. The doctor said To assume they are all positive. Even though my kids have no symptoms. Overall felt pretty good though. Went to bed by 9pm. Monday 6/29 - Up at 5:30 (normal). Cough started to really improve. Still some achiness but overall pretty good. Had to take a nap by 9:30 AM however :-)	43 year old male First symptom was Friday 6/26. Started with light cough.

Burning chest?	To those that tested positive. What would you say the chest pain feels like? My chest started hurting today.

How was your back and chest pain with coronavirus?	Today is day 7 for me and this virus. My symptoms so far consisted of acid reflux, sore throat, diahreea, all day headaches, night sweats and chills and the most annoying body aches. Right now all I'm dealing with is body aches. Mainly my back and chest but my back is the one that's most bothersome. I've had the aches since day 3. They would come and go and I could ease them simply by changing to a more comfortable position. But today this is just annoying and making my anxiety flare up and probably making the pain worse. I'm a healthy 27f. And it honestly feels like I did a back workout for the first time and I have bad delayed muscle soreness. Does this get better? How long did your back pain last and did it continue after recovering?

Caught Covid twice.	Exactly what the title says. Caught Covid May 8th (positive test) Recovered June 1st (negative test, no more symptoms) Went back to work. Resumed regular life. Was fine. Randomly felt sick June 25th, got tested 26th, and went to the ER June 28th where they told me my test from the 26th was negative. I was put on IV fluids in the ER because my heart rate was high as well as my lactic acid, did x rays and tests where they said I was ok to go home, however they tested me again because they assumed I had a false negative according to my symptoms. Just got the call today that my test came back positive once again. Doctor explained that I re caught the virus and that when people get it a second time they don’t get as sick. I’m so confused and upset. Just please be careful I was really hoping maybe this was just inflammation from the previous virus but I guess not.	Caught Covid twice. Exactly what the title says.

Post-covid rash?	Hi! I was told I had covid in April (symptoms and fever from Apr 1- Apr 21), but there were no tests at the time as I was in NYC at the height of the pandemic. Anyway, my question: since recovering, I've developed a malar (butterfly) rash on my face, mostly on my cheeks. I can't find anything about this online. Has anyone else experienced this? My only other post-covid symptoms were mono-like fatigue and a bad cough that comes and goes.	Post-covid rash? Hi!

I only ask because I went to the ER after Gallbladder surgery the previous day, i had severe abdominal pain and a temperature. They basically dismissed my surgery and said it was probably covid. Coincidentally the day after my surgery? Well they told me that I would recieve results in 2-5 days. Whats odd is they called back in less than 20 hours claiming I had covid. I asked if I could be retested at a different Facility and they said yes. So I get retested tomorrow. I'll still follow quarantine restrictions (which I already have been doing). I was just curious if anyone else has gotten suspicious, retested, and got a negative. That hospital in particular has really bad ratings and after surgery and the ER visit yesterday I will not being going to that hospital anymore.

How long did your symptoms last?	Hi everyone. I started showing slight symptoms on Monday, ended up getting tested (and having the worst of my symptoms) on Wednesday, and got my positive results back on Friday. My fever and most of my other symptoms have been gone for a few days, but my chest discomfort is and a few other symptoms have been lingering off and on. How long did it take for you to feel completely normal again? Do you have any tips to help with the symptoms?	How long did your symptoms last? Hi everyone.

Week 5 and still sick, but only having neurological symptoms	Initially I only suffered with body aches and fever, which went away quickly, and a few days later lost sense of smell and taste, which went on for weeks, but nothing else. A few days ago however, I started experiencing numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, in addition to an uncomfortable hot sentation in my spine. Sometimes I also have a bit of dizziness and lightheadedness, without headache. Just wondering if anyone out there with Covid has similar symptoms?

Lurking Subreddit Journalists	Hey all! Hope this post is allowed. I was listening to a recent episode of NPR’s Here and Now, featuring a journalist and host from Al Jezeera English. She referenced this sub, relayed medical information from commenters, and mentioned usernames. The journalist in question used this medical information as anecdotal research. Just wanted to send a friendly reminder about posting personal information. Has anyone been contacted directly for permission to use their information? Have any journalists identified themselves on this sub? Feel better, y’all. This is day 35 for me.	Lurking Subreddit Journalists Hey all! Hope this post is allowed.

How soon can you feel symptoms?	Met a friend (with masks) outside and started feeling a bit off a few hours after - tired, tickle in the throat. The next day I felt a general tiredness and a shortness of breath but no fever, cough, runny nose, or any other symptoms. I attribute this tiredness to sleep deprivation as well as dehydration from being in 106 degree weather for hours the day before. Is it possible to have symptoms hours after exposure?

Positive or not?	A month ago, I tested positive for Covid-19. Fast forward a month, I got tested again and received my results last week, I tested positive again. My state calls every person who has tested positive from Covid-19 to quarantine, but this time I didn't receive a call. I followed up with them after a week to ask them about my results, but they weren't able to help me and told me to call the lab. I called the lab, and they also were not able to help me, telling me I should talk with my doctor. Do I still have Covid-19? I might get tested again, maybe in 2 weeks. This has been worrying for me. I'm starting to feel like I have a clot or something since I get weird feelings in my legs (calf right side, not back, comes and goes). Probably anxiety though, since I have no consistent pain and it does not hurt to touch. Is blood clotting more common among people who have tested positive for Covid? If so, what are some things people can do to prevent blood clots (aside from excercising)?	Positive or not? A month ago, I tested positive for Covid-19.

Girlfriend has corona virus	My girlfriend got sick (7/24/20) and tested on (7/26/20) and got positive results (7/29/20) I’m currently in another state visiting family members questions: she lost her sense or smell and taste about how long did it take for you to get that back? When should it be safe for me to go back to her, she stopped getting fevers two days ago but still has a little cough and is tired still. Should i just wait till she test again this week? Or the 10 day waiting period plus her not having a fever for 24 hours Our dog since she got sick has also been acting strange. It won’t eat, lethargic, whimpers when my gf tries to pick her up to move. Can animals get Covid?

Shortness of breath + ANXIETY = bad combination. How are you dealing with this?	I'm 35/F generally healthy, on day 13 of this shit. Had mild gastrointestinal symptoms. I can't help but freak out when it happens. And guess what? Anxiety also brings shortness of breath and palpitations. So I find it really hard to determine when to run to the ER. My sister says that if I'm in doubt, then it's probably not necessary to go to the ER. Today I resourced to go and buy stuff for gardening and as soon as I got my mind into something else 50% of the symptoms went away. Now I feel perfectly fine. I'm looking for other people's experiences Also is it just me or the tiredness and shortness of breath usually happen in the morning?	Shortness of breath + ANXIETY = bad combination.

2 Studies have been launched for lingering symptoms	M 22 DAY 70 FRANCE I am not going to tell you what I went through these last 2 months because I think we all get this thing really SUCKS for long-termers. I juste wanted to tell you that 2 studies have been launched this week in my country. The first study will try to understand why symptoms linger for some people. I have heard they’ve tried treatments for loss of smell and taste... And the second one will try to understand why symptoms reappear in some people even weeks after first symptoms. Apparently at least 5% of infected people are concerned with this long-term form of the disease and mostly women. Hope things are also moving forward in the US for our cases. We’ve created a new # on Twitter in France and thanks to this, now media are covering our cases and some doctors are starting to pay attention to us. I think if we don’t speak for ourselves, nobody will ever care unfortunately.

Anyone with heart problems beat this thing?	I get tested tomorrow as I am having symptoms. I am 27, active, eat healthy, workout 4x a week, and generally in good health. My only issue is I have a heart abnormality called a right bundle branch block (RBBB). I've had every heart test under the sun, and the consensus is that it is benign but abnormal in someone my age. I'm a bit concerned if I am positive that this thing is going to bother my heart somehow. I really haven't been hearing many people say they have had heart issues with it on here. Anyone have heart problems/abnormalities battling this thing or have beaten it? Thanks!	Anyone with heart problems beat this thing? I get tested tomorrow as I am having symptoms.

Does sun exposure lead to muscle pain?	31m presumed positive, very mild, since feb 1, menthol throat, sob at night. Has anyone noticed that sun exposure led to muscle pains? When I went for a bike ride the other week, I was out for probably 2 hours, And I normally don’t wear sun screen. My arm got burned, but later that night I noticed muscle pains or ligament pains or bone pains right where I got burned. It felt like a “dead arm” when someone punches you. This happened more than once from far less exposure. I looked into this and this seems to happen to people who have lupus, and then I realized that this disease probably effects vit d production or absorption in some weird way. Anyone notice this?

What’s my risk?	Recently at work I found out a coworker had just tested positive. We tried to maintain our distance when we could but due to the job we often had to be within a couple feet of each other. We also used the same pen and touched the same objects. He tested positive three days ago and I still have to go into work, although I’m basically 10ft or more away from everyone now 90% of the time. I’m feeling fine but I was with the guy touching things the day he got sick. We wear masks so I think I’m mostly okay?? Thoughts??? Do I get tested even with no symptoms?	What’s my risk?

Two questions about positive tests: one for me, one for my brother.	1. I tested postive on a PCR test 9 (nine) days ago. Does that mean that I'm *probably* past the incubation period? I don't have any covid-19-specific symptoms, except perhaps a bit low energy. Normal body temperature, no loss of smell/taste, no difficulty breathing. I had palpitations a week ago, but I had them occasionally in the past too (I suffer from essential hypertension, well-controlled by medications). Should I expect to get sick? Or, since I didn't get sick this far, I probably wont? 2. Five days ago, my brother (we don't live together, nor contacted each other) tested positive for IgM antibodies, negative for IgG antibodies, and - a day later - tested *negative* in a PCR test. How is that possible? Does that mean that the PCR test is a false-negative? Or is there another possible scenario? Thank you for your thoughts, I appreciate them! Live long and prosper!

I mowed the lawn for a little bit today	I’m on week.... idek anymore. I also don’t know if my test was accurate, no antibodies. I’ve been pretty depressed so I thought I’d just try to suck it up and get up and do something. I have random chest wall pains still. I wake up tired. I have tachycardia and bradycardia depending on if I’m standing or sitting. My lawn was bad though and I have a self propelled mower. I did 65% of it before I had to stop. I don’t want to push myself too hard but I also don’t want all my muscles to atrophy. Sometimes I can’t tell if my symptoms are anxiety/depression or if they are Covid related. My o2 is good. My heart rate while mowing didn’t go above 165 today and I’ve only cried once. Small victories. What also helps me ( which is going to sound like I’m a terrible person) is looking at statistics for other 34 year olds. We do pretty well, even if a few don’t. I’m still too afraid to leave my house and either spread it ( or catch it at this point since maybe my pcr was wrong) I’ve been sick on and off since	I mowed the lawn for a little bit today I’m on week.... idek anymore.

19 year old male experiencing odd symptoms, could this be Covid?	So what I'm experiencing right now isn't considered typical covid-19 symptoms but I'm kinda iffy about it nonetheless so I want to see if anyone who's tested positive or any medical experts on here could give sound advice. 3 nights ago I started having a bit of a sore throat related to post-nasal drip/ mucus in the upper part of my throat. The pain has proceeded to get worse and better depending on the time of day over the last few days. Right now it doesn't feel terrible but this morning it felt almost felt like I had strep and my chest felt kinda weird when I first got out of bed, like a slight pressure but no pain or cough. Anyways that's the only symptoms I've experienced so far and it's been about 3 days since they've started. I don't think it's Covid but I also have pretty severe anxiety, especially anxiety related to death or being hospitalized so I wanted to just get a second opinion from someone.	19 year old male experiencing odd symptoms, could this be Covid?

Went out for my birthday	I had been staying home and only leaving if necessary, and they lifted restrictions. Went out Sat June 6 and developed the dry cough the following Thurs and got tested Fri June 12. Had about a week of chills fever, achy, sleeping. Fever was gone after 2 days. I got tested yesterday and I’m still showing positive! I have no symptoms and they won’t let me start my new job until I test negative. I plan on trying again tomorrow but I’m really concerned that it will still be positive. It’s getting harder and harder to get tested and the results are taking longer and longer.

Suffering since March. Life is just unfair...	Why does it seem like those who take precautions and are more wary of the virus are more prone to catching it. I see loads on here saying they took care and still ended up getting it. I did the same.... Back in March before the UK government moved its ass, I decided to move mine. Or should I say not move mine. I stayed at home to study, I only came into contact with family and I ordered online rather than going out shopping. Honestly in the two weeks before coming down with symptoms I can count on one hand the amount of people who could have possibly given me it. Everyone else was still going out to work or uni, seeing friends etc. etc. But suprise, suprise the 20 year old with no health conditions who was wary and taking measures to avoid the disease, gets the f*cking disease and no one else I know does. Four months later and I am still just as bad as I was in March with the typical waves of debilitating symptoms. I’ve dealt with anything and everything any “long hauler” has dealt with.

Neck cracking since having Covid	Had covid19 in April, pretty mild overall but one of the first things I noticed was a cracking neck. More than usual and louder/grindy.

Are persisting lowered spO2 levels indicative of permanent damage?	If someone had COVID and has noticed that their spO2 levels, which were previously always 97-98, have decreased to around 94-96, does this seem to imply permanent lung damage? I’ve noticed this for myself and it hasn’t gone away for about a month and a half... I’m concerned :/	Are persisting lowered spO2 levels indicative of permanent damage?

Update! Sharing my experience as a slightly fat, mildly asthmatic smoker	Hi everyone, This is an update to https://reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/g06yiz/sharing_my_experience_as_a_slightly_fat_mildly/ Firstly thank you to everyone’s nice messages of support when I posted 10 days ago. Secondly just wanted to give you all a happy update. The last time I posted I still wasn’t feeling great but day by day it’s got better. My throat no longer hurts, I’m still more fatigued that usual but I’m free of the dreaded virus now. I hope everyone is doing ok and I just wanted to pass on a positive update that even if you’re not the most healthy person in the world you can overcome it, you will feel shit, you’ll worry, you’ll take a while to get over it but in most cases you will get there. Stay safe if you can.	Update!

Mild symptoms; possible expose 7 days ago.	Hello group- my mom is a healthcare worker and we spent some time together outdoors last week 8/5. It was several hours and my kids were also playing around her/swimming etc. On Monday, my sister (who was also with us/lives with me) and I began experiencing sore throats and headaches. But we both brushed it off as allergies. My mom called us today and said that Monday night she came down with chills, body aches, headache, malaise. She was tested early yesterday am but it can back negative. I know there is a 30% false negative rate. Anyone have a similar story? I signed up for the ASU saliva test on Friday. Thanks!

Anyone else having crazy GI symptoms? So bloated I look pregnant.	I started having symptoms one week ago exactly and tested positive. So about every other night, I get the most insane GI issues. My stomach bloats up like a balloon, I get body aches, I have trapped gas and insomnia as a result. My stomach has like intense hunger pain kind of feeling but i know it’s not really hunger pains. I have almost no appetite in part due to loss of taste and smell, but I still make sure I eat. I just wanted to know if anyone else experienced this, how long it lasted for you, any advice?

Need advice	Am I being overly cautious? The concern above contracting COVID has turned me into a person who is afraid to go anywhere. I am in that age range who is susceptible and I have a husband with underlying issues. I go out once a week to pick up groceries (they bring them to my car) I am concerned about contracting this virus and also passing it on to my husband. I want to visit my grandchildren. I have seen them from a distance and video calls from my daughter in law who I also want to spend time with. should just go and whatever happens happens.

When can you stop isolating? Got some confusing answers from the nurse line today.	20F, just found out this morning I tested positive. I was tested on the June 27th, which is also the same day I started having any symptoms (a fever). Besides fatigue, most of my symptoms disappeared between the 28th and the 1st. Thursday I started having chest pain and mild shortness of breath. I can feel a cough coming on and my headache is back too. This morning I woke up with a fever which I hadn't had since the day I got tested. The nurse who called to tell me I tested positive asked me when I started feeling sick and I tried to explain what I said above. She told me I could stop isolating on Monday the 6th, but this seems too early from everything I've read? If true that's great, but I don't want to put anyone else at risk if I go out too soon	When can you stop isolating?

Does anyone taste bleach in fruit and vegetables?	My (22F) only two symptoms are minor itchy throat, shortness of breath/chest tightness for 8 days. The feelings last a few hours and then go for a few hours. I can still taste and smell, but I have tasted some sort of bleach flavor in some things (cucumbers, green apples, oranges...) I have chronic lyme that has affected my nervous system pretty severely in the past 8 months, so it's hard to tell if it's just my chronic illness, since it also gives me the chest tightness and sore throat sometimes.

18F, obese, otherwise relatively healthy	Hi guys, So I had a brother come from New York about a week ago, but he’s had no symptoms and was cautious on the way here. Of late, I’ve had tickles in my throat that makes me cough, feels like there’s a lump in my throat, I’ve been breathing deeply since I’m genuinely afraid but of late breathing makes my chest and back ache. Aside from that everything else is fine, no fever, no congestion, and can still taste and smell. Is it anxiety or should I be concerned? Thanks!!	18F, obese, otherwise relatively healthy Hi guys, So I had a brother come from New York about a week ago, but he’s had no symptoms and was cautious on the way here.

Husband tested positive after symptoms, notified his boss, and now he's getting texts from coworkers asking if he has COVID-19.	He got tested and notified his boss. Boss called and said he is the first employee to get a positive result and they need to discuss protocols with each other and come up with a plan on Monday. She asked if he gave her HIPAA permission to use his name to discuss with HR and a few other senior staff about what can be done. He gave her permission to use his name among those four people. They had to notify his site manager about one of her employees (my husband), and that she had to notify her other employees who were in contact with my husband to get tested. Well, I'm not sure what was said to these employees, but why are people assuming it's him? Can they get into trouble for this?

Wondering if I may have recently contracted COVID	M/32- Had a slight scratchy through the last week but marked it up to allergies because mine are always terrible this time of year. Ive been working in my home office and about mid day I starting getting really achey lower back pain, similar to how the flu aches fell. I just checked my temperature (ear thermometer) out of curiosity and came up 99.1, 100.1, 99.8. Not sure if that counts. Im tired but I have 2 young toddlers so Im always tired. Just feel overall blah. I haven't really reached a threshold that I would consider getting tested as I dont want to inadvertently infect anyone else.

Questions on disinfecting surfaces for covid?	"I have some lysol cleaning wipes. They don't explicity say covid-2 but they are lysol dual action scrub wipes. They also say human coronavirus. &amp;#x200B; The instructions also state you need to let it sit 4 full minutes on a surface, and wet, for it to ""disinfect"". That's impossible. They don't come with a tub of extra stuff to keep things wet, and anything in any location will dry after one minute. &amp;#x200B; SO, i went to mcdonalds, and the employee had to touch my phone for a coupon. I came home freaked out. I grabbed the lysol wipes and wiped down all my phone and phone screen. I let it sit for around 3 minutes or so. After about one minute, the surface mostly dried. &amp;#x200B; The instructions say FOUR minutes, and to keep the surface wet for 4 minutes. I didn't do this.

Super fatigue, brain fog, clammy hands and feet, headache here and there, had a fever of 99.3F only one day. Chest tightness that never turned into a cough, though it constantly felt like I needed to. Random heart palpitations, one that woke me up from a dead sleep. Random flank pain. With all of this, I thought, do I have anxiety now or something?! Well March 29 my live-in gf started showing symptoms and got it way worse. Bad deep dry cough, fatigue, brain fog, tunnel vision, SOB that made it hard to get to the bathroom. Fevers. That lasted for about 4 weeks. Her dr ultimately diagnosed with covid after looking at her chest x rays. Got a test, and of course it was negative. Useless. Both of us have had waves of recurring symptoms.

Altered sense of taste/smell AFTER recovery?	My husband and I both has a loss of taste and smell back in April (they wouldn't test us as that was our only symptom but another person in our house tested positive at the same time). We recovered these senses within a few weeks but since, we've had some alterations in smells and tastes. For instance, he often says things smell like hot metal or iron, and when he drinks sweet tea, no matter the brand, it tastes like dish water. I often smell what I can only describe as a canister of onion powder. Has anyone else noticed a change in your baseline olfactory function?	Altered sense of taste/smell AFTER recovery?

I hope to at least make the reception"" but the wedding is tomorrow and I am supposed to leave for it today. I do not want to be exposed to the virus because the bride has her bride-blinders on and doesn't see the virus as a threat.

I've been kept out of the loop other than ""I tested positive after getting tested for peace of mind and only have mild symptoms - we are deciding what to do and will keep you posted. I hope to at least make the reception"" but the wedding is tomorrow and I am supposed to leave for it today. I do not want to be exposed to the virus because the bride has her bride-blinders on and doesn't see the virus as a threat. Does anyone have any advice/suggestions about: \- how to handle this with the bride? \- how to console them? \- ???!??! (I'm at a loss for words in case you wouldn't tell)"	2
Chest sore to the touch with chest tightness and nausea	Has anyone with covid experienced a chest that is sore to the touch and has stabbing pains? I’m not sure if I have covid or not but I’ve been having a lot of worrisome symptoms for the last few days. When I walk for a long time I get winded easily. I went for a long walk today and when I got back I was super nauseous and 4 hours later I still feel like I’m going to throw up. It is miserable. I sat up in bed and hunched over, and when I returned to a normal sitting position, I had an extreme pain all over my chest and it has been sore to the touch all day, and had gotten worse after my walk. My chest feels so tight and I feel like I can’t get a 100% full deep breath. I don’t really have any other symptoms besides those and a bit of dizziness if I walk for too long. The chest is sore to the touch starting in the middle, and goes all the way across the left side of my chest and stops behind my left armpit.

Anyone from the Springfield VA area? What happened at Greenspring?

Squeezing feeling in chest?	Today I’ve been having some weird symptoms. I keep getting stabbing pains in my legs that start in my calf and go all the way up to my groin area. When I’m walking around, my legs will frequently go numb and have a prickly feeling all over them. But the most concerning symptom is the feeling of someone squeezing or flicking the inside of my chest. This feeling doesn’t hurt but it causes a weird sensation of pins and needles from the left/middle part of my chest, up to my throat. I also keep experiencing left arm pain after it happens. Has anyone experienced any of these symptoms? It’s been weird.	Squeezing feeling in chest? Today I’ve been having some weird symptoms.

Too soon to test?	So yesterday at the end of the day I got a horrible headache, and I don’t usually get headaches. Today I haven’t had a bad headache (it comes and goes), but I’ve had body aches in my joints, fever (100.8), fatigue and chills. I’ve had some intermittent chest pain, no real cough and no shortness of breath. I’m a 32 year old female and don’t exercise regularly, especially since I have an almost 4 year old and 12 week old in addition to usually working 45+ hour weeks. I work in a health-related profession and just went back to work on 6/8 (lockdown was eased up in my state and my maternity leave ended). We screen patients on the phone, asking if anyone has symptoms or has been in contact with someone sick and don’t schedule appointments if they have symptoms. We also disinfect using the N-grade disinfectant after every patient... we don’t take temperatures, though, and people frequently wear the masks wrong (not covering their noses) or remove their masks for part of their appointments. I had a gentleman who literally sounded like he was hacking up a lung for most of the appointment... his wife just shrugged it	Too soon to test?

Tested Positive yesterday	"Found out Thursday I needed a clean COVID test to work a Basketball camp. Got tested Friday. Found out positive today (Saturday). Previously, my wife got tested a month+ ago and was negative (for contact tracking). Daughter got tested for strep 2 weeks ago, was negative, tested her for COVID same time, also negative. How often are there false positives? What can I expect? Should I have symptoms by now? My test was an ""RNA PCR"" test. I have no symptoms (yet)."

29 days - keeps coming back	As the title says... I've been living with symptoms ranging from severe pneumonia to now what seems neurological issues. Current Issues: - Balance - Memory - Huge fatigue levels - Concentration - Still having a huge fever every 12 hours or so. Seems to focus in my core and head. - Sinuses feel horrible Started out mild. Day 10-18 peaked with the severe trouble breathing, organ pains, heart palpitations. I'm now concerned this virus is somewhat Herpes or AIDS like in that it hides out in my spine. I could feel the nerves in my spine tingle 2 weeks back as if it went in there. It's fucking horrific if this is the case. Anyone else now at 25+ days and living the same situation?	29 days - keeps coming back As the title says...

When can I see my family in my home?	I had a negative test, but the covid screening place said based on my symptoms it’s very likely I have the virus. I’ve been symptomatic for three weeks - I’m locked in a bedroom while my husband cares for our three children and myself. He prepares all of our meals/laundry/ etc and handles everyone’s needs. We’ve been living this way for close to three weeks. I haven’t had a fever this entire time, so I’m not sure when it’s safe to come out and interact with my family. I’m extremely fatigued, and my symptoms vary day to day, so whenever I think I’m in the clear, something new pops up. I live in the US, so I won’t be able to get a test to clear me, and since my last test was a false negative I don’t even know if it’s worth it. TL/DR I can’t find any clear information: how soon can I reassimilate into my general household activities to help my husband with our kiddos? I still feel shitty but I never had a fever so I can’t really use that as a gauge.	When can I see my family in my home?

Burning/Tightness in Chest	Hi all. 26yo Male here. I am a former smoker (quit in October thank God), but otherwise in good health. I have no allergies, but I do have GERD (reflux), however, so it's possible my symptoms could be from that, as well as anxiety. For the past 5 or six days I have been having some tightness or mild burning in my chest, primarily closer to my ribs. It is petty much constant, but sometimes feels worse depending on position. It improves when I go for a walk or take a hot bath/shower. I also had swollen lymph nodes for a couple days, as well as a swollen, but not sore, throat, but those went away pretty quickly. I have also had some GI issues, but those are pretty similar to problems I've had in the past. I have noticed that many on here have had similar mild symptoms--has anyone who has tested positive had similar symptoms? Did they take a turn for the worse? Thank You!

Tested positive for antibodies. Why do I still have symptoms 59 days in?	So I just got my results for my antibody test and it came back positive. They only tested for IGG. I thought it would be negative since I'm still having symptoms. If I have antibodies, why do I still have symptoms? How is it that the antibodies have not killed the virus by now? Sorry if it's a stupid question. I would love to give plasma and help save some lives...but I guess I would have to wait until I'm completely symptom free?	Tested positive for antibodies.

How long is this gonna go on for??	I became symptomatic on the 19th of March. I had a week of “bad” illness and then started recovering. It’s been 19 days and my fever just won’t go away. It’s been low the whole time, between 99 and 100.0, but it’s been persistent, even long after my other symptoms went away. I want to go back to work. Any one else dragging this out internally?

Long Termers : I was presumed coronavirus positive in March - Keep having relapses - Just found out my antibody test is negative...?	I don't know what to say. I've been very sick from coronavirus and my symptoms match so many other people who have been experiencing inflamation, vein, &amp; heart issues. If I push myself even the tiniest bit, I have a relapse for a week or more. However my antibody test just came back negative. WTH? Is this why I keep relapsing because my body is not successful creating antibodies to fight this off or it hasn't been long enough at over 2 months or is the test unreliable?

Did any of you experience breathing issues as your ONLY symptom?	Since beginning of April I have had shortness of breath, burning lung sensation when I inhale or exhale, and tightness in throat and chest. The most bothersome is the intense burning feeling when I breathe. Docs say it’s either asthma or inflammation in my lungs caused by allergies or an irritant. Nothing they prescribed seems to help make it subside. I’ve never had lung issues until now. It comes and goes but is present most days.

Ice pick headaches	I became ill in mid-March. I suspect it was covid, but was not able to get tested until two months after my symptoms started. I didn't expect to still be positive after so long (despite still having symptoms), and my test did come back negative, but I do believe it was covid and will try to get antibody testing when I can. In any case, I'm curious if those who've tested positive have experienced anything similar to what I've been going through. Have any of you had ice pick headaches (or primary stabbing headaches), during the illness, or after? An ice pick headache feels exactly how you would imagine--sudden sharp stabbing pains (periodic, not persistent pain). Mine occur above my left brow, but I believe they can occur elsewhere. I know headaches are associated with covid, but ice pick headaches have some connection to autoimmune disorders. It seems a bit odd to me that I've been experiencing this now with such frequency after being ill. I've had ice pick headaches before in my life, but only a handful of times, and none lasting more than a day. My current headache has lasted 4 or 5 days.	Ice pick headaches I became ill in mid-March.

Anybody think they caught covid outdoors?	I know its supposed to be much more difficult to catch while outdoors... but does anybody here think they got it outside? What were the circumstances? I've only left my studio apartment twice since mid march and really wanted some time outside. Drove a couple hours to hike at a state park and the thin trails were super crowded with very few people wearing masks. Other than just being disappointed in everyone I'm slightly nervous.

Smokers who tested positive - how to satisfy your nicotine addiction while infected?	I tested positive a week ago and I barely have any symptoms (the only reason I was tested is because my coworkers got infected, otherwise I would've never known). The only symptom is that I cough for an hour after I smoke a cigarette (or even a strong perfume or some dust). Since I want to avoid pneumonia, but it's also unbearable for me not to smoke at least one ciggy per day, I would like to somehow find an alternative to cigarettes or to smoke less often. How did you get by? Did you manage to even quit smoking?	Smokers who tested positive - how to satisfy your nicotine addiction while infected?

Only 22 and this hit me worse than any pain Iv ever had.	Cracked my skull open multiple times, ripped my hands open, have had heatstroke and fallen off a cliff into a thorn bush. Not gonna go through a whole list but wow I was not expecting this. My fever bounces up to 103 every night and going to use the bathroom I need to take 15 minute rests on each time to get some air in. My breaths are essentially doubled and it feels sometimes like someone vacuum sealed my lungs and than punched me in the chest. First 3 days I vomited over 30+ times and I’m 8 days in still waiting to be able to wake up without vomiting(even on anti nausea medication).

Only 22 and this hit me worse than any pain Iv ever had. Cracked my skull open multiple times, ripped my hands open, have had heatstroke and fallen off a cliff into a thorn bush. Not gonna go through a whole list but wow I was not expecting this. My fever bounces up to 103 every night and going to use the bathroom I need to take 15 minute rests on each time to get some air in. My breaths are essentially doubled and it feels sometimes like someone vacuum sealed my lungs and than punched me in the chest. First 3 days I vomited over 30+ times and I’m 8 days in still waiting to be able to wake up without vomiting(even on anti nausea medication).

Fatigue after COVID?	Hello so I’ve been presumed positive of the virus back in march and I had a somewhat mild case. However I have found that since I am still suffering from tiredness. I have some days where I am perfectly fine then I have days where I’m just completely tired and just need to rest. I’ve literally been on the phone to my doctor to arrange bloods to see if it’s something else but she did tell me a lot of people who have had cases tend to have tiredness months after. So my question is has anyone had a somewhat mild case and found themselves with the fatigue? If so do you still have it? When did it wear off for you? Thanks for all the help Ps here’s my symptoms It started out with a bad stomach ache and extreme fatigue which I was thought due to a tattoo session and then I ended up waking up in the night with a fever and I got a horrid dry cough, my throat was on fire and my muscles and body was aching like hell.

Second Opinion Please	Hey all! So, I know all of you aren't a replacement for a doctor. I was just thinking about getting a second opinion to see if I'm crazy. I haven't really been keeping up with everything super close. I've just been quarantining and working from home. I'm home from college, it's just me and my mom, and I'm \~25 and she's \~60. Neither of us get sick very often. I have seasonal allergies. If I ever get a cold or allergies the only thing I deal with is a runny nose &amp; congestion. Very, very rarely do I ever get a cough along with it. I do not have anything going on with my sinuses. I came in contact with a younger cousin that was off of work due to having a fever and shooting pain in her ribs. She was better in the next couple days and let go back to work. March 16th. I washed my hands and clothes. I washed everything I touched just to be safe. On the 22nd her and I both woke up with sore throats that seemed to last most of the day. They were gone the following day. She hasn't had anything	Second Opinion Please Hey all! So, I know all of you aren't a replacement for a doctor.

What now?	Hey y’all, Finding this sub is helpful. Have been getting tested every month or so because my city has made it really easy to do so. Got my (29 F) results back on Friday and am positive. I was having headache/sinus issues for a few days but thought it was from all the smoke. Yesterday I had really awful body aches, sore throat, stuffy nose, and no energy. Felt the same today but the aches are now localized in one place. Thermometers have been sold out everywhere so I have no idea if I have had a fever (felt like maybe yesterday with hot colds).

Covid Cough help	Started having symptoms on Sunday 6/28. Body ache, headache, nausea- brushed it off to being dehydrated. Got home and laid down and the chills came, intense headache, body ache. Slept for the next day, finally was able to get tested on Wednesday. By Wednesday I felt a lot better. Felt like I could go back out to work and continue my normal routine. (I didn’t) By Wednesday lost my smell and taste and that when I figured it had to be Covid. I had no real issues the past few days, was feeling good but today the chills came and body ache. I also noticed I have been coughing a bit more and constantly phlemy. Feel slight SOB, but I’m still able to get a few good deep breathes in. So my question is: did anyone else develop the SOB and cough/ phlem later on after they have had Covid? Any suggestions on ways to control my breathing and keeping my cough to a minimum? Been taking Vitamin C &amp; D and zinc. I think it has helped my symptoms. Any other supplements or ideas to overcome this is welcomed. Thanks. Sorry, for formatting and wording.

Trying to stay calm	The health department hasn’t really been informative when contacting me after testing positive about quarantine and what to expect 😔 and my anxiety is going crazy. Do I quarantine from the day my results are positive, last day of my fever, or first day of symptoms. I asked what to expect to feel/experience and they told me there were too many unknowns with the virus and couldn’t tell me. One lady did say if I was indeed on day 5 and wasn’t having any respiratory issues so far I probably would be okay but she couldn’t be for certain. I’m concerned maybe I had strep and then caught the positive early and I’m awaiting covid symptoms still? Maybe I’m just thinking too much. I’m angry and upset as we’ve (myself, husband, toddler) taken all precautions possible to avoid catching this. I’m pretty sure I know how I got it which upsets me even more which I’ll explain in a moment. Before I start for clarification, my husband, toddler, and myself currently live with both my parents and my (20) yr old sibling.

Post-covid recovery damage? (Blood pressure/cholesterol)	So I tested positive for the antibodies about a month ago and had covid back in April. I didn’t have it too bad aside from slight breathing issues and loss of smell. Post covid for a couple weeks I had a couple normal cuts get infected but I’m good now (I’m assuming my immune system was still hyperactive). I went to the doctor to get a checkup and apparently my blood pressure was at ~132/76 and my cholesterol was 280+ and LDL was 190+. Prior to covid I never had these issues. I’m just posting on here to get an idea if anyone else had anything similar happen to them and if I should expect this to be permanent or if I’ll eventually recover. I’m in my mid 20’s and I exercise regularly and diet is pretty good (pretty much just eat fish, chicken, whole grains, etc.) I’ve also been sober since March if that helps.

Anyone here have a good idea that they caught COVID from outdoor activities?	Full disclosure - I am not positive. I have only left my house and saw people outside of my house once since mid March because I’m scared to death of this virus. Obviously - this is beginning to take a negative toll on my mental health and I’m starting to consider doing a couple (hopefully low risk) activities outside my house to keep me from being too depressed. One of those activities is hiking at a local nature center. I admittedly know nothing about the transmission of the virus in outdoor environments - but I wanted to see if anyone here is pretty sure they caught it by going outdoors and doing things?

I've been searching medical literature and cannot seem to find anything similar. Does anybody have the same thing and if so how much time did it took to resolve? I also have anosmia and ageusia (can't smell or taste anything) but that seems to be a lot more common and supposedly it lasts for up to 2-3 weeks in most cases.

Just got home from hospital. Question about O2 levels dropping when walking and heart rate jumping up. How long does this last...	I was sent to the ER today (tested Monday and positive came back Wednesday.) I went for shortness of breath and breathlessness, chest and back pain... the COVID buffet!!! Anyway, my lungs were clear, my 02 was mostly 98, my chest X-ray was clear... but the doctor had me get up and walk around and my 02 levels tanked to 91-92 every time and my heart rate goes to 120-140. Same when I’d run out of breath while talking to her. She said that is obviously not normal for a healthy 35-yr old who runs and lifts weights with no health problems, but it was something they were seeing with some COVID patients. She ordered a CT scan with contrast to make sure I wasn’t having a Pulmonary Embolism or I had pneumonia or fluid the X-ray didn’t catch. Nope. CT was clear and perfect. Bloodwork was perfection. She was on the verge of keeping me but decided to let me go home after the CT was clean and my 02 levels are fine just sitting there. My question is: how many of you have had this and how long does it take to go away? I’m obviously freaked out.	Just got home from hospital.

Chest Pain with Allergy Like Symptoms	Hi all, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post my question. Over the last week or so, I’ve had a very itchy throat, an occasional runny nose (usually at night and in the morning), and a dry cough that lasted half a day. These symptoms were not severe and usually subsided throughout the day. I figured it was just my seasonal allergies acting up. However, today I’ve been having weird chest pains. The pains move around from side to side but are usually in the middle of my chest. It kind of feels like a burning in the middle of my chest and occasional twinges of pain on the sides. I don’t have any trouble breathing. This made me think of the possibility of having COVID. I’ve barely been around anyone other than grocery shopping. I do have very bad health anxiety. Could this chest pain be from anxiety? Or should I get tested? Thank you in advance for replies!

Over the last week or so, I’ve had a very itchy throat, an occasional runny nose (usually at night and in the morning), and a dry cough that lasted half a day. These symptoms were not severe and usually subsided throughout the day. I figured it was just my seasonal allergies acting up. However, today I’ve been having weird chest pains. The pains move around from side to side but are usually in the middle of my chest. It kind of feels like a burning in the middle of my chest and occasional twinges of pain on the sides. I don’t have any trouble breathing. This made me think of the possibility of having COVID. I’ve barely been around anyone other than grocery shopping. I do have very bad health anxiety. Could this chest pain be from anxiety? Or should I get tested? Thank you in advance for replies!	0

Tested postive, but rather confused! I have no fever and still have all my senses. When does this go downhill!?!	"On Thursday(June 18th), I had what I considered a pretty run-of-the-mill allergy/asthma attack. I'm very allergic to grass and Thursdays grass pollen count was very high. I woke up with a headache, short of breath (I have asthma set off by exercise, allergens, and smells but its well controlled via regular exercise, OTC meds, and a rescue inhaler I haven't touched in years), also had sinus pain and a sore throat, I was tired, but I had gone back to work this last week which means 5:10am wakeup instead of 7:30am. So I expected to feel a bit sluggish this week. Took my temp 3x as I do twice a day, no fever, and went to work! I took my ""bad day"" allergy meds (psuedoephedrine) and took my inhaler regularly to be safe. Left work early, took a 2hr nap, felt much better, but went through a drive-up Covid-19 test site just to be extra cautious.

Waiting on test results - weird symptoms	Some background - 24m, former serious weight lifter, mostly healthy all my life. I work in an office and have been made to come in to the office in person since the beginning of June. I was there until halfway through July when I was told to work from home for two weeks. I started noticing something was off on my first day back after being remote for two weeks. Timeline: Monday 8/3 - Started noticing fatigue, almost falling asleep at my desk with no ability to focus on anything, brain fog maybe? felt very cold all day, I chocked this up to trouble sleeping Tuesday 8/4 - Same coldness, started wearing warmer clothes, fatigue was worse and genuinely couldn't concentrate on anything. Up until this point, no other symptoms Wednesday 8/5 - Woke up with bad congestion, and decided to work from home. Same coldness and fatigue/brain fog, it got to the point in the middle of the day that it was a genuine effort to read and understand emails. Congestion went away within an hour or two, but I take adderall for ADD so I really can't be sure if that isn't just clearing up my congestion.

Prednisone question	Hello, I wanted to ask a question to those who got it, how much did prednisone help? I talked to a teledoc who set me on a taper schedule of 60mg to start and decreasing by 10 every two day’s to help with some breathlessness and chest aches she thinks is early stage pleurisy. I talked to her about the immunosuppressive part of it but she wasn’t worried since it was such a low dose but I didn’t want to make things worse in case I do have a mild case. Any precautions, I do walk a lot each day so it doesn’t affect my movement much, maybe I’m just a little more breathless than normal and I get chest aches that get worse when I exercise, that’s why she put me on it.

False Positive?	So I just tested negative for covid19. I got tested Thursday. My symptoms are getting worse. I came into the Dr on Thursday due to: shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, trouble breathing and severe diarrhea. I feel worse and now have mild body aches and a bad headache. They COVID tested me and X-rayed my chest. They said I have pneumonia ...got Flovent and Albuterol. They said I still have a temp of 99.7 and low oxygen level of 95%. I'm on antibiotics too because the Dr doesn't know if it's bacterial or not. I still feel very weak. Can't keep food down. Still having low oxygen and everything. I don't have energy to shower. I am 30 and healthy and have no underlying diseases. I had the flu shot on 9/8. I got symptoms on 9/16....pneumonia is caused by viruses and bacteria.

My partner’s coworker tested positive	I have a new girlfriend that I see almost every week and she works in the food industry where the other dish washer has tested positive (she’s a dish washer so they work very closely.) They have not shut down the restaurant which is crazy but she decided we probably shouldn’t see each other for about 2 weeks. I haven’t seen her since last Friday. So about a week and a few days. We do not kiss due to Covid or share drinks. We also both see another guy who is in the at risk group. She kisses him but I don’t kiss either of them. We got drunk last Friday and dude accidentally drank my beer and let me finish it but never told me until today. I was at his house today when she texted us about it.

Melatonin and Caffeine?	So, I've been hearing a lot about studies that are supplementing melatonin for Covid-19, and the theory that children's high melatonin levels may partially explain how they're not as affected by the virus. This makes me wonder if there could be a link between caffeine consumption and severity of illness, since it's been shown that caffeine consumption is negatively correlated with melatonin production in the body - And that lifetime caffeine consumption is associated with a smaller pineal gland, which is a primary producer of melatonin. Does my theory have any merit? Is there any evidence that high caffeine consumers may be getting hit harder by the virus?	Melatonin and Caffeine?

Insight from a victim of bacterial pneumonia	"Do you have pneumonia caused directly or indirectly by the virus? If so, I have some anecdotal experience that may help you both mentally and physically. The more I read about this virus, the more I realize it can closely resemble a case of bacterial pneumonia I had some years ago. I think that sharing my experience might give victims some comfort, so here goes: 1. It came and went. I'm talking about literal hours. In the morning I could be fine. By noon, I'd crash with a fever again. I could go from feeling relatively normal to having crippling fatigue and a high fever sometimes two or three times in one day. Why the human immune system fights lung infections in this way, I have no idea - but the coronavirus is not alone in this erratic immuno response (based on my experience). 2. Exercising or doing anything strenuous was nearly impossible during crashes, but tempting during brief recoveries. When your immune system is fighting, the worst thing you can do is try to exercise, because you're probably in an ""eye of the storm"". Don't jog or bike. Don't even try to go on long walks.

Fever of 38°(over 100°) for over a week and a worsening interstitial pneumonia. Will my dad get better anytime soon?	My dad (age 57 with controlled hypertension, no other chronic diseases, BMI of 30, on and off smoker for years) got tested positive for COVID-19 on the 9th of September with a fever of 37,8°. He chose to be admitted into hospital, as to avoid getting me and my mom sick (but both of us eventually also got sick). The same day they did an X-ray on him showing an unilateral pneumonia with typical for covid-19 ground glass opacity. They immediately started him on 2 antibiotics - Cefepime, Levofloxacin; Dexamethasone (steroid), Fraxiparine (anticoagulant), vitamin C and zinc are also added to his treatment, following the most recent guidelines. Somewhere along the line he's started having a cough and feeling a heaviness in his chest. Fatigue is also obvious to be experienced with his fever. On the 14th of September (6 days of treatment) he got another X-ray, which showed that the lung damage has spread. Since this points at an unsuccessful treatment so far, they switched up the Cefepime with Meropenem. Unfortunately, the new antibiotic still doesn't help - his fever won't budge, nor does the cough. We're all getting progressively more worried... TL;DR My dad's been having severe symptoms	Fever of 38°(over 100°) for over a week and a worsening interstitial pneumonia.

Sex with someone thats tested positive...?

Just tested positive	So I (22M) was with some of my friends in a car on Sunday night for 2/3 hours (none of us had really been outside our homes much). Yesterday morning one of my friends said a person he had been in close contact with last week tested positive. We all got tested last night and are positive and I just want to ask people about their experiences. I have no underlying health conditions but I have pretty bad anxiety and since testing positive I'm kinda freaking out about how bad it might get. I know the vast majority get mildly sick, or fairly sick but still make a full recovery. Its still hard not to be scared since there is no real treatment, you always see the horror stories of people on ventilators or suffering greatly and its impossible to keep that out of my mind at the moment. No real symptoms just feel kind of sickly, I feel my anxiety is playing up any feelings of illness I get aswell. For extra context I smoke socially (when drinking) but I'm far from a pack a day type smoker (I know any level of smoking is bad).

I ordered pedialyte, vitamin C and D, blue listerine, and an oximeter. I also have a bedside humidifier, extra strength Tylenol, and robitussin. Is robitussin okay to take for Covid? Is there anything we should do or avoid?	Is there anything I should do or take if Covid positive? I strongly suspect my husband and I both have Covid.

Those who tested positive then negative, what was the timeframe of your illness and how long did you wait?	I had an extremely mild case and was positive by mid April. Only lost my senses and recovered it a week after. No symptoms since, it’s been a full 2 weeks. I have my second test tomorrow. My case only lasted for the 2 weeks period. I don’t know how to feel if I test positive again with no symptoms. Has anyone even tested positive then negative here? Did you wait for a long time? I thought maybe since I had such a mild case, that I’ll be negative but then there’s talk about “dead virus cells” still in there. I don’t know how to clear myself.

My body after COVID	\*TRIGGER WARNING\* This is my story. Back in August wildfires lit up the west coast. I awoke at 1:32 am wheezing and gasping for air. I discovered in the hours to come that the smoke had descended upon Seattle. After days of wheezing the tele-doc told me to take allergy meds and provided an inhaler. In the following weeks, I survived on the inhaler and my voice was occasionally raspy and occasionally gone. One morning I woke up and collapsed. I spent the following days curled up on my apartment floor writhing in pain and vomiting. It felt like all of my organs were having muscle spasms. I had stabbing pain in my stomach. When I tried to lie down it felt like an elephant on my chest. My body is covered in bruises (if I touch my arm it will bruise.) I sleep 2-3 hours a night. Another wonderful side effect is memory loss. When I started choking and vomiting at the same time for an hour at a time I knew I needed to get into a doctor. When I went into urgent care the physician took my entire story over the past weeks and got very quiet.	My body after COVID \*TRIGGER WARNING\* This is my story.

Is it possible that this is an immune response that is ongoing?	I’m sure this has been discussed before but I read that Symptoms after the virus has cleared is an overzealous reaction by the immune system. Does this mean that it will never calm down? I tested negative a few times and still dealing with different symptoms. Not severe but very bothersome. Hope all are doing well.	Is it possible that this is an immune response that is ongoing?

Questions And Concerns	Hey everyone. So, around April 15-18 I can’t remember when to be honest I tested positive for Covid-19. I was surprised, my grandma tested positive and I live with her (She did not make it). Everyone in my house hold tested positive in fact, including my pregnant mother. This is all besides the point, can I get it again? What’s the research behind it. For some additional info, after OVER a month of self isolating I decided to get retested. My results were lost by the health department (go figure) because when I called for my results hey couldn’t find them and they presumed I was negative because If it was positive they would’ve called me by now. Sure okay, I get that logic whatever I guess (thought unprofessional if you ask me). A couple of days pass (3 days) and I’m ready to get back to running my errands for my mom as we need stuff to live. I’m still extremely anxious to leave my house I don’t want to harm anyone especially after seeing what it did to my grandma and I demanded for the health department to locate my 2nd set of results.

Don't know if its Covid related but the timing is suspect (enlarged tonsil)	I got pretty sick around end of March/beginning of April, while I got through the actual sickness in a few days, the myriad of lingering symptoms were what really worried me. I still have lung rattling to this day (it's slooooowly getting better), but I've also notices since around getting sick I've had a feeling of a dry throat, well turns out the dry throat is actually my right tonsil enlarged to the point of giving the sensation of having a dry throat or something stuck in it, this is not anything I really ever noticed prior to having Covid19, it's completely painless btw, wondering if anybody has had similar experiences??? Should also mention I tested positive for antibodies ...

Right side chest pain	So today I (19M) started to feel pain on the right sode of my chest, more specifically, just to the left of my right shoulder. It's not a severe pain, but it hurts when I breathe deeply, and when I try to lay down I can sort of hear/feel a crack on that area, just beneath the skin. I googled it and apparently that's one of the most dangerous covid-19 symptoms, and I should seek a doctor immediatly. I never had any other symptom, no fever, no chill, I was full of energy the whole week, I was actually able to workout on my room with no problem. I do have a weird thing going on with my stomach where some foods are making me feel full quickly, my mother suspects that to be gastritis and I'm already taking medication for it, though it's not working as weell as it should. I googled it again, surprise surpirse, an upset stomach might also be a symptom of covid-19 My mom says I'm being paranoid, do you think I should get tested?

Reinfection after recovery? Sick for 10 days in March, Tested Positive for Antibodies in April. Got Tested Monday, Tested POSITIVE for COVID and NEGATIVE for antibodies???	Like the title says, I got sick early in shutdown days (mildly) and was tested for a medical study early in April, the antibody test where they actually count the number of antibodies (I got 960). I then donated convalescent plasma and the plasma center informed me again that the plasma donation tested positive for antibodies and invited me to donate again, which I did. Cut to this week. I have to get a nasal swab for work. It's my first nasal swab and it comes back positive for COVID! And negative for antibodies! I can understand the antibody levels going down over time, but it hasn't been very long. I'm more shocked by the nasal swab results. For what it's worth, I feel 100% normal. I know there were early claims of people getting infected twice, but I thought those were dismissed as testing error. I called the testing center, CityMD in New York, and she said that because this was my first nasal swab, I might have just had COVID this entire time, and that it wasn't necessarily a reinfection. I forgot to ask why, if I still had an active infection, would my body stop producing antibodies.	Reinfection after recovery? Sick for 10 days in March, Tested Positive for Antibodies in April.

Do these mild symptoms sound familiar to anyone who tested positive?	On the evening of Sunday April 5 I started feeing like I had a sickness coming on with mild fatigue and a “tickle” in my throat. I chalked it up to allergies because I did some yard work during the day The next day Monday April 6 I woke up feeling the same way. I also had some diarrhea. Over the next few days I felt a slight tightness in my chest, a tickle in my throat that made me want to cough but I could easy suppress the urge to cough. Wednesday was the peak of my fatigue, though I wouldn’t call it “extreme”, just generalized tiredness, my arms and legs felt like noodles, and some muscle soreness in my legs and back. I could perform chores around my house but it took a lot out of me. On Thursday night I a headache woke me up from my sleep and I typically don’t get headaches. Today, Saturday, would be day 7.

I've tested negative, but has anyone tested positive with a similar experience?	Hi, since Friday the 10th of July I've felt weird. I've had the following symptoms: feeling hot one moment and freezing the next, mild fatigue, mild headaches, mild lethargy/dizziness and my stomach has felt upset. On the 12th I took a swab test, following an email from the UK's Covid-19 app, which came back unclear. The following day I took another swab test which came back negative. Tuesday 14th I felt like I was a little better but yesterday, the 15th, my stomach felt really painful and I had several bouts of diarrhoea to the point where only bile was being expelled. Aside from that I didn't feel too bad. Today my stomach has gone back to being just a little upset but the lethargy and mild headache has returned. Within the past hour I've coughed a little bit, but no more than you would after being in a dusty room for awhile. I'm not so worried about myself, but my partner has asthma and I'm concerned of spreading it to colleagues/clients at work (the majority of our clients are 65+) I haven't even felt that unwell, but the symptoms are so weird.

Could I have it again?	I had corona on May 27th, quarantined for 2 weeks, and then went out after I quarantined (to see friends; the store; etc). I tested negative on June 24th.

I have seen her between June 15th and now. Today I feel like I did when I first had it. Could I have it again or am I just having post viral symptoms?

Psoriasis/eczema and covid	Hey So I have a very mild form of eczema and psoriasis, and also very very mild vitiligo that's appeared over the last year. They're all autoimmune disorders of the skin and I was just wondering does anyone know what the deal is with these and covid? Has anyone with any of these had covid? I've tried to find studies to see if it increases the risk but seems like nothing out there atm. A LOT my friends have had it and been fine since (except for one doctor friend who got it very badly, but the only lingering symptom is her loss of smell 5 months on) so although I've always been very careful not to catch it, I've never let it stress me too much as I'm young and healthy with an otherwise good immune system. But then I read that autommine diseases seem to be what cause the serious reactions and I'm suddenly worrying whether these autoimmune skin conditions could have this affect too. Anyone have any info on this?	Psoriasis/eczema and covid Hey So I have a very mild form of eczema and psoriasis, and also very very mild vitiligo that's appeared over the last year.

anyone go to the ER with shortness of breath and discharged but worried that you might have inhaled a lot of the virus and made it worse??	29/M O+ I've been experiencing continuous shortness of breath since March 21tst, with some low grade fever and chills and night sweats at the very beginning. The fever went away, but the breathing difficulty has remained. A doctors visit on the 26th confirmed it was not asthma and almost certainly covid19. My inhaler has't been doing anything but jacking up my heart rate. He sent me home and told me to just tough it out, that my lungs sounded clear, and I didn't need to go to the ER unless my breathing got much worse. Well, fast forward to midday the 27th, and I feel like I can barely breathe, and I'm lightheaded and gasping for breath walking around. A telehealth check-in with a doctor lasted about 1 minute, the doctor told me to go to the ER. So in I went, to Elmhurst hospital in Queens. When I was brought in, it was basically a room full of people intubated with oxygen and people coughing. I waited in a chair trying to face away from people as much as possible. After about 2 hours, I was given a chest x-ray and an ekg and both came back clear.

He sent me home and told me to just tough it out, that my lungs sounded clear, and I didn't need to go to the ER unless my breathing got much worse. Well, fast forward to midday the 27th, and I feel like I can barely breathe, and I'm lightheaded and gasping for breath walking around. A telehealth check-in with a doctor lasted about 1 minute, the doctor told me to go to the ER. So in I went, to Elmhurst hospital in Queens. When I was brought in, it was basically a room full of people intubated with oxygen and people coughing. I waited in a chair trying to	0
Covid positive, mild symptoms, what to expect	Hello, i hope this message reaches everyone with healthy vibes... I'm a 35 yo woman and i am covid positive, i had contact with a person from my job on Saturday july fourth, i had no symptoms at all but as soon as i heard she was sick, i got tested and i, along with four other co-workers were positive. My other co-workers had symptoms almost immediately. Two days after contact.. But i did not, besides a slight headache that would go away with tylenol.. As of now, the only symptom i have had are the headaches that i had for about two days last week, a slight dizziness and slight loss of taste and smell.. Oh! And my hips hurt in the morning when i wake up. My question is, it's been ten days, do you think i will develop worse symptoms? I'm driving myself crazy thinking that I'm just waiting to get super sick. Thank you in advance for any help.

My roommate had COVID	So my roommate has been in the hospital for the last two months due to coronavirus. Apparently he is coming back next week and I don't know how to feel about it. What kind of precautions should I take? I am thinking about finding a new place or sleeping in my car for the time being. Or is that too drastic?

One of my friends' half family has tested positive for the virus. I want to emotionally support her because I'm afraid that she'll harm herself.	"One of my best friends' family's 12 members have tested +ve for the virus (she, her brother and her parents are -ve atm). She's currently in a remote area with a poor internet connection. She's running out of school supplies. We've our mid-term exams starting in a few weeks after our ongoing weekly exams end. She explained this situation to our History teacher when our teacher asked our that why wasn't she submitting her pending assignments. The teacher scolded her in front of the whole class, said that ""You can't use Covid as an excuse to not submit the work. You just need a white sheet, 2 colour pencils and some creativity to do the Art assignment."" She stayed muted for the rest of the class and when I called her, she was crying and was freaked out. She said that the teacher is not understanding her situation and if anything happens to her family members, she'll not be able to bear it. She said that she's going into depression.

Positive for antibodies - symptoms reappeared day 60	I just tested positive for antibodies a week ago and over the past few days symptoms have come back. Headaches, dizzy, shortness of breathe, fatigue, and my heart races sometimes. It’s happens for a short part of the day maybe few hours but it happens everyday. I thought for 2 weeks I was in the clear. Physically and mentally exhausted. That aside, Happy Mother’s Day.

Didn’t know I had COVID	Hey guys, just wanted to share my story with you. Starting on Thursday July 2nd, I went to the gym and did a 2 mile run. During the run I noticed a tiny bit of burning in my nose while breathing - almost felt like what happens when water goes up your nose at the pool but not as bad. I typically have allergies so I thought nothing of it. That night my dad and stepmom came in from out of town and I met them for dinner. The next day I had a little bit of a stuffy nose and mild sinus pressure, I had mild pressure headaches. Over the rest of the weekend I felt the same, I was tired but nothing out of the usual. My girlfriend and I went to the beach for the day and celebrated the 4th together outside. Sunday was about the same with a little more fatigue but otherwise very mild symptoms. No cough, no fever, no sore throat... just sinus pressure and a no sense of smell. I have sinus infections pretty frequently so I scheduled a Teladoc appointment and got antibiotics called in because this felt exactly like a sinus	Didn’t know I had COVID Hey guys, just wanted to share my story with you.

Could I have been false negative?	Since last Friday I had a loss of appetite ,shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, coughing fits early on, impossible to breathe lying down in bed with my back flat, but I had no loss of taste or smell, no fever either. When I do any excercise I start getting pain in my chest again and feel very fatigued, talking too much can bring this on as well. I feel better today but any intense excercise can really knock me off my feet for the rest of the day. I got a test from the NHS (I'm Brit) from a drive in centre and got a negative result, is it possible that it was a false negative? I've never had shortness of breath like this before from any flu so I'm rather wary of my result.	Could I have been false negative?

Dysesthesia - stinging type sensations	Not sure if this is related or not! I've had tingling and numbness, but recently started having stinging or shock type sensations on my skin. Mostly feet and legs, but upper body as well and on my hands. There's no redness, no marks, no rash or anything of the sort. No reason to suspect bug bites. It feels like it could be nerves. I'm going to be making an appointment with my doctor soon to follow up on my lingering cough, so I'll bring it up with her. I'm just wondering if it's something any of you have experienced?

Whole family developed very light symptoms	So about last week my whole family developed stuffed sinuses &amp; sneezing. Some of us had it worse than others, some us also developed fatigue and headaches. It all lasted about 2 - 3 days for all of us and it’s all disappeared like magic The doctor said it was unusual to for all us develop potential cold symptoms so rapidly. So he suggested we all get tested just be safe. We hardly go out and are very careful. But could have that been it? My mom is 52 and dad is 66 and my dad is doing just fine now?

How do you manage? Suffering	I am lucky just to be good enough to type this. I was sick a month ago but was negative for Covid. A little over Two weeks ago I was recovered but had persistent fatigue that increased until it's debilitating. I suspect I have post viral symptoms. I am utterly sickly exhausted all day with a fatigue like no other. It wipes all your energy and you feel like you are just done. You feel so wiped and sickly but cannot reach true sleep. It is miserable as I lay in bed unable to do anything or even sleep but feel beyond fatigued. My blood work and CT scans are normal. Covid negative again. Urgent care doc says it was anxiety. Doc gave me a b12 shot that made me incredibly nauseous and said follow up in a week. I have been suffering these last two weeks which does not seem terrible. But it is. It does not come in waves and is constant, debilitating. Cant watch TV while incapacitated. Is this post covid symptoms? I went to doctors and an ENT who ruled out all standard causes like deficiency. Trying to ride it out but is truly a test	How do you manage? Suffering I am lucky just to be good enough to type this.

But did they tell you about the rash?	So I started having symptoms 7 days ago. I was exposed at work due to a company I work for encouraging unsafe PPE and decon practices (FF/EMT-B). I ended up working a shift with a person on the ambulance who didn't know they were positive yet. I then tested positive (just got my results). Everybody knows about the most common symptoms, such as fever, digestive issues, loss of taste and smell, etc. However, what no one is talking about is that 20% of cases also get a rash. And boy oh boy did I get a rash. It's on my knees, elbows, hands, feet, arms, legs.... Hot dang, did I get a hell of a rash. And oh my gosh it is itchy!!! I had to Google to even figure out that some people get a rash. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones that got EVERY SINGLE SYMPTOM. Anynody else out there cursed with this itch from hell? What did you use to make the itchies stop? My first go to is Benadryl, which will knock me into oblivion within 30 min of swallowing.	But did they tell you about the rash?

diarrhea at night, 12 hours or so since possible exposure?	I had Covid in April, was mild, recovered (symptoms tapered off). Today I was working on-location, first time in months. Had two mask on and didn't take them off. I was around a few people who returned from isolation. Now tonight I had pretty bad diarrhea, reminds me of my first stint with Covid, very liquidy. Also had pizza 3 hours ago or so. My concern is.. what are the chances this is covid? Could be be a more minor virus that I haven't been exposed to since April and caught my immune system off guard? Really don't want to go through this again.	diarrhea at night, 12 hours or so since possible exposure? I had Covid in April, was mild, recovered (symptoms tapered off).

What were your symptoms?	I have another question, are super swollen tonsils a symptom of covid-19? I'm scared. I have some moderate chest pain but no troubles breathing yet, it feels somewhat tight in my jugular notch and I've also got body aches. This could be tonsillitis but I'm uncertain what to make of it. I really hope I feel better sooner than later, I don't believe things have gotten worse so far, but I'll find out in the morning. I'm producing mucus that is mostly clear with green/yellow. I'm scared this is one of the more severe reactions to the illness. I may have come into contact with the virus when I went to a pulmonologist ironically enough, I went to the Lung Diagnostic Centre because I was concerned I may have developed chronic bronchitis as a result of smoking excessively for 8 years of my life. Anyways, I would like to hear your stories, what symptoms did you have and how long did they last? Did you feel worse before you got better, or was it bad from the start?

What kind of medicine did they gave me at the hospital?	So, I'm 29 M Italian and was hospitalized 19/03 after 8 days of high fever and fortunately no severe respiratory symptoms. However my fever was really high 40.5 °c at the hospital and one day the doctor said that he would try to cure me with medicines used in other countries against other viruses. After 2 days of IV medicines without any lebel on it (the doctor simply wrote my name on it with a pen) I got better and now I'm recovering at home. What do you think it was?

Possible exposure/symptoms?	Went to mcdonald’s 3 days ago (dumb of me) and the woman sounded sick over the loud speaker, as she was handing me my debit card back (not wearing gloves or a mask) she proceeded to cough on my card and give it back to me.

I don’t think I’ve had any other interaction with anyone ILL.	0
Day two of feeling a whole lot better. Still really anxious that this could go south.	Soooo....I went and got tested yesterday because I had loss of taste and smell. I've had symptoms since last Friday though, so this is technically day 7. It was rough for the first 4 days, followed by a day of feeling better, followed by another bad day. Today I feel pretty much normal minus this lingering sternum pressure. Almost feels like it needs to pop or something. I've been keeping up on my vitamins. I feel like maybe I got really lucky and this was an extremely mild case, but I have this lingering anxiety that it could go south. I read and hear way to often about people feeling better and then in a week they relapse and end up hospitalized. I get my test results in about 3-5 days, so I'm biting at my nails until I see them. My husband keeps telling me not to get in my head, and to stop thinking the worst, and I feel like for the most part I've done really good. But I just can't help that lingering anxiety...

For anyone who had covid-19 themselves, had family or friends that got it, and/or knows someone that died from it, how do you handle all the constant news, social media posts, anti-maskers, etc. now?	"My grandpa, granny, myself, and my brother all battled covid-19 in July. My grandpa was hit the worst and passed away on Monday. We have taken this virus and pandemic seriously since everything happened. I had been appalled and tired of the stupidity, but now that I've watched an immediate family member deteriorate and die from it, I'm furious and have no patience for it. I'm tired of ""laugh"" reacts on covid-19 posts. I'm tired of people minimizing a covid-19 related death if the person was eldery or had underlying issues. I'm tired of public health being politicized. I'm tired of anti-maskers who have no regard for anyone else. I'm tired of the asinine people who STILL think this is all fake and much more. I had been tired of all of this, but my grandpa's death has exacerbated my feelings. Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope when you've been personally impacted? Do you have arguments with people or share your experience? I had to deactivate my social media because I just want a break from it all."

Tested Negative via Nasal Swab, Still Feel Like Crud?	Considering Digestive Symptoms and Cold Symptoms, this would be week 3, maybe 3 1/2.

Relapse after donating plasma?	I’m wondering if anyone else had a relapse in symptoms after donating plasma. Everyone around me is convinced my multiple plasma donations “took all my antibodies” and that it caused me to relapse, but I can’t find anything to support this idea online. I’m just curious if anyone else had suspicious timing with plasma donation and symptoms returning? Background info: I am a 29 year old female who tested positive March 13, mild to moderate case (history of asthma so lung symptoms were rough). My symptoms went from March 2-March 20. After March 20, I fully recovered and was completely healthy for a month and a half. My only remaining “symptom” was a lack of smell and taste. I was not able to get a second test to find out if I was ever truly negative. I have also not had an anti-body test. I’ve been social distancing/WFH since March. I started donating plasma in the beginning of May. Around the same time I also tried to exercise for the first time and had chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing for 2 days.

DAE tested negative first?	I'm a healthcare worker who was working on quarantined floors last week but do not know if I was directly exposed to someone with COVID, the precaution was taken as another employee tested positive and visited these floors. This Monday I woke up feeling like hell. Low grade fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, nausea, horrible headache and potentially loss of smell (my husband told me I wrecked the bathroom and I couldn't smell a thing). I got tested Tuesday (day 2 of symptoms) and just got my results today (Thursday) that it was negative. My fever has since resolved but I've had diarrhea and nausea the whole week, stomach pain that kept me up last night and still fatigued with on and off headache. I'm really surprised my result was negative. I'm worried about leaving my guest room and infecting my husband and also I worry about going back to work where I work with older adults who are higher risk. I ordered a pixel test online before my appt with urgent care and so I sent in the specimen for that today and won't hear back for 2-3 days.

Shortness of breath?	I'm on day 18 and most symptoms have all resolved. I had to go to the dr on Friday to get cleared for work. He wouldn't clear me because I still have shortness of breath and some fatigue. Those that had shortness of breath: when did it clear? I'm out of PTO and have been advised to apply for short term disability. I'm just wondering if I should play down the shortness of breath if it's something that just lingers or wait it out if it'll be short lived.	Shortness of breath?

Anxiety	I have a question that may be a dumb question: I saw many of my friends ordering from Ubereats, DoorDash, etc., so I decided to do get take out. I asked a lot of questions and they told me to do contactless delivery, which was what I did, and I washed my hands before/after eating. Afterwards, I was reading articles online about doing take out and they mentioned it was better to take the food out of the container/packaging before eating it. I did not do that and now I’m freaking out. What are the chances of anything bad happening to me? I have been diagnosed with OCD, so covid-19 has brought on a lot of paranoia/anxiety for me.

Altered sense of smell? (not loss of smell)	I'm (24F) an essential worker near Huntington Beach (yeah, *that* Huntington Beach...) and dozens of people come into the store without masks and flip out if we ask them to put one on. I have been concerned the past couple days and I was able to snag an appointment to be tested tomorrow. On Sunday I woke up with a pretty bad sore throat and I chalked it up to allergies since mine are pretty severe and I had been dusting the house the night before. Sore throat went away by Tuesday morning. Tuesday night, I made jasmine rice and it smelled like funky cheese to me. My family thought it smelled fine. It was so repulsive that I practically forced myself to eat it. I didn't have much of an appetite yesterday (Wednesday) and food didn't taste good. The trash in the kitchen overwhelmingly smelled like spoiled milk even though we don't buy dairy products in our household. Today, I ordered a greek salad for delivery and the cucumbers smell like fish!

Heat and stress causing flare ups after recovery?	I was really hoping I would be one of those cases that recovered and got on with my life, but it isn't looking that way. I dealt with some stressful nonsense my one day back at work. That weekend I started coughing and wheezing. This is three weeks after the last of the awful symptoms resolved and a week after my lingering nasal congestion cleared. It was weird, because I barely coughed when I was really sick. I took off work and saw my doctor who sent me for another test. The wheezing cleared up and I felt fine the first week. The second week I was doing some gardening in the heat and began feeling horrible. Tired, achey, headache, shortness of breath, and like my heart was trying to jump out of my chest. I relaxed in the AC and started feeling better. I got my negative test and caught another end of the week workday. I felt fine that day and the next. I went to the park on another hot day.

For how long have your symptoms lasted?	Can't be tested except if I get admitted to the hospital which I hope won't happen. But my workplace has reported positive cases before closing. I started to get a fever on March 15: 99.5. From March 15 to 18 the fever was around 100/101 with a spike at 103.4 and burning lungs like when you run in the cold. That's when I called the nurse line and they told there is nothing they can do. March 18 to 21 fever back between 99.3 to 100.2, still burning throat and lungs but okish. March 22, spent the whole day in bed, so weak. March 23, better, fever around 99.3/100.7 Today: so so weak, back in bed again, fever still averaging in the 99/100 but short of breath fir everything and even if hungry it's too much energy to chew.

Did anyone start with just a cough?	Woke up this morning feeling tight in my upper chest, usually i can cough up any post nasal drip but this cough sounds a bit more “barky”. Sounds a lot like when id get sick as kid, as i had seasonal winter asthma that i eventually grew out of. Only thing is i dont have any other symptoms, no fever, no chills, no headache no nausea, taste and smell are as potent as ever. Checked my heart rate and spo2 and everything is normal. My energy levels are normal, i feel totally healthy in everyway except this tightness and cough. I can even take nice and deep “lung” breathes. My concern in that i traveled recently to a state that is seeing a bigger spike in cases, i wasnt in the areas that are really being affected but its still a concern. So did anyone start with just a somewhat mild, dry, wheezing cough or does this sound like intense allergies?	Did anyone start with just a cough? Woke up this morning feeling tight in my upper chest, usually i can cough up any post nasal drip but this cough sounds a bit more “barky”. Sounds a lot like when id get sick as kid, as i had seasonal winter asthma that i eventually grew out of. Only thing is i dont have any other symptoms, no fever, no chills, no headache no nausea, taste and smell are as potent as ever. Checked my heart rate and spo2 and everything is normal. My energy levels are normal, i feel totally healthy in everyway except this tightness and cough. I can even take nice and deep “lung” breathes.

Tested negative on PCR-TEST but X-Rays showed possible pneumonia	My symptoms started with fever (99.5-101.00), diarrhea, mild and muscle aches the first 3-4days. Day5,6,7 no symptoms. Day8-11 had GI Issues and mild discomfort on chest. Day12-15 only mild discomfort on chest. Day 16 I had only one water stool bowel movement and my discomfort on chest kinda increased in pain. Day 18 went to gastroenterologist and he assumes is covid. We did general blood, urine and stool test to ruled out any other viruses, bacteria or parasites, and everything seems fine with my lab tests. My X-ray looks generally fine but an irregular density on right Lung possible Pneumonia. CT Scan was done today to confirm so waiting for results... My covid test NASAL swab PCR test came out negative, so Im doing antibodies IGM to IGG next week to confirm. Any of you guys had these similarities?

Weird chest pressure/dull ache for about 6 months now	I have had this weird chest pressure on my lower ribs and upper abdomen since late March. Sometimes it goes up to the center of my chest too. I have observed that sitting makes the pain worse and while lying on my back eases some of the pain but still feel like I have a tight chest/unable to expand to a 100% and I am unable to lay on my back for longer periods of time. Sometimes I also have a cold feeling inside my chest and drinking hot water feels soothing. Initially I thought I had contracted Covid. But I had no other symptoms like fever or cough or even loss of smell/taste. But during the first few weeks I might had some chills and a bit of fatigue. I was also living with 2 other roommates at that time and they did not have any symptoms at all. I couldn't get tested at that time since in my country (India), they were only testing people who had come in contact with a confirmed case I had read articles saying that people have recovered within a month or two so I thought home quarantining was the best option since	Weird chest pressure/dull ache for about 6 months now I have had this weird chest pressure on my lower ribs and upper abdomen since late March.

Thought I just had strep throat	If you feel like you’re sick, dont just get tested for other illnesses. I am 23 quite healthy, tested for covid and strep because of a sore throat. I also had some slight flu like symptoms and sneezing here and there. Strep came out positive, thought that was all it was, but days later I find out I am positive for covid. I’m curious as to whether covid weakened my immune system enough for me to also catch strep? Or if strep is somehow a side effect? I’m not sure. Started feeling a lot better a few days after strep test, but throat is still a bit sore. Overall sense of sickness has gone away for the most part. Had some loss of appetite.

The 10 days until you’re not contagious is a lie	Hey everyone, I’ve been posting a lot here (sorry but it’s my way of coping) but I had to move out my apartment and move back with my parents. I started having symptoms 8/29 and tested positive 8/31. So I stayed in a hotel till 9/8 and moved my stuff into my parents and my mom started having symptoms 9/12 and tested positive this morning. I’m terrified that she’s gonna die, she’s feeling a lot better today but both my parents are high risk and if they die I’m probably just gonna kill myself out of guilt. I paid a bunch of money to stay in a hotel to finish iso I wore a mask around my house and she still got sick 😞	The 10 days until you’re not contagious is a lie Hey everyone, I’ve been posting a lot here (sorry but it’s my way of coping) but I had to move out my apartment and move back with my parents.

After a week, feeling better but mom isn’t	My (18F) symptoms have improved drastically and I did get a positive test result back, but luckily I’ve only gotten better. I’m worried about my mom (38F) because she was told that she’s at higher risk due to her age and her weight. She seemed to get better but she’s now again feeling nauseous, very weak, having trouble breathing, overall seeming worse than before. Kaiser sent her some medication but it literally only made her worse so she stopped taking it but I’m at loss for what to do next. Pls can anyone let me know your remedies or put my mind at ease.

Type 2 Diabetic: Tested Positive	Never thought I’d have to post here because I have taken every precaution, but I live with my mother and partner and they have had to continue to work through this, so it’s possible I picked it up that way. I am 29 years old, very obese, and have a lot of health problems. I’m a type 2 diabetic (decently well controlled with just Metformin, no insulin), I have hypertension, hypothyroidism, as well as mild asthma, sleep apnea, and mental health issues. I tested positive on the 29th on the rapid test, and another was sent off to confirm. I just wanted to recap my symptoms and how covid as been in regards to my pre-existing heath issues. 08/28/2020: Started with diarrhea and sinus drainage. I also had a little bit of ear pain. No fever at this point, and I assumed I had a sinus infection. 08/29/2020: I went to the ER at this point because I was beginning to feel worse. I still thought I had a bad sinus infection, but wanted to get checked out because I just recovered from a bad case of pneumonia earlier this month (both COVID test came back negative at that point).

Sore Throat &amp; Testing Questions	I have two jobs as an essential worker. I work in a warehouse full-time and I teach in a childcare center part-time. I always wear a mask and do my best to stay six feet away from others, but my students aren't required to wear masks and my teacher colleagues haven't been wearing masks either. When I go to the center, I can't socially distance well because I have to change diapers, help kids wash hands, wipe their faces after lunch, etc. Other than work, I have stayed home for the most part, except for grocery shopping, walks around my neighborhood, and one trip to the mountains (but I didn't come within 6 ft. of anyone on that trip). I started to have a slightly sore throat on Monday night. On Tuesday, I started having occasional sneezing and a slightly congested/runny nose. This morning my sore throat feels a bit worse and my temperature seems higher than usual; so far my thermometer says I'm 98.5 when I usually am 97.1, although my thermometer is old and I don't know if I can trust it. I'm trying to find an urgent care for a rapid test today, but I'm confused about	Sore Throat &amp; Testing Questions I have two jobs as an essential worker.

Tested positive for IgM antibodies today after 2 negative nasal swab tests	Wow, I finally have some tentative proof that what I have been going through for the past 3 months was not all in my head! But I still have so many questions... If you test positive for IgM and not IgG does that mean you are still experiencing an active infection? Would you still be contagious? Has anyone tested positive for only IgM after months of being of being sick? I thought I’d share my story since reading everyone’s experiences has helped me so much, especially since, at least in my case, my doctor has been less than helpful and my family have been skeptical that I could be sick this long from covid. Here is a timeline of my symptoms, sorry it’s a long read: 27F, 5ft 105 pounds, A blood type, and no known health issues besides a history of anemia. Baseline temp of 97.9. End of Feb - Major brain fog, migraine like headaches, fatigue, and one brutal night of headache induced vomiting. I could barely make it through a day of work, and almost got into a couple car accidents while driving during this time. It was weird, I was even having trouble keeping up conversations	Tested positive for IgM antibodies today after 2 negative nasal swab tests Wow, I finally have some tentative proof that what I have been going through for the past 3 months was not all in my head!

Do you feel the same after recovering?	Two months ago I had many of the symptoms including shortness of breath, aches, nausea, loss off appetite, disorientation and diarreah. I had to go on FMLA at work. I'm a non smoker 33 years old no history of asthma. I've never been that sick and it lasted one month. I tested negative but don't trust the results and I still can't breathe properly some days. Tightness in chest many days for no reason. I have an inhaler but that does little. Is this just my life now? Does covid19 create long term respiratory problems? I didn't have pneumonia during my illness but I could never breathe right while I was ill. I've seen a few doctors but they don't know anything and it's not anxiety. Is anyone dealing with changes long term? It's scary and hard to live normally feeling this way.

Those who have recovered, did you develop digestion issues that you never had prior to being sick?	Around day 12 I was feeling fine minus the few occurrences of feeling tired because I was bed ridden for almost 2 weeks. I had about 5 days of feeling normal and I was still quarantine so my brother was giving me my meals. I ate healthy for the most part minus the ego waffles he would give me for breakfast. I should mention that I had a bad case of diarrhea for like 8 days and was working on getting my poop to form normally again. My doctor said that it might feel uncomfortable and it will take some time. Eventually it did go back to normal but then I developed stomach pain at the top of my stomach and lower abdomen area. At first it would come and go. And I even went to the emergency room after I got out of quarantine. They gave me meds and told me to take anti acids for a few days. What the hospital gave me worked after a couple of hours and I felt like myself again. But 2 days later the pain came back. Probably cuz I wasn’t able to take the strong anti acids that they gave me.

Metallic taste is getting too strong	Hi guys. I posted here the other day about a strong metal taste. Today it has been especially bad. The taste is always prevalent, but worse when eating or drinking. Food quite literally tastes like pennies. I dread eating. It's highly highly distracting .... I cant focus on anything else. Has anyone experienced such a symptom to this degree?	Metallic taste is getting too strong Hi guys. I posted here the other day about a strong metal taste. Today it has been especially bad.

To long duration symptomers: Has anyone got the antibody cocktail they are giving to the kawasaki symptom kids?	I am wondering if anyone who has had long duration symptoms, at any point did any medical professional give you the antibody cocktail that they have used on youths showing kawasaki disease like symptoms? If so, were there any improvements? Just wondering as I am going on 4+ months of cold like symptoms (had a stomach illness with weird breathing feelings just before lockdown), congestion, persistent cough, and sore throat that feels like yelling not like a viral cold and wonder if this is the same thing manifesting itself to a lesser degree in adults vs the kawasaki disease like symptoms in children. I have seen about 15 different doctors with blood work, xrays, and ct scans non-stop and still no answers. Odd thing is I tested negative twice and also negative on antibodies. I have two theories on this which is either this thing creates a perpetual inflammatory response even after it is beaten or it is actually hitting the immune system and maybe the persistent symptoms that we see is the things we are normally immune attacking creating inflammation.

Shortness of Breath but O2 Normal	On day 21. Thought I was recovering but Temp and SOB came back even worse. Wondering if others have had this experience where they have SOB for a day or two but O2 stays above 95 the entire time.

Headaches and dizzy	A few weeks ago I lost my taste and smell, had dizziness, headache and fatigue. I then since have most of my taste and smell back.

Aches only symptom?	Hi all got swabbed today after having weird leg pains for 7ish days. Granted I have been running, so it's possible it's muscle strain or something, but it's a weird sensation. Hurts at rest and just feels achey. Comes and goes - not consistent and in both legs. D-dimer was fine. I had ORIF surgery last September for a break in my foot, and the leg that was impacted had these same types of aches for a brief period. No other symptoms. My doctor suggested some blood tests to test potassium, vitamin and mineral levels. He thinks I may have some imbalances, but had me swabbed anyway at our local drive thru center. Has anyone had aches as their only symptom? No fever, no chest pain, no sore throat, no cough, no headache. Minor sleepiness in afternoon but that's just me and my insomnia I've had for years. I've been home most the time, usually get groceries delivered, and never go running in areas where others are and have a mask.	Aches only symptom?

Oddly enough, I think COVID enhanced my sense of taste and smell?	I was someone who pretty much always had a sinus infection or some kind of congestion before COVID. When my symptoms began, I lost nearly all sense of taste and smell and, now that I’m on the mend, it has come back and I can taste and smell way better than I could even before I had COVID :D food is a whole new kind of pleasure now! And my boyfriends breath is suddenly awful now in the mornings since I can smell it 😂 pros and cons, I guess. Hang in there everyone, you got this!

What was your early symptom experience?	I'm a 21 year old female, overweight at 5'4 and 180 pounds. I've had symptoms on and off since March but my test results never came back (I'm assuming they weren't refrigerated, samples lost) but now I'm sick again! This time I'm having a sore throat and dry cough and my asthma seems to be acting up, my airways feel restricted in a way, and I'm so tired. Does this sound like COVID-19?

The government should be sending out mandatory follow up tests to those who tested positive	Anyone else disagree with the guidance from our Government regarding self isolating for 10 days from the start of symptoms?

Anyone else going through this too?	I recently went through a month-long battle with Covid19 and I have to say the experience sucked. Being hospitalized and on a ventilator is no joke. I hope I never have to go through that again. The reason for my post is to see if anyone else has been going through what I call “Covid after effects”. I’ve developed these symptoms after I got better and finding info online has been kind of hit or miss. So, they’re as follows: 1. Rough, dry cough that won’t go away and kind of begins with a tingling sensation in the throat. 2. Nerve pain behind the eyes and in the head every time you cough. 3. Lack of continuos concentration in tasks at hand. 4. Tiredness that won’t go away. 5. Intermittent insomnia. 6. Getting out of breath from regular tasks. 7. Weird sensation that the air has a peculiar smell everywhere you go. Thanks for any advice, experience or guidance you can offer. Take care and stay safe!	Anyone else going through this too? I recently went through a month-long battle with Covid19 and I have to say the experience sucked. Being hospitalized and on a ventilator is no joke. I hope I never have to go through that again.

How safe is pet sitting for a Covid positive best friend?	My wife’s best friend, practically sister, was admitted to the hospital yesterday with Covid-19. We’ve been talking with her immediate family and realized her dog and cats haven’t been fed or let out of the house in over 24 hours. Of course I want to help by taking the dog to stay with us but I have my own family to worry about. The dog would be able to stay outside with our 2 dogs. Thank you in advance for any help!

I hate this virus and I want this to be over	Im going on 7 months about since i first got it and I am sick of people downplaying this thing. Am I making up these feelings? NO I don't understand how people can think that I am making up body pain that occurs when i jog or anything higher than a walk. I am 19 and a male and It's just crazy how badly i have been hit. Some kind of bacterial infection made this 3 times worse in april and I regret not getting help earlier with that. I have taken 5 or 6 rounds of antibiotics since the beginning of this year and I am sick of pills. Doctors don't know whats wrong so they just give you those to hopefully get rid of the pain. Steroids made me worse and made my OCD anxiety jump through the roof. I just want this to be over. I want to be with people without worrying about a relapse. I want to run, I want to play frisbee, I desperately miss bowling. I am weak and my entire body was in pain after I started to try to bowl again which has never happened after a break before. I can't	I hate this virus and I want this to be over Im going on 7 months about since i first got it and I am sick of people downplaying this thing. Am I making up these feelings?

Lost most ability to taste, some loss of smell, mouth tastes like metal, feel woozy.	Hello, as the title states, I’ve maybe 70 % of my ability to taste anything, smell as well. I can taste sharp flavors, like only the sharp end of sour dough bread, but nothing in between. I can also taste bitter, like only the bitter part of chocolate or coffee (even with cream and sugar) Onset was May 17th after a normal active day, then it all changed by evening. Everything tastes like dull, sharp, or like metal. I’m not particularly a fan of eating tin cans, so it’s pretty gross! I’m also feeling just really out of it, weak, woozy.. out of body. I’ve read this can be a primary symptom but I’m struggling with finding posts where this was someone’s primary symptom. I do not feel right at all. I’d appreciate anything that could help. My husband has also been coughing a bit.	Lost most ability to taste, some loss of smell, mouth tastes like metal, feel woozy.

Do any of you have a strong and quick localized head pain once in a while after recovery?	I have had some covid symptoms a few weeks ago, with lingering low fever (37,2°C), headaches, pain on my face in general, GI symptoms and possibly some light shortness of breath. I can’t be sure it was covid, but I believe I’m recovered of whatever that was. I’m gonna copy some things I wrote about it. Day 14/05: for ~3 days I’ve been feeling a strong localized pain on the top left of my head. It lasts a few seconds. (It’s been ~6 days that my temperature went back to normal). Day 17/05: I’ve been feeling this “twinge” on the past few days. Once or twice a day. Today is 30/06 and I’ve felt it again. It has been happening every few days. It’s strong, sudden but very quick. Always on the top left of my head. It once happened when I moved too suddenly, but most of the time I’m staying still. While I write this, I feel a super faint and lingering pain on that area. So, can anyone relate? I’m very curious and a bit concerned. Under normal conditions I would go to a doctor, but in my city I believe it’s too risky right now :/	Do any of you have a strong and quick localized head pain once in a while after recovery?

How long did it take for your symptoms to worsen?	Started having symptoms three days ago, had a fever, headache and a slight sore throat. The only consistent symptom has been the headache. Managed to get tested today, should get the results within 48 hours. I'm wondering if these symptoms will worsen or not, how many of you had symptoms that got progressively worse and how long did they take?	How long did it take for your symptoms to worsen?

Very mild atypical symptoms - extensive covid-19 exposure - doubting myself?	Hi, I'm kind of driving myself mad trying to work out if I have Covid-19 or not... Hoping that maybe someone will read this and have experienced something that can help me figure it out or maybe this will help someone having similar symptoms to me? So I am 25/F, no underlying health conditions, pretty healthy/don't get sick much/BMI 21I live in London and work in central London, I was commuting using multiple public transport routes, bus and tube included, 50 minute commutes twice a day up until 20th March. Therefore my exposure to the London community was extensive and given current data there was high numbers of community transmission in London by 20th March. On top of that, I work in an office of 25 people and 4 of them had confirmed covid-19 diagnosis by the 20th, one is actually unfortunately fighting for their life right now in ICU. So on the 20th March, all I can really say is that I felt weird. I put it down to anxiety and general covid-panic. Over the next couple of days I started feeling a very specific feeling in my throat, between my voice box and my lungs.

Do my symptoms sound like Covid 19 or severe allergies?	So back on 4th of July I felt like shit, no other description, I had a mild fever, my lungs felt heavy and hot my sinuses were stuffed completely but no runny nose, and my anxiety was through the roof. This continues on for the last 2 weeks. The fever was only for 1 single day. But a week after that I got home and was shaking, sweating, and shitting. I didnt leave the bathroom for over an hour. Last week my lungs still felt heavy and hot, I hadn't had a cough or anything and I could still take deep full breathes when I wanted to. But while talking i felt like I'd run out if breath a little quicker than usual. I felt exhausted all week long and was sleeping 10-11 hours a night and still was tired during the day. By Friday this had eased up. Fast forward to today and I woke up feeling better, 8 hours sleep and I woke up feeling pretty fresh and recharged. I still feel like my lungs are a little heavy and hot, and I still feel like I run out of breath fairly quickly. I was just thinking maybe	Do my symptoms sound like Covid 19 or severe allergies?

I am waiting for my test results. Did you experience breathlessness/SoB several days before you developed other symptoms (sore throat, headache, body aches, etc...?)	35 F, Normal BMI, No pre-existing conditions, work out regularly, and eat well 90% of the time. My husband is 34 and is in kidney failure (not yet on dialysis) and we have 3 children here. A 17-year old daughter, a 6-year old daughter, and a 2 1/2-year-old son. I am the only one who does the shopping and we have all stayed at home otherwise. Last Thursday, I noticed I was very sore for no reason like I'd worked out for 4-hours the day before. I went for a neighborhood stroll with my two little ones, and I noticed that I was so extremely winded and out of breath, I had to sit down. My daughter asked if I was ok, and I ended up getting up and we went home. It went away. Friday morning, I woke up around 5 AM with pretty bad stomach cramps. I had diarrhea several times and then was fine. Later on Friday night, my husband and I were laughing at Tiger King on Netflix and I started to tell him some stuff I'd seen online, and I couldn't get more than a few words in without having to stop for a breath.

Could this be Covid?	can I ask early May I had a sudden shortness of breath and fatigue and generally not feeling well but I always check my temperature and I don't have fever. I also do not have cough but after 12 days unexpectedly I felt I have a panic attack or an heart attack my bp goes 150/104 and my heart rate is 130 not really sure if that is an heart attack or just panic attack. My symptoms continue on and off like a roller coaster. last week of March I feel much better but not really well. on June 16 for the first time I felt improvements on my breathing but a feeling of something on my throat still lingers when I breath deeply. It will go on and off all my symptoms until this very day. I feel so depressed already because I have never been sick for this long all my life. Could this really be covid?

I think I messed up	Sorry for the rant in, advance. I posted here a few days ago, but deleted it. Long story short, I had some very mild symptoms- congestion (varying degrees), sneezing, itchy mouth, throat, lips and eyes (especially after sneezing), very mild muscle pain, and my sense of smell was a bit strange (after starting to check it like 20 times a day i notixed that it's a bit more intense at certain times than others. It's never weak, i can always smell stuff decently, if i wasn't checking it I probably wouldn't notice anything so i thought that I was just paranoid), as well as a mild sore throat that lasted like two days. Since I've had GERD symptoms for years, I attributed the latter to that. Since all this is pretty mild and sounds much more like allergies, I didn't really think this was covid until i started feeling slight pain in my thighs and arms. After that I decided to just stay at home for 10 days to see if I develop other symptoms. I didn't. The problem i that I've been having intense anxiety about this whole thing for 2 months.

Positive to Negative and it feels so good!	Wanted to share my experience with my mild case of COVID for all other mild-ers out there going through the same thing. Note: I never had a fever or cough. I drank Gatorade, Pedialyte, and obviously a ton of water everyday. Took Vitamin C and fish oil pills every day as well. Laid around the house a LOT and watched 7 seasons of Survivor :) Let me know if you have any questions! -Exposure Saturday, 8/15 (counting this as day 1) -Tests on day 2 (Sunday) and day 3 (Monday) both come back negative- I think I’m in the clear. -No symptoms for 8 days -Monday (day 9)- exhaustion, limited taste and smell at night, no fever. -Tuesday (day 10)- no fever, a ton of sneezing, congestion, exhaustion. Limited taste and smell. Some diarrhea. Took test. -Wednesday (day 11)-diarrhea, NO taste/smell whatsoever, sounds like congestion in my voice but not congested (nostrils felt clear) somewhat winded when taking the dog for a walk.

Unusual upset stomach and GI problems	Might be a silly thing to ask but it’s been almost three days now and I still have NO appetite. I first wrote it off as ate something bad, though now I barely want to eat and if I do I want to throw it up. Not only that but I haven’t had the best bowel movements either since my lost of appetite. I wasn’t really sure if this could be an initial symptom but it doesn’t hurt to ask. Read online and it’s all mainly upper respiratory symptoms first. I believe my doctor can now do antibody testing but would that show up now? Or should I wait until my GI issues go away.

swollen lymph nodes months later?	I was presumed positive by my doctor in March and since then, on and off again, have had swollen lymph nodes in my neck. There doesn't seem to be a pattern in when it happens but has been pretty consistent at least once every two weeks. Through spring and early summer my doctor attributed it to post viral syndrome but recently said it was likely just caused by allergies. I have never experienced this with allergies, so my question is.... has anyone else experienced this months after otherwise recovering?	swollen lymph nodes months later?

Donating plasma/low hemoglobin. How do I get my iron up by the next appt?	I went to New York Blood Center on the 17th to donate convalescent plasma. I was unable to do so because my hemoglobin was low. I'm a woman, so its supposed to be 12.5 in order to donate. It was 11, and then when they repeated the test 10.5, so they sent me home. I was really bummed. Im in NYC and have seen so many people die that I'm really desperate to help. However, I have been a vegetarian for 35 years so being anemic isn't new to me. It's never affected my life or anything I wanted to do until now. I have another appointment on the 27th and need to get my iron up fast. Ive been taking an iron pill very day, eating a lot of spinach and dried apricots. Using my cast iron pan more than usual (supposedly that helps). Any other ideas?	Donating plasma/low hemoglobin.

I feel like someone is squeezing my brain	I have the worst headache of my life currently. I’ve been getting it everyday for the last 4 days but today it’s way worse. Does anyone else have this symptom? It hurts so so bad. Like a really strong dude is squeezing the sides of my head with all of his might. It’s mostly around my forehead, some behind my eyes. Tested negative like a week into symptoms but suggested by two doctors that it may have been a false negative. Other symptoms include constant fever for the last 2 weeks, stomach pain, pots symptoms, dizziness, night sweats, chills, etc.	I feel like someone is squeezing my brain I have the worst headache of my life currently.

I have had a skin condition called Tinea for about 30 years. Nothing has cured it. But now it is just about gone and getting better daily. I did notice a period when I went outside and the sun was out that my exposed skin would tingle and itch like crazy for about 15 minutes and then calm down and act normal.

Suspected Covid-19 playing tricks on me	Anyone else have reoccurring symptoms? Like they disappear for a few days and then pop back up? Been out of work (essential employee) since 3/21 and I think I have been sick since 3/15. Called my doctor on the 16th, said probably allergies. Take your medicine. It didn't feel like allergies to me but I just started dealing with them last year, so maybe I'm unfamiliar with how they feel. My symptoms were very mild- stuffy nose, post nasal drip, itchy throat and I was very tired. I called out of work on 3/17, didn't get any worse - went back on 3/18. While at work on 3/20, I realized I couldn't walk without stopping to catch my breath. This was weird as my job consists primarily of walking. Called advice nurse while at work and scheduled a phone visit with urgent care. Finished my day (45 mins left) and went home. Talked to the doctor, said probably upper respiratory infection, take albuterol. Stay home 3 days. Still unsure of what was going on and kinda freaked out, I called the advice nurse again on 3/21.

Is this similar to longtermers' experiences?	I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with my body. I got sick about 7 weeks ago. Tested negative but was told to presume positive. My worst symptoms were the cough and shortness of breath. Also had a bunch of other symptoms that were similar to covid. I was sick for about 2 weeks, then I seemed to be getting better. All but the cough and some mild shortness of breath and fatigue remained. I thought I was gradually getting better each week, though still needed to use an inhaler at least every other day. Then out of nowhere last Monday I woke up feeling worse than ever. Violent, paroxysmal coughing, burning chest, wheezing, gasping for air. Feels like my lungs are being squeezed. Two different doctors said it actually sounded like whooping cough, but I tested negative for that. Had to get a breathing treatment at the hospital for the first time in my life. I'm now dependent on a nebulizer 3-4x a day just to function, and I'm still coughing and wheezing. My doctor doesn't seem to understand what's going on, and they're saying this doesn't fit the known pattern of covid. I am trying to	Is this similar to longtermers' experiences?

Should I get tested	Other the past 2 months I have had some weird symptoms and they seemingly got stronger as of the last two weeks. 2 months ago, the spread presumably wasn’t really high up where I live so I suspected allergies. Although I don’t really remember allergies being so noticeable before. Constant Symptoms I remember for the past 2 months: - yellow green stuff in nose that I occasionally have to get out during the day. - occasional slightly sore throat, one day not sore, the other day sore. Symptoms I’m noticing around this time - same symptoms listed above - some muscle soreness from minor and very short exercise - very small amount of tightness in chest (I can’t tell really if it’s anxiety though), sometimes the worsens a small amount and goes away - occasional minor headaches - eyes slightly itchy - more of a constant sore throat The other person I live with doesn’t seem to be sick, just allergies. Should I get tested by a doctor now or should I wait and see if anything gets worse.

Positive or not??? Confused!!	I first had mild symptoms 7 days ago, including loss of taste and smell, fatigue, mild congestion and cough. Really felt just like a cold. I got tested this past Saturday with a rapid test (antigen) and it came back positive. I decided to confirm with a PCR lab test that I got two days later (9/1) and the result came back tonight.... NEGATIVE? Is there such a thing as a false positive? I did have symptoms but they were very short and very mild. Just seems weird that tests two days apart within 7 days of symptoms onset would yield different results? So confusing.	Positive or not??? Confused!!

I have drank caffeine and alcohol, which many people say is a cause for relapse, and have been okay. I’m still a little scared to try working out but I’m gonna give it a shot this week. The only noticeable thing I have a problem with is feeling tired throughout the day. I really hope this is the last of it. To the long haulers here, I really hope you guys start to get better. I’ve been reading this sub for awhile and the thing that comforted me is that so many people are having these long term issues that doctors won’t be able to ignore it and hopefully we all get some answers soon. If I do happen to relapse, you bet your ass I’ll be back. Good luck and best wishes for everyone!!	I think I actually beat this thing! Day 22, M19, I have practically no symptoms!

Long termers - will it be like this forever?	Hi, I’ve been reading posts on here for a while now and they have been a great comfort to me. I thought it would be a good idea to reach out in the hope that those who have recovered can shed some light/ those who are in the same boat as me don’t feel alone. Please excuse me if I’m rambling, I’ve not written a post on here before. For context, I’m young (27 f) and before symptoms set in I exercised (boxing, weights and cardio) 5-7 times a week. I started feeling unwell on the evening of March 10th 2020. I worked from home on March 11 and 12. I felt a little better on the 12th so I returned to the office on March 13 thinking I had just been experiencing a cold. I started to feel awful in the office (SOB, dizzy, general malaise) - I was sent home from work and called NHS 111 (I’m from the UK) I was told to self isolate for 7 days. A few days later, I was convinced I was better and that the slight cough I was developing was just a “hangover” from the previous few days’ symptoms. On	Long termers - will it be like this forever?

Steps to take post recovery	To those who have tested positive and have since recovered in your homes: what steps did you guys take to clean your home and whatnot? Fiancé and I are positive (he tested positive, I’m presumed positive due to contact and I have lost my sense of smell) and I was wondering what steps you took to cleanse your home after you recovered? I already plan on changing out toothbrush heads, disinfecting bathrooms, washing everything we wore, cleaning all the dishes, but is there anything else?

Does covid symptoms get worse?	I started having a headache, fatigue and a stuffy nose after I woke up from a nap a few hours ago. I’m unsure if it is covid 19 but I think it would be better for me to not get tested since I live in nyc and I live in the area most effected in nyc, so if I do go and turns out to not be covid there is a big chance I might get it at the hospital. My step dad was getting body chills a few days ago but he’s better now. I’m self quarantine in my room to avoid anyone else getting sick. I guess I’m just really scared this might get really bad and I won’t know what signs to look out for. Anyone who’s had it, what was the first symptoms you had and did it get worse or better?

Was there a lot of Dr's who were telling patients with Covid19 in the early months like January that it was just anxiety?	Back In January I felt weird like Shaking and had the chills real bad with the shortness of breath. I went to the ER multiple times and finally a Dr. But they all said it was Gerd or anxiety. My hands and feet would be sweaty all the time and cold as well as cold sweats. I have seen a lot of posts where the Dr has told them that it was just anxiety but then tested positive after multiple visits.

My fiance didn't believe me that I lost 100% ability to smell or taste anything. To prove it I've been sending him videos of me eating weird things, like sour gummy worms dipped in mustard, and beer mixed with milk.	Honestly I'm getting quite depressed not being able to taste food. I'm only on day 4 of losing those senses. I can't imagine going weeks or months without tasting anything. I feel like I should just drink smoothies with vitamins because eating is just infuriating me. For those who have the same symptoms, how are you coping? Edit: My fiance is not an asshole, he just didn't understand that I lost 100% of my senses. As I explained in a comment, he thought I had dulled senses where things just tasted bland. That's how he experienced loss of taste when he's been previously sick. I did the videos in a joking around way. He's taking very good care of me. My post wording just came off wrong.

My body aches are going away, I’m smelling better than before, I haven’t gotten the chills at night and never had any shortness of breath or coughing. There was this app I would get on all the time where I would talk to all my friends and it kept me going, but when I tested positive, I just felt depressed and stopped getting on.

When to go to hospital?	"So a relative of the family got a fever on July 2nd and got tested. He did not get his results back until July 9th which came back as positive. He already knew he had it by then as after July 6th, he seemed to feel worse every day. I've heard now that he has been in bed for the last two or three days strictly and has been coughing a lot. ""Worst he's ever felt"" is what he says. He's like 62, doesn't smoke or drink. Not too overweight, and works outside mostly doing electrical or hvac work (so not a couch potato). I remember back in like February, seeing some kind of ""covid symptom"" timeline which basically started with one line and then around day 9 the line split, either you were on the road to recovery or the other line was on the road to death... Not sure if was day ""9"" but you get the point, you either get better or start getting worse and it seems to be well documented at a specific day. So the question is, when should you go to the hospital?"	"When to go to hospital? So a relative of the family got a fever on July 2nd and got tested.

Help me crowd-source a viable sniff-test for back-to-school. What can you NOT smell?	First, I’m sorry you (or your family) caught Covid, and I hope you’re on the road to recovery. Please help me create a sniff test for Covid-19 that is inexpensive and easy to administer at the start of each school day. I envision a cotton ball in a small glass container (baby food jar) with a few drops of food extract (or essential oils). The teacher has maybe four of these, and puts one in a holder on the door-frame to the class room, open, just prior to the start of class. Kids give if a sniff as they enter the classroom. Teacher asks the class what they smelled (give four choices and asks anonymously in an age-appropriate manner). **I want to know what you can’t smell.** Is it mint, vinegar, oranges, vanilla, coffee, lavender, etc.	Help me crowd-source a viable sniff-test for back-to-school.

My family and I ( F 20) tested positive. Minorities in LA	My father (49) remained an essential worker, got sick and infected us at home. We live in south la so we live in a relatively small home where we couldn’t go to another room, different restroom, or even socially distance ourselves. My dad had more of the traditional symptoms that were being reported. Despite being sick over a week, and my mom(39) and i beginning to feel symptoms, he was denied the ability to get tested and was told to go back to work by his doctor. He refused to go back to work and instead my parents got tested a couple days later since LA started providing free testing to la residents.

What symptoms are next?	Last Wednesday I have a close contact with a COVID positive individual. Before that occurred I already have post nasal drip, a slight cough, and severe congestion. I chalked it up to allergies but my school made me get tested on Friday. 8/21/2020 = NEGATIVE. Relief flooded through me, but I was sent home to isolation anyways. The cough and congestion stay pretty constant BUT today 8/26/2020 I have lost my sense of smell and taste. I’m pretty scared I was actually positive this whole time. I have a test scheduled for 8/28/2020 because of the new symptoms. But I’m wondering what symptoms are usually next? Is it odd I tested negative and then got this symptom a week later, after having no contact with anyone since 8/27/2020 when I was told I had close contact? Thanks for any advice, I just want to go back to school which seems like an impossible task now.	What symptoms are next? Last Wednesday I have a close contact with a COVID positive individual.

Updates on airlines and flying?	Are there any recent studies on covid infection rate on airplanes? I have searched for this, but everything is either months old, or seems like PR for the Airlines. I would assume flight attendants or passengers getting sick could provide data... in ways that a grocery store can’t provide data. But I don’t see anything. I know airlines are doing reduced capacity, removing middle seats, cleaning tray tables, etc. but we need data and analysis. Because all that sounds good and well intentioned, but where are the reports if its working? I’d like to visit my folks soon, but don’t want to put myself or them at unnecessary risk. I would wear an N95 mask, but again I have no idea how effective that is. Obviously it is less safe than staying isolated, but how much more so than going grocery shopping for instance?

My Covid Timeline	Things have been going semi well since I had covid, so I figured I'd finally go ahead and put my story so far in its own post. 24F, only preexisting physical condition is being a bit overweight. Working on that in hopes of making continuing symptoms easier to deal with.

Trying to figure out if this is COVID	I am a 28M in Florida who has no underlying illnesses/conditions and up until today I noticed a couple of weird things. First, slept in most of the day a little bit more than usual. The past five days however have been my wife and I doing a lot with family and trying to get some sun while maintaining a safe distance, so it could just be my body needing a rest from the constant activities.

First, slept in most of the day a little bit more than usual. The past five days however have been my wife and I doing a lot with family and trying to get some sun while maintaining a safe distance, so it could just be my body needing a rest from the constant activities.

COVID19 Fear and Self-Loathing in Pittsburgh	I (50m) believe that I caught a very mild case of Covid back in February without knowing what it was. I did go and get tested in March as I had been reading more about it and realized that I could have had it. A local drive up testing site was established and I got my results back within two days and they were negative for Covid. The test may have been correct in that I wasn't currently infected but the test did not have an anti-body component to it. The symptoms went as such. I first had two very strong full body chills like none other in my life have I ever experienced and then a mild fever for one night. Once that first 24 hours was done I had a very mild tickle cough for almost three months that eventually subsided in early July. The other symptom that has stayed with me since March up until today has been a mild itchy rash on the top of my feet and toes and fingers that turns the skin reddish and a little bit scaly. The rash doesn't hurt, doesn't have big welts like hives and it comes and goes	COVID19 Fear and Self-Loathing in Pittsburgh I (50m) believe that I caught a very mild case of Covid back in February without knowing what it was.

Anxious about returning to work	I'll start with a brief description of my case. In my state they got ahead of the curve and managed to flatten out the cases during the initial wave. The state and city decided to reopen the bars and the gyms and after going through a break up and a rough few weeks I decided to go out with my friends because I was tired of feeling sad. Unfortunately the cases began to spike over the weekend due to people who were probably unaware they were sick or flat out did not care. My night out was 6/27. I started feeling a sore throat on Tuesday(6/30) evening around 8pm. The next morning the soreness persisted. It wasn't the worst, ive experienced more pain with strep throat. After a Google search revealed that sore throat was an early sign of covid-19, I wanted to be cautious so I self-isolated in my room for the whole day Wednesday (7/01). My sore throat was gone by 2pm Wednesday. After sleeping the majority of the day and waking up with what I thought was a mild fever I went I the next morning (7/02) to get tested.

Crippling Nightly Leg Pain After 60 Days	I had a mild case of COVID19 starting on March 22 with symptoms ranging from loss of smell/taste, chest pains, and body aches. Most symptoms started clearing up after two weeks. Nonetheless, I still had intermittent nightly leg pain (in the bone -not the muscle- from the knee down). Recently the pain has gotten more intense and consistently comes every night. It's also spread to my femur. My doctor isn't seeing anyone in person and was only able to prescribe pain killers. Has anyone else experienced this? Has anything helped? Could it be something unrelated to COVID19? I'm looking for some advice from someone in a similar situation.

Apparently Positive	First of all, I'm so glad this sub exists. The quarantine isolation was bad enough, but now that I'm sick, it's lonelier than ever. I'm 42M. I have an underlying heart condition- arrhythmias. I've been paranoid about catching the coronavirus ever since I first heard about it, so I was social distancing to the max- staying home, ordering everything in, quarantining packages, washing groceries. Then on Tuesday, I have a tachycardia attack. The worst one in 10 years. I couldn't breathe. I was turning blue. I couldn't talk. I was on the verge of passing out. So I had to call 911. The paramedics offered me a mask, but I couldn't wear it because I couldn't even breathe without a mask, let alone with one. The emergency room was packed with covid cases. The halls were lined with them. I was sharing a bathroom with them, and airspace. When I stabilized, I did put a mask on, but even the masks aren't 100% airtight. That was 4 days ago, now I have a fever of 100.4. I told my doctor, and he thinks I might be covid positive. I'm just waiting to see if he can get me tested.

Just came back positive - mental health TW suicide/self harm	I just got told a few hours ago I'm covid-19 positive. My symptoms at this point are essentially nonexistent, however my fiance is more high risk than I am. We both have mental health issues, but I have extremely bad depression and mood swings. I've heard stories of covid being mild just to get worse. I've been having suicidal thoughts and I'm absolutely TERRIFIED of what's going to happen. My main risk is that I'm overweight, he's overweight, diabetic, and a smoker. I just want to hold him, and my cat, curl into a ball, and cry.

Positive and negative results on the same day. WTF is going on here	Beginning Sunday I started experiencing a very minor soar throat. It went away Tuesday morning but was replaced by minor congestion. I assumed it was due to the bad air from the fires (I live in SoCal), but wanted to be sure. Wednesday I got a rapid antigen test. About an hour later I got a call back that it was positive. I had some doubts about the accuracy especially since one of my roommates had just received a negative result a few days prior. That same day I went to get a second test. This one was a RT-PCR test. The results came back negative today. To further complicate things. Everyone I had been in contact with got tested when I told them about my positive result. So far they are all negative. However, I am still experiencing minor cold symptoms. I a third test today and am waiting for the results in the next few days. I am honestly at a loss. This whole thing is such a shit show.	Positive and negative results on the same day.

Concerned	I don't know if this is the right place to post but... My mother spends a lot of time helping the working poor and poor in my town. They call her when they need something. Two days ago a young lady (drug addict, alcoholic, known sex worker) called her for help. She wanted a place to stay after being released from jail (her mother and sister kicked her out for stealing) . My mother had to refuse to help her because she sounded very sick. The woman said she had headache, sore throat, tired and aching all over. My mom told her to get to a hospital right away to get covid test. The woman said she would but I really don't think that will happen. My mom and I are worried. This woman has an active social life and could be spreading the virus everywhere. We really don't know who to call for assistance. Our town does not have a stay in place order. They will most likely not find a place and enforce quarantine. Our mayor has starting opening up the city.

How long should I endure bad abdominal pain before I go back to the ER?	Two nights out ago of the blue I started getting chills and body aches around 9 PM. I felt so shitty that I just decided to lay down and sleep. I woke up at 1:30 AM and was extremely warm, nauseous, and had full body aches. I took my temperature with my home thermometer and it said 101. I mustered the strength to drive myself to the local ER to get tested, and after doing rapid covid, strep, and flu tests, all were negative. I was sent home with a diagnosis of some kind of viral infection they didn’t test for. What I hate about the ER, at least my experience, is that once I tested negative, you’re basically treated as a burden. It makes me not want to go back because I’m afraid of wasting their time. Today my symptoms have mostly remained the same, but instead of nausea, I have some of the worst abdominal pain I can recall in my life. It’s been constant since late yesterday afternoon, and sees to be getting slightly worse despite trying pepto and eating small snacks because that’s all I can really have an appetite for.

This was last Saturday, and a week later I haven’t had any symptoms other than my throat being in some discomfort like being itchy and for a day or 2 there was some sharp pain in my chest at certain times when I would inhale. my throat this whole week it hasn’t really gotten worse but it hasn’t gotten better either with a whole bag of cough drops. Everyone who lives there feels fine and have gone about like normal. I did get blackout drunk and throw up though, so I was sweaty, sleeping with barely any cover in a somewhat cold room.

I went in because people whom ive been in contact with tested positive no symptoms. Seeing as this is becoming very real as i see and hear positive cases from people i know. Last night, i had itchy eyes and sore throat. I related it to allergies. This morning i woke up okay. Achey. But i have back problems so I associate the 2. Today while at work. Im coughey. Almost choking. Not continuously but often enough. Still aching. I drank some tea kinda felt ok. Fast forward to now... my coughing has subsided a little but my aches are worse like i cant get out of a chair pain. I bought a thermometer on my way home and my temp was normal. Now im at 99.9. I was just outside and its 100. Needless to say im a little worried. I guess when it comes down to it what are people’s symptoms that have tested positive? What came first? How did you know?

Is it possible that I already had it?	I got very sick in February. During this time there were no confirmed cases in my country but I'm just wondering because I had never gotten sick this way before. If I had it, it was probably a mild case. It started with a very painful headache, that night I had to force myself to sleep because I couldn't handle it. Then I got a sore throat and cough which wasn't exactly dry, you could hear the phelgm but I was never able to spit it out. I also got a stuffy nose and chills all day but got worse at night. The symptoms seem normal. What worries me is the fact that I got a sharp pain in the bottom of my lungs when breathing too deeply and I had to take deep breathes sometimes because I felt agitated (like when you take stairs). When my nose cleared I noticed that the mucus was brown (like old blood). Also the cough lasted a month but it was mostly myself trying to get the phelgm out. Nobody in my house got infected. Was this a common cold?	Is it possible that I already had it? I got very sick in February.

Anyone else experiencing lingering kidney pain?	Off and on I keep experiencing sharp pain in my sides, that can only be attributed to my kidneys.

If you have long lasting symptoms, do you also suffer with seasonal allergies?	I’ve just been reading something and it got me thinking. I know at least 8/9 people pretty well who it seems extremely likely have had coronavirus. All cases have been mild but still occasionally debilitating- in line with many here. Of those people, me and 2 others have had symptoms lasting longer than 2 weeks. All 3 of us suffer with seasonal allergies. My brother in law had mostly a dry cough and sometimes a fever and fatigue. He got ill early January and took 5 months to fully recover. Hope for us all? My friend had the most severe symptoms and was in bed for a few days I think twice but two weeks apart. Fever, cough, severe fatigue. She got ill in February and took 2 months to recover. Her allergies are the mildest. I am still trying to shake off chest tightness/soreness. Sore throat. Very mild cough. Some fatigue. I’m 3 months in. My allergies as similar to brother in laws. His case makes me hopeful the next few weeks will bring relief.

Possible relapse after 3 months?	Hey guys, 21F here who was presumed positive by my doctor back in mid-March. Originally I had a quite mild case but just very odd symptoms, had never really felt like that before. I had a phlegmy cough for a few weeks and super intense body aches for two days along with a burning skin sensation, though my temperature never read as a fever. Along with all that I lost my appetite for about a week, and my sense of smell and taste was significantly diminished. I also had some pretty serious IBS type symptoms which I had never experienced before and was suddenly intolerant to coffee which is still no fun :( All in all it was pretty manageable and I only felt really crappy during the two days of body aches. I spent the next couple months feeling pretty good physically aside from some really heightened anxiety about the whole COVID situation, but I am on medication for that now which seems to be working nicely. I got back into skateboarding regularly and never experienced any tachycardia or lung problems. Flash forward to now: For the past few weeks I have been dealing with pretty annoying GERD/acid reflux	Possible relapse after 3 months?

Can Someone Go To The Press Regarding Long Term Infection?	In this subreddit, there's so many people with 60+ days of infection and symptoms, but no where in the press is anyone talking about it. We need people to go the press to create awareness about it, so that scientists and doctors will start to conduct research on the long term issues and not just vaccines, prevention and ventilators. Thank you so very much!!!!!!!!	Can Someone Go To The Press Regarding Long Term Infection?

Has anyone actually fully recovered?	As in, all symptoms completely gone? I've had symptoms since the end of February. Started out as intensely painful sore throat, turned to runny nose, then sore throat disappeared into relentless cough (esp at night) for 2-3 weeks. Feel probably 90% better now, still coughing once in awhile everyday. Asking because last week I felt A+ besides the occasional cough so I went for a run. Afterwards cough got worse and had chest pain and trouble breathing for 24-48 hours after. I feel great again now but too hesitant to do any sort of exercise until I'm 100% over it. If anyone here has completely recovered how long did it take you? I'm pushing 6 weeks with symptoms now.	Has anyone actually fully recovered? As in, all symptoms completely gone?

Long Term Effects?	So, we suspect my mom had COVID back in February. She was in close contact with a friend who came back from China and went through multiple airports. This was before we knew what COVID was. And she had all the symptoms. Cough, loss of taste, breathing problems, fever of 102 for 5 days. It was the sickest she had ever been. Now, her doctor thinks she has had it too but we are wondering if she is suffering from long term effects. She has never regained her energy. Taking a shower knocks her flat. She can't even really stop sleeping most of the day. And randomly, she will get fever spikes that will go away within 8 hours along with headaches. Are those typical reoccurring symptoms? This has been on and off since February. Nothing else will be wrong but she will get tired, get a headache, and her temp will spike. It's so weird. Any thoughts?	Long Term Effects?

Question about what Medicines to take!	Hi all! I’ve been stalking this sub for about a week now. I was tested yesterday after I called my doctor and described my symptoms and they recommend the test. I also work in healthcare so they were more willing to do the test. I am still awaiting test results! In the meantime, I am experiencing symptoms. Since Sunday 5/31 I have been experiencing dry cough muscle aches and pains brain fog tachycardia at rest (could be anxiety) headache sinus pressure headaches off and on hot and cold flashes off and on tickle (almost like the beginning of an allergic reaction) in my throat and chest fatigue While I am awaiting my results, what medications should I use to combat some of these symptoms? I haven’t had a fever yet. I know that a fever is my bodies natural defense system, so if I get one I don’t want to suppress it too soon with Tylenol. Thanks in advance!! Also sorry for any typos (I am not the best at grammar/typing)!	Question about what Medicines to take! Hi all! I’ve been stalking this sub for about a week now.

How long did it take for you to get your results back?	Hi guys! I was tested Wednesday morning at about 9am. All the doctors I talked to were convinced it was going to be positive. I had a video call with a doctor yesterday afternoon and she said I should be getting the results today. I’m not sure if they give them after 5pm so I’ve been waiting and feel like I won’t hear back today. Is it mainly negative if they take longer to come back? I mean it’s only been 2 days.

COVID Quarantine, Season 3	Hi! I’m a veterinary technician who has been deemed essential throughout this whole mess. I had just gotten a new job when everything started getting serious stateside. I took 2 weeks off (borrowed PTO) to stay at home while my company figured out what measures they would take to keep us and our clients safe. I went back to work and about a month later I tested positive for COVID. Apparently, my boss had it. I spent 2 weeks at home, then had a negative test. I never had any symptoms and my family never showed symptoms. Here I am now, 3 months after that, with another positive test. This time, I’m symptomatic. Started as a very mild sore throat yesterday morning, then evolved into bad cold symptoms. Diarrhea, congestion, fatigue, headaches, brain fog, etc. Not sure what to expect next. I’m so tired. I wear my mask religiously, change its filter, clean the mask itself, wash my hands, use hand sanitizer, wear gloves, social distance, follow all the recommendations. I only go to work and home and the grocery store as needed. I’m frustrated and so over this. I think I just needed a place to rant among people	COVID Quarantine, Season 3 Hi!

Dizziness, nausea, and slightly stuffy throat	My cousin just got tested positive yesterday and I was last in contact with him Friday the 7th. I know it’s been over 14 days, but I did recently start having bouts of nausea and fatigue starting around last week. I thought it was because my doc put me on a new medication for my acid reflux that’s stronger than what I was taking before, but hearing this news today is worrying me. My only symptoms right now are fatigue and stomach aches/nausea. Gonna get tested tomorrow just curious if anyone had these symptoms?

The most prominent of signs of recovery is that I'm beginning to smell again. It's not at full capacity, but I can definitely tell that my food has flavor and taste once more.

After over 3 months of a messed-up sense of smell, I'm finally back to normal!	I tested positive in early June after getting a sore throat and suddenly completely losing my sense of smell. My overall symptoms were relatively mild and I never had a fever. I just felt kinda crappy for about 2 days, but if I hadn't known better I probably would have taken ibuprofen and gone to work. After about 2 weeks my sense of smell started to return. But sometimes I would get a weird smell in my nose for a day or 2 like something burnt. Also random stuff would smell wrong. The 3 biggest ones were garlic, mint and alcoholic beverages. I could definitely smell all those things, but they smelled wrong. I was starting to think that maybe I'd never recover fully. Then this weekend, my wife made garlic bread without thinking (she knew I didn't like garlic anymore). I tried it and it tasted normal! I tried smelling the jar of minced garlic we have in the fridge and it smelled normal too. My mint mouthwash tasted normal tonight and I just enjoyed a Dark n' Stormy which tasted amazing.

Worse diarrhea ever + extreme throat pain out of nowhere?	I didn’t test a positive but got extremely sick and have had problems ever since in late January. Background - Upstate NY, SUNY collehe with large amounts of students from JFK airport and international student. I think it’s realistic I could’ve had COVID.

I could be eating a sandwich, and it’s like immediately swallowing anything feels like swallowing sand paper with glass superglued on my throat. It goes away in ducking minutes or seconds too, which is the most perplexing thing to me.

Recently Recovered	Hi everyone, I just want to share some of my symptoms and the things that helped me stay comfortable while I was sick. I am in my late 20s, BMI is 32, not sure if blood type matters but I’ve seen people mention it so I’m O+. My first 2 days of symptoms, I had a scratchy throat that was barely noticeable. Over the next few days I began to feel muscle spasms on my arms, legs and abdominal area, by day 5 of symptoms the spasms were happening frequently and I was starting to feel muscle aches as well. At this point my throat was in a lot of pain, I was tested for strep but came back negative. When I took a deep breath- almost felt like when you go for a jog on a winter day. By day 10 of symptoms, I had a fever and I couldn’t take complete deep breaths. I kept my Apple Watch to monitor my resting heart rate and it was in the mid 90s (my normal is mid 60s). The back of my tongue also felt swollen at this point, which also made inhaling a little challenging.

More Severe Wave? Or Reinfection?	I’ve had waves of symptoms since April 24 so approaching 10 weeks. Hope not to cause panic, just want to rule things out. Each wave started with fever/chills the 1st night then low grade fever, fatigue for 1-2 weeks after. There was a brief point of shortness of breath but never severe. Since Friday, I have been having rather bad chills and the fevers were pretty high every night, admittingly I work from home IT and had a weekend shift of on call so I probably didn’t get much sleep, but they just felt more severe. I saw my girlfriend Wednesday thru Saturday going to shop rite and dollar tree and McDonald’s so I fear I got lazy and didn’t protect myself and might have gotten reinfected. But I’ve got an appointment with a doctor in an hour, the fevers were just too much. Hitting 102 with bad shivers and night sweats. From here on out I’m gonna test this theory and not go out for anything, I’m staying at my parents so I’m thankful for that. And all my friends and family are just immune, claimed to have gotten it already. But I was curious if anyone thinks they	More Severe Wave? Or Reinfection?

Getting tested tomorrow	My girlfriend’s family members are essential front line workers who have patients in their facilities who have covid. They always get retested and it always comes back negative. My partner and i have our own apartment and only go out for essential items. Starting Wednesday night, i started getting heavy diarrhea which has yet to stop. This has caused me to have no appetite and i have consumed maybe 200-600 calories each day since Friday. On Thursday I started developing a slight cough, nothing serious. Mostly just caused by an itchy throat. Somedays the coughing i cant help and others i force myself to cough due to the itchiness. On top of that i’ve had a slight fever of 99.6-100.4. My normal body temp is usually 99.1 or so anyway. One day i’ve also had terrible chills but it only lasted one night.

They always get retested and it always comes back negative. My partner and i have our own apartment and only go out for essential items. Starting Wednesday night, i started getting heavy diarrhea which has yet to stop. This has caused me to have no appetite and i have consumed maybe 200-600 calories each day since Friday. On Thursday I started developing a slight cough, nothing serious. Mostly just caused by an itchy throat. Somedays the coughing i cant help and others i force myself to cough due to the itchiness. On top of that i’ve had a slight fever of 99.6-100.4. My normal body temp is usually 99.1 or so anyway. One day i’ve also had terrible chills but it only lasted one night.

Day 28 since symptom onset. Exhausted 24/7, low fever, shortness of breath, depression.	Age 20, no underlying conditions, healthy weight, nonsmoker. I tested positive sep 17th. Tested negative oct 7th (dont know if this even matters). Sep 16th-30th I was hellishly sick. Mainly respiratory symptoms, but no pneumonia. I got lucky. For the past week (days 21-28) Ive had shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, muscle aches, temperature range 99.5-100.5, sharp pains in lungs when I inhale deeply or sneeze or cough etc, headaches, feeling like total sh1t. Cant concentrate on my school work and it's all making me depressed. I'm kind of just venting. I want to feel like myself again. I want to go on a walk outside but it feels like I'm suffering from lack of breathing even if I stand in the shower or go take the trash out. I have a pulse oximeter. My resting oxygen is always about 95. After I do an activity like showering or taking out the trash and feel short of breath, it's 89-92. I literally have to lay on my bed and recover for a while from those mild activities. I was in good health before this. I was working out often. I was eating a good variety of healthy foods.

Weird Skin Rash- Thoughts?	I have had no other symptoms. I have mild allergies to pollen/dust/mold that have only ever manifested as sneezing/runny nose. And I have had allergies for several years, all symptoms pretty mild- never dermatological in nature. I am not allergic to any foods or anything else that I am aware of. I haven’t eaten anything different, type of laundry detergent hasn’t changed, nothing new in routine, no meds, etc. I have not left the house in about a month, my bf made a grocery run 5 days ago- I wipe down everything. We haven’t had any direct contact with anyone since lockdown (late March). I’ve never had so much as a heat rash before in my life so this is throwing me. I have an albeit -mild- bumpy rash on my stomach, chest, neck, back of neck and down the entirety of my back. Not too red or itchy. Feels more like a burning/pins and needles type pain. I’m in day 2 of this rash and it’s getting worse, seems to be spreading to my forehead, shoulders, and arms. Didn’t seem to respond to hydrocortisone cream at all. I believe it’s *possible* this could be covid but probably unlikely. Just	Weird Skin Rash- Thoughts? I have had no other symptoms.

How long did you test positive?	I recovered from Covid over a month ago and received a negative test after 14 days. I’m planning to see family soon so my wife and I got tested just to be safe and my test came up positive again. Anyone else have the same experience? I am fairly certain I don’t have it again as I have no symptoms but find it weird I had a negative test and now another positive a month later.	How long did you test positive?

Blood in phlegm a symptom?	Hi all! I just stumbled across this sub while looking for information on possible symptoms not typical of CV. I was exposed to someone who tested positive on 6/28 and myself was tested 7/2, still waiting for results. During this past week, I've only really developed a sore throat and slight cough. This morning, however, I coughed up phlegm with blood in it. Definitely didn't have a bloody nose and I really haven't been coughing a lot, maybe a like 5 coughs a day. Is this a possible symptom? I am freaking out and not sure if I'm overthinking. My breathing has been okay, I have been on/off with congestion and I feel hot at times but no alarming fever.	Blood in phlegm a symptom? Hi all!

Positive with no symptoms?	Short summary: There was a case at a factory that I work at where one of the guys tested positive so I've stayed at home since then. The last time I was at the factory was 9 days ago and I officially tested positive 5 days ago (only time I was out of the house). I still do not have any symptoms, maybe some pain in my eyes but nothing else... Anyone else experiencing the same thing? I am a male in my mid twenties with no pre-existing conditions.

Is anyone taking marijuana products to help cope with decreased appetite and anxiety?	lately I’ve been having mad breakdowns because I am tested positive and scared my parents will get very sick. we are all mild cases so far but I hear them cough and I spiral that it’ll get way worse. I don’t cough at all and doctors say I’m on my recovery. I’m a week in but have only loss my taste and smell. Due to this, I also barely eat so I feel like I am not exactly helping myself recover better. the doctor said I don’t really have to take meds since I’m not coughing or feel tired, at this point I’m just waiting for my senses to come back. problem is I haven’t smoked or taken edibles in almost two months. I am scared it might make the virus act up again or worsen my symptoms. though the doctor told me he doesn’t expect me to cough at this point in the journey, i read about how people get random waves of symptoms when they start doing normal things they couldn’t do while sick. just want to get my mind away from corona for a while but it’s so hard when it’s everywhere in the media.

Has anyone had the virus with a preexisting thrombophilia/blood clotting disorder?	So I thought I had COVID-19 as I had a horrible 5 week long illness mainly featuring the worst bronchitis I had ever experienced (but during the initial wave a weird bad sore throat, only one day of a spiking fever, dry cough that progressed to bronchitis with no sinus congestion whatsoever) in March-April with weeks of post-viral symptoms afterwards. I had a PCR test on day 27 - negative. Got the Abbott antibody test at Quest this past Monday - negative. So much for that, it wasn't even it. I still have what's now chronic costochondritis and I'm terrified of actually getting the virus after this bronchitis from hell. A new worry is the virus causing increased blood coagulation and clots/strokes/PEs. I have a thrombophilia - protein S deficiency. I had to be on bloodthinners for my entire successful pregnancy (had 2 miscarriages before that) and had a DVT on a certain birth control pill nearly 20 years ago. I suspect that most of the people having clotting problems and strokes have undiagnosed clotting disorders, as it's easy to go your entire life not knowing you have it (especially as a male - women may find out, as I	Has anyone had the virus with a preexisting thrombophilia/blood clotting disorder?

Has anyone lost their sense of smell, but still have their taste??	I (23f) am positive. I was sick about a week ago for 3 days... had aches, stuffy nose, fever and sore throat. My fiancé and I thought it was flu, as I haven’t gone anywhere. Guy in his office tested positive a week later, my fiancé got tested, and low and behold he has Covid.

just wondering how the hell i’m not so sick.	hey all. i went home from college a few weeks ago to chill out at my mom’s house for a week with my boyfriend. didn’t wanna deal with the corona mess at college. well, apparently one of us got it at college before we went home, because now we’re both positive... and my entire family is presumed positive as well. what’s really frustrating is that i go to a huge big 10 university and they’re not doing contact tracing, or even telling people in university housing if someone in their building has tested positive. dining halls are open and have limited seating, but people’s mouths aren’t covered when they’re eating, obviously... and oh god, the parties. i’ve hung out in people’s dorms but NEVER in a group of 10 or more, i get takeout instead of eating in the dining hall, i don’t even have a roommate to catch it from, and god forbid i ever went to a house party. we did pretty much everything right and we’re still sick. it’s disgusting how little certain universities care about their students now. anyways, my family is still waiting on test results. i know for damn sure that i have it,	just wondering how the hell i’m not so sick. hey all. i went home from college a few weeks ago to chill out at my mom’s house for a week with my boyfriend. didn’t wanna deal with the corona mess at college. well, apparently one of us got it at college before we went home, because now we’re both positive... and my entire family is presumed positive as well. what’s really frustrating is that i go to a huge big 10 university and they’re not doing contact tracing, or even telling people in university housing if someone in their building has tested positive. dining halls are open and have limited seating, but people’s mouths aren’t covered when they’re eating, obviously... and oh god, the parties. i’ve hung out in people’s dorms but NEVER in a group of 10 or more, i get takeout instead of eating in the dining hall, i don’t even have a roommate to catch it from, and god forbid i ever went to a house party. we did pretty much everything right and we’re still sick. it’s disgusting how little certain universities care about their students now. anyways, my family is still waiting on test results.	0

Negative Antibody Results, but Symptomatic	I’m on Day 51 of symptoms (shortness of breath, daily low grade fever, nausea, fatigue, chest pain / pressure, you name it). Im 32, NYC, otherwise healthy. Was tested on weeks 4, 5 and 7 for covid and all came back negative. Got chest x rays, ekg, d-dimer, urinalysis twice and everything looked good. Yet symptoms persist into week 8. And I just got negative antibody test results — making my doctor think it’s something else. I know there’s other viral infections out there, but this seems highly unlikely to me given how similar my symptoms are to what’s being reported (especially consistent low grade fever).

Sickness and symptoms for almost a week-getting worse.	I work in a salon that has just re-opened and I have been in contact with many people.

I knew I couldn’t go to work like this so for my peace of mind I signed up and went and got the covid-19 test. For the next 3 days I felt the same and slept through to Sunday (Sunday started having some nausea/diarrhea) Monday I started feeling a bit better but still spiking fevers and exhausted. I got my test back- Negative. Went to bed expecting to feel even better today.

Day 79, was starting to feel better for a few weeks , was probably 80% feeling better then suddenly today feel like I've been hit by a truck	I've been sick since march 4th. Was in the dealing with the after math of it all, trying to manage the lung pain. Have two puffers and have been told to take 1 gram of tylenol every 4 hours amd attempt some sort of activity for atleast 15mins a day that gets me moving. I did good at that for 10 days. Then today I woke up and felt like I had been hit by a bus. Usually after I use my puffers in the morning I dont cough at all untill close to bedtime and repeat. Today I was coughing all day, have lung pain felt in my chest and upper back and extreme fatigue where I just dont feel like myself . When it rains ( like it has been for 4 days) I find my shortness of breath is worse and so is my lung pain. Anyone else notice this ? I'm so frustrated. 79 days and I'm still like this? I just want to be able to enjoy my life.	Day 79, was starting to feel better for a few weeks , was probably 80% feeling better then suddenly today feel like I've been hit by a truck I've been sick since march 4th. Was in the dealing with the after math of it all, trying to manage the lung pain. Have two puffers and have been told to take 1 gram of tylenol every 4 hours amd attempt some sort of activity for atleast 15mins a day that gets me moving. I did good at that for 10 days. Then today I woke up and felt like I had been hit by a bus. Usually after I use my puffers in the morning I dont cough at all untill close to bedtime and repeat. Today I was coughing all day, have lung pain felt in my chest and upper back and extreme fatigue where I just dont feel like myself .

Pregnant Wife and I tested positive	I have a lot of questions, hope anyone can help me. Two Sundays ago, I got a really bad headache, with dizziness, heavily breathing and high blood pressure, that went on until Friday, but i was told by a doctor that those were migraines. By Saturday I lost my sense of smell and taste, but by Sunday I recovered the smell on my right nostril, and had little taste, by Monday taste came back, but smell was like at its 50% That same day my 12th week pregnant wife, and i, got tested, both positive. Me with mild symptoms and she was diagnosed as asymptomatic. By saying that, does anyone have any idea of on what day of the virus could we be? Or when we will be able to get in the same room again? As today i recovered my taste and smell like at 90%, but I'm getting tired easily, i feel like if i was running a mile, even when i just went down the stairs, is it normal? Im used to do lots of exercises and im afraid that it will take some time for me to be back. She's in normal conditions thanks God, and	Pregnant Wife and I tested positive I have a lot of questions, hope anyone can help me.

Thought was getting strep now not so sure/got better now 3 days in on antibiotics and pus pockets and pain returned one side	Hey y’all! -So last Thursday I developed a scratchy feeling in my throat. Thought it was just my allergies. - -On Friday, I woke up to my right tonsil in a lot of pain and by Friday night I had pus pockets on the right tonsil. Left one seemed relatively fine. -Saturday seemed a little better and got put on antibiotics through telemedicine. -Started my antibiotic as my throat was feeling better on Sunday just to be precautious. -Today is Wednesday and I woke up with my throat KILLING me. I have a slight headache as well and now have started to have a severely diminished sense of taste. I can still smell relatively fine but foods do not hardly have any* flavor, just sensations. My left tonsil is covered in pus pockets and I feel really fatigued. Is this just strep or should I be concerned?

Anxiety	F(21) - I really need someone to help me out and guide me through this, though I have no extreme symptoms that indicate I’m infected . I’ve been feeling extremely anxious ( I’ll read covid-19 news and though I would breathe normally the entire day , during that time I’ll panic and start thinking that I can’t breathe properly). The only covid19 symptom that I’m going through right now is Diarrhea which is making me extremely anxious. It’ll help me a lot if you just guide me through how to notice visible signs or whether I’m infected or normal.

Allergy meds didn’t fix my cough	I usually take my allergy meds right in the morning if I wake up with an itchy throat or sniffles and it usually always goes away once I finish my morning routine. Today, I got the same itchy throat but my meds didn’t do anything and I’ve had a very light cough. Like I just cough once every half hour or so to get rid of the itch. No fever and no muscle aches. Could this be Covid or just a bad allergy day?

When will my smell and taste come back?	Tested positive 24th March morning and been warded in the hospital. No fever since 23rd! Cough is pretty much gone. Yesterday, the room was really cold so I had a stuffy nose. Today morning I could still smell and taste my food, however, when it came to dinner time I pretty much couldn’t smell or taste (20% taste maybe?!). So therefore my only symptom is pretty much the loss of smell / taste and a bit of fatigue (because it’s hard to sleep at night here, bright lights, hard bed). I was wondering if anyone who has tested positive / recovered with this symptom could let me know how long this will probably last? Eating is one of my favourite things to do and I’m really upset now :(	When will my smell and taste come back? Tested positive 24th March morning and been warded in the hospital. No fever since 23rd!

Exposure Question	How long do I need to quarantine after being exposed to someone who has COVID-19? One of my coworker tested positive and my wife and I obviously have had relations and kissed and touched. I have not gotten a test yet neither has she. She is a deli manager at a high-end food retailer. So far we don’t have any symptoms and her job is telling her to come back to work after only two days of us finding out about my coworkers positive test. Do we need to quarantine for 14 days? Can you provide any CDC links?	Exposure Question How long do I need to quarantine after being exposed to someone who has COVID-19?

Asshole suitemate brought back COVID	Me and all my suite mates agreed that we were going to stay away from any parties, like our school told us to. Well my suite mates next door had a different idea. To start this off, in my dorm I share a bathroom with these two guys (they are in a suite of 6 people, and I’m in a separate one that shares their bathroom).They have been going to frat parties constantly and completely disregarding the damage that they’re doing. Well, yesterday I went through the bathroom and went to my friends room. My friend has his own room separate from the two people partying, so it wasn’t much of an issue. We hardly saw them, they hardly saw us. Anyways, so I’m chilling with my friend and the two guys open his door and stand by the doorway. One of them is just like, “we’re pretty sure we have covid, we’ve had symptoms for about 5 days.” He said this with a smirk like it was fucking funny. They’ve been going to frat parties nonstop, and spreading it everywhere. At this point I was feeling very uncomfortable near them, even with them just in the doorway.

Cannabis for headaches	So I know this is an odd question and I’m not even sure if I’m allowed to ask this here but does anyone else use marijuana for the headaches?? I don’t have extreme symptoms, I’d say a little above mild. I don’t have shortness of breath which is why I use marijuana for my headaches. Does this help anyone else? Should I not be doing it even if my breathing is quite regular? I live in a fairly conservative state so I didn’t want to ask the doctors I tested with (I know they’re doctors but it makes me feel nervous/judged &amp; that’s on me). I’ve found it also helps me sleep because I cannot for the life of me keep my eyes shut without wanting to cry from headaches. Again, I apologize if this is the wrong place, this is just the only honest forum I can find about covid-19.

First Symptoms?	Hey guys, I have recently been tested for COVID but I’d like to know what some of your first symptoms were. I know it varies from person to person but I’d like to see if they match with mine. So far (about the 4th day of symptoms) I’ve had a minor sore throat, mild coughing and a headache really. In my area the seasons are changing so it could be a cold or something but you never know which is why I got tested. If you can, please share your first symptoms within the first few days below!

can a COVID cough come and go in early stages?	Hi there! I recently was in close contact with a friend whose stepdad ended up testing positive for COVID. On the day that he told me this, I was experiencing a very mild dry cough, but the urge to cough only lasted a couple hours. The next day I woke up expecting the worst, but I did not experience the urge to cough at all. Today it came back, but again only for a couple of hours at most. I have zero other symptoms. Could this be COVID or just something else? I'm waiting for a saliva test result at the moment.	can a COVID cough come and go in early stages? Hi there!

Kidney issues but no respiratory symptoms.	Hello, 30M here. 3 days ago I came down with a rapid onset of fever, chills, loss of appetite and muscle pains, I thought it might be COVID but I never got the respiratory symptoms my breathing super clean, however yesterday I started pissing 20 times an hour and noticed there is blood and white blood cells in the urine. Has anybody experienced anything similar. My appetite hasn't come back either.	Kidney issues but no respiratory symptoms.

Very mild case. Don’t necessarily panic if you start feeling bad	I was exposed at work after a coworker came in having been unknowingly exposed after sheltering an asymptomatic positive in their house after hurricane Laura. Was back at work for one day and I was exposed since my coworker hadn’t started showing symptoms until the the next day. I wasn’t quarantined since they have the rules in place for being in close contact for over 15 minutes within six feet, which is basically a pointless rule to follow. My symptoms didn’t start until 10 days after exposure and it started with a fever of 100.7. I honestly didn’t even feel feverish, I only checked my temp for the hell of it. I went to get tested that day and the headache started which was honestly the worst part of my whole illness. My fever fluctuated a lot from normal all the way to 102.9 but still never felt feverish even when it was at its highest. Took ibuprofen sparingly which helped sometimes but not all the time and I mainly took it for the headaches. The second day after my symptoms started was mainly sinus congestion. I felt intense sinus pressure that caused a headache and a stuffy nose but	Very mild case.

Possible infection?	Hey guys... I’m really freaking out right now... Yesterday I had to use Walmart’s restroom and unfortunately my lighter fell out of my pocket, landed right on the floor. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. Washed my hands really good, put on gloves for the rest of the shopping. When I left the store and got to my car I took of my mask, did all the proper sanitation. Then I took my lighter out, put a pump of the sanitizer on a paper napkin and cleaned the whole lighter with it... I knew it was very risky and didn’t feel good about it, but did it anyway. I had a cigarette... I know I should have just bought a pack of new lighters. Few dollars are not worth the worry... don’t know what I was thinking. Anyway, I’m kind of freaked out today - about 24 hours later - my throat is feeling a little dry, almost barely scratchy. Could I possibly infect myself? Would you feel first signs within 24 hours. I’m really worried...	Possible infection? Hey guys... I’m really freaking out right now...

Long haul covid and working out	I tested positive late june. Im on day 77 today. It started with typical covid symptoms. By day 10 i felt fine enough to workout. I did some excersise and kept excersising. I was still sickish but started having more asthma attacks during workout. Eventually i stopped. I can only assume my immune system took advantage of that and kicked into gear. I started having muscle aches, inflammation, and feverish again. I tested postive again August 1st. I decided to just hang out till i felt better again. I just started having no asthma issues anymore and body aches went away so i decided to workout 2 days ago. I did 5 rnds with the heavy bag and i ended up having some asthma issues from mouth breathing. Yesterday i was fatigued and today i feel like complete crap. Obviously overexterion is casuing relapses. I still have sinus issues, feverish, and bad breath. I took antibiotics and scheduled a 3rd test to see if its covid.

I've been sick since early march and fear I might have become chronically ill	I've been continously sick since march. I've had all of the symptoms ranging from low grade fevers, dry cough, burning hot torso, night sweats, muscle pains, fatigue, skin rashes, red/blue feet and shortness of breath just by walking a bit. Right now most symptoms have gone away except the fatigue, shortness of breath, feels like my lungs are on fire and I'm having extreme intense sharp back pains that not even paracetamol combined with ibuprofen can dampen. It's most intense at night which can make it hard to sleep. I've been checked by my doctor several times and my blood work looks perfectly normal. At this point I've accepted that I'm chronically sick, because most of family members and friends who've had it recovered a long time ago. It also makes me depressed because I get the feeling some doctors aren't invested in you if you can't show that your blood work is abnormal. I've had a difficult time even getting painkillers prescribed for my back pain, and it feels harder being a young previously healthy woman. At some point I've felt like a drug addict - the stares, the questions, the anomosity.

Has anyone recovered from this?	I am 25 days sick already. My main symptom is a burning feeling, congestion and irritation exactly in the middle of the chest that makes me wheez and cough. Also the irritation goes to the base of my neck. It is so annoying and after 25 days I dont feel any improvement... It is discouraging to think I will never get rid of this. Please I need some good experiences from someone who has go through this and has recovered, since I already tested negative and my XRay is normal.	Has anyone recovered from this?

Tested and fearing results - Covid shame?	Hi everyone! I got tested yesterday 10/6 and my results just showed up online this evening. I haven't looked yet - my anxiety is killing me over it. That being said, I'm mostly afraid of admitting I got it to the people around me if it's positive. At work, my store has managed to not have any cases and we've been open the whole time. I know I'll get PTO if I'm sick, but I have this embarrassment that's scaring me more than the illness right now (what if they blame me if they fall ill? Will they be mad, or start rumors? Ect.) Has anyone else gone through this (or have I just gone nuts)? How have you worked past it? Did you get any kind of shame / negative pushback from the people around you?

Specially those who tested positive, did anyone of you use it??	0
I showed symptoms, so my girlfriend and I both got tested. She has showed no symptoms but her test came back positive. My test came back negative. How is this possible?	We are so confused. We’re going to get tested again tomorrow to find out if somehow there was a mix up or some sort of false positive/negative. Does anyone else have any theories about how this could be possible, or how we should handle it.	I showed symptoms, so my girlfriend and I both got tested.

Mild case symptoms so far.	Doing this to help others, cause it helped me. Think I got COVID19 at either Trader Joe’s or CVS. I wear a mask. Those are the only 2 places I didn’t wear a face shield, had my glasses on. But people were obnoxious at both places. Standing too close, wearing masks as chin straps or not covering nose. Please be responsible and wear your mask properly. And stay home if you test positive. Prior to testing (that Saturday Sept 12th), Sunday, Monday) I felt fatigued, husband said I snored terribly scratchy throat. Nothing alarming. Thought it was due to poor air quality. Fires are near me. Wanted to test to reassure myself it was nothing. Hahaha! Tested Monday results came back positive Tuesday. Tuesday: lack of taste, fatigue, body aches, tummy issues Wednesday: taste back, body aches worse , tired, scratchy throat, tummy issues Thursday: So tired, achey, needed naps. Friday: feel like getting the flu, scratchy throat, slight cough. Tired. Very achy. Loss of taste again. Tummy issue, , ringing in ears, mouth pain. Saturday: pain body aches, things smell odd tired, scratchy throat. Chest tightness, headache, ringing in ears, mouth pain, dizzy. Sunday: so far, woke up tired.	Mild case symptoms so far.

Does the shortness of breath go away?	Day 8. Fever down today. Less frequent coughing today. Less aches and chills. Smell returned. Appetite is back. Slept good last night. Overall seem to be finally recovering but I’m still experiencing shortness of breath. This is a rather new symptom, only started a few days ago. My pulse oximeter reads 97% even though I have trouble inhaling deep breaths (very shaky breath when I inhale). For those of you who recovered, does this symptom go away on its own? When should I go to the hospital? My insurance plan doesn’t start until May 1st btw so I can’t call any doctors. I have Oscar health simple secure plan. I live in NJ if that’s anything.

Empiric survey about covid positive and ABO blood type	I’d love to know about the ABO blood type and the severity of disease. I believe we could have some kind of survey here.

Mild abnormal symptoms — still tested positive	Hi, just figured I would share for people that experience something similar and aren’t sure if they should get tested. I’m 27F in good shape but I do have POTS and mild ME so I was terrified of covid. I developed some GI issues (brief diarrhea followed by major stomach aches), a few days later I got a horrible migraine that lead to me being extremely tired. I chalked it up as hormones because it’s that time of the month. However, Later that night my left leg and left arm started hurting like I had done a hard workout. I was more dizzy than usual but assumed it was just my POTS acting up. No fever. No cough. No loss of smell or taste. No shortness of breath. I got laughed out of one clinic, but couldn’t shake that the muscle pain was abnormal so I went to another where they gave me a test. By the next day I was already feeling more myself — walked 2 miles (masked and on an empty trail) and did some yoga at home. Still tired but nothing extreme at all. Today I got my results — It came back positive. So just	Mild abnormal symptoms — still tested positive Hi, just figured I would share for people that experience something similar and aren’t sure if they should get tested.

My update after testing positive	This by far has been the worst experience... Hear me out! With all the hubbub about this virus, I would have thought I was going to be on my deathbed... let me tell you that I wasn’t! 0/5 stars will not be shopping here again! But to be real it hasn’t been terrible, boring maybe but I guess being young and relatively healthy just turns the virus into a cold. I was scared I wouldn’t get my taste or smell back though, but day by day it’s coming back! TL;DR- for me this virus is all hype... I didn’t even throw up!

Covid relapse?	5’11 male 20 190lbs In early February I started to develop some very strange symptoms that I’ve never experienced before. I couldn’t eat, fever of 103, nausea/vomiting for about a month straight, a lot of mucus in my throat. Went to the hospital and they ran a ct scan on my abdomen and didn’t find anything. I was bedridden for two months, slowly started to recover. Ever since then I have had some issues breathing, not anything too worrying, just the feeling of not being able to get as much air as possible. On Thursday 8/5/20 I started to develop other symptoms. My breathing got a little worse, a lot of mucus, weird tightness in chest/throat (feels like anxiety), nausea, diarrhea, no fever, no cough. It has been going on for 5 days, and I just got tested today as I had to make an appointment. I don’t know if it is covid or not, or if my anxiety is just making things worse. Usually at night right before bed I get really bad panic attacks that last for quite a bit. Any input would be nice.

How are the days counted?	I've seen some people say that they start feeling better after lets say for example day 31. Is day 1 when you first start showing symptoms? Or is day 1 when you speculated you got infected? A month of constant pain sounds brutal and I don't know how you are all doing it.	How are the days counted?

QUESTION: How to convince family members to get tested?	"Hi! Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this, I'm not sure where else to find what I'm looking for. A friend of my family's tested positive for COVID like 3 days ago, several of my family members interacted with that person a lot last week and now some of my family have ""bad colds"". They haven't taken COVID seriously this whole time. They are high-risk in more ways than one. They say they're going to quarantine for ""10 days"" but I would be surprised if they stick to it. They don't think they need to get tested because they don't think it matters. I'm not supposed to know about any of the above, they are keeping it from me because they think I will be mad. I'm communicating with a sibling who still lives at home. How can I help my sibling convince them to get tested? Like what are the reasons for testing to present to Fox News minded people?"

Six months	It's officially six months since the first day I felt symptoms. March 11, 2020. The past few weeks I've actually started to feel better. Not completely well, that's a goal for next year. But I *do* feel better. Better than at the start of the month. Better than last month. Helluva lot better than back in March. Some of the things that are helping are getting enough sleep. Deep breathing exercises. Vitam D, Vitamin A, Zinc, and a daily multivitamin are doing wonders. Stay tough, everyone. We'll get through this together.

Stressed abt covid	I’m a 17f and I live in Cali with no health issues. My dad is a 50m, a retired navy seal, very healthy and fit except for back pain and PTSD. My mom is a 47f, a little overweight, always stressed, but healthy for the most part. I worry about my parents a lot and was wondering if anyone here maybe sort of knows that if they got covid, if they would be fine and wouldn’t have to get put on a ventilator. My biggest fear right now is that happening to them and it’s been really stressing me out, especially because the news makes it seem like everyone who gets covid gets put on a ventilator which idk if that’s true or not. I know that no one here can say anything super accurate about what could happen if they get covid, but I’m just looking for anything to make me less stressed.

When did covid come to the us?	10/15/19 I drove myself to a NY hospital due to: headach, dizzyness, and uncontrollably shakes. I remember them treating me as if I was overdosing, untill the TOX screen came back negative. Next thing I know I was out like a light. I vaguely remember being wheeled in and out of CT and CAT scans. Woke up around 2:00pm being told I need to go to a specialist and sent home. 10/16/19 Woke up with another headache, but this time: my whole body hurt, sore throat, fever. I called the Dr and passed back out. 10/17/19 Woke up could bearly breath and had: horrible body pain, headach, and diarrhea. I went to my Dr. appointment. Dr. told me I migjt have M.S. and set me up with a specialist. Never made it to the specialist, because I was the only one working. Time went by and the pandemic was hitting NY. Slowly little by little the symptom dissapeared. Next thing I know Governor Cuomo ordered the pause.

Negative antibody test 3.5 months after likely infection. Can antibodies fade that quickly?	28F. I live in NYC and I was sick with mild covid symptoms during the last week of February and first week of March. I was unable to be tested at the time because I hadn't traveled to China or Iran and I waited until June 30th to go in for an antibody test for fear of exposing myself in the event that I hadn't actually had it already. The test came back with a non-zero antibody count but far lower than the threshold to be considered positive. It's totally possible I never actually had covid but given where I live and the fact that I was taking the subway twice daily until mid-March and had just traveled through JFK I really thought the odds were good. Some of the symptoms I had were very unusual compared to anything I'd experienced with a cold or flu before. Is it possible that I waited too long to get an antibody test? Has anybody had a similar experience? Or did I most likely just have a regular old cold?

I’m really concerned	Hi, I’m really concerned about my heart right now. But before I get to that let me give you my timeline and how it’s unfolded for me. I got really sick back around April 13th. Had so many symptoms but could never get a test at the time because I never had a fever, lost my sense of taste or smell, none of the classic signs of COVID. But I had so many more. Very sick. Chills. Vomiting. Upper Respiratory Infection. Coughing. Sore throat. Post Nasal Drip. Felt slightly short of breath at times but my blood oxygen has remained constantly above 95. So as of yet I’ve never had no worries there. Got through all that. Felt great for around a week. Then came down sick again last Thursday feeling real week and tired. Then came the GI symptoms. Slight diarrhea. Excessive Gas. Very bad abdominal pain. Still have slight abdominal pain now. Absolutely no appetite. Still don’t have much of one. Haven’t been able to sleep.

Will it worsen my situation? Should I stop taking my antibiotics, just to be sure? If I got positive, do you have any tips on what	0
What does the back pain feel like in COVID?	I have some lower to middle back pain right now but I'm not sure if it's a symptom of COVID or it's because I'm seated the whole day (and with awkward positions). When I move my body I mostly don't feel any body pain. I just feel that I'm not as mobile as I should be. Like my back needs greasing. Although if I twist my body in certain angles I do feel slight pain or discomfort. I've had this for 2-3 days already. So for those who had body pain and tested positive for COVID, what exactly should it feel like?	What does the back pain feel like in COVID?

Full lack of taste or can it be less?	I had to go into hospital for another issue, and now a week later I’m getting a fever, strange headache, very sore throat, etc. Could be just another regular illness; I don’t want to block up resources by getting tested unless I absolutely need to, so asking here first. This morning I woke up with a strange tongue issue: it’s like I burned it on tea, but I didn’t. The central section is...weird, tastes almost metallic, but I can still taste maybe 40%. Markedly different but it’s not like everything tastes of wet paper, like people say. Did anyone who tested positive have this symptom, or is the tongue symptom always a full loss of all taste? Thanks for the insight and my sincere wishes for everyone’s quick and full recovery.	Full lack of taste or can it be less?

New symptoms after 2 weeks?	Tested positive 3 weeks ago after two days of mild symptoms, chills/sweats, diahrea, stuffy nose/drip Never had SOB or sore throat/lungs. felt totally fine for 2 weeks after, now having the diarrhea and nose symptoms again as well as: New symptoms: completely lost appetite, no nausea, so just force self to eat and it feels fine, just dont have that urge to eat. Every morning for first few hours breathing isn't short, pulse ox ok, but breathing causes mild pain in throat and lungs. Goes away after shower etc. Main question does this sound like Corona wave two and/or should i goto doctor again? I caught first time at doctors office so feel a little gun-shy.

Can I trust the test?	So I'm not sure if I waited long enough to take a test so I want to make sure. One of my bfs roommates tested positive for Covid on Tuesday. I was over at their place after testing negative the Saturday before from Friday to Sunday. I had ok amount of contact with the positive roommate. We usually stayed away from each other and we're almost never next to each other less than 6 feet for more than a few minutes. That roommate was not coughing or anything like that. Then after I left they randomly tested positive on Tuesday. My bf and his other roommate tested Thursday and we're both negative and I tested Saturday and got a negative result. Now I have no symptoms. By throat feels funny, but that could be just anxiety (it does not hurt at all). My mom tested as well since she had 6 days contact with me after I came back and I've had around 8-9 days contact. We went to CVS and did self swabs. I think I went far enough with it.

No cough or fever, just body aches and a dry throat. Getting test tomorrow.	For four days I've had these symptoms. It started out as a dry throat, leg tiredness, and general malaise. On day 2 that went away and it was just a dry throat. Day 3 I felt about the same except now my shoulders, upper back, and neck aches, and my throat hurts in my press down on it. I also had bouts of mild fatigue. Now I'm on day 4 and nothing had changed since day 3. The muscle aches are a little better, dry throat is the same. This is the weirdest illness I've ever had. Is it possible it's Covid?.	No cough or fever, just body aches and a dry throat. Getting test tomorrow. For four days I've had these symptoms.

Tested positive again!	Hi so I took my first test on the 15th and tested positive. I self isolated until the 25th and got another test done on the 27th. The 2nd test came back positive. Per department of health I should be okay to go back to “normal” since I shouldn’t be contagious anymore even though I still have a cough, fatigued and shortness of breathe, smell and taste maybe back at 40%? Per my doctor I should self isolate for another 14 days since I’m showing symptoms. Any advice?	Tested positive again! Hi so I took my first test on the 15th and tested positive.

Relatively good experience with covid?	I’m aware this is unpopular opinion and I’m down-playing the severity of the virus, but i had a pretty good experience with it. My only symptoms were itchy throat, mild body aches for two days, some sinus pressure that lasted 2-3 days and lost of taste/smell(didn’t bother me bc I could eat/drink literally anything). I got over two weeks paid leave and was able to catch up on my studies and exercise more so than normal(at home of course). All around it was a good mental health break. Has anyone else has a similar experience?	Relatively good experience with covid?

I was tested two weeks ago, test was negative (yay!) but today I get a horrible phone call...	My best friend I’ve spent the last few days with has now tested positive for covid. When we hangout we had both been tested already and were negative at the time and now since her boss said she was exposed as one of her coworkers had it.. she needed to get tested. She’s positive with no symptoms. We are both 22 year old females. I have Hashimotos but other than that fairly healthy.. What’s my chances you think? We didn’t drink or eat behind another and when we hung out she drove separate but I’m just worried. Getting re-tested ASAP. Will my insurance cover it twice... I have blue cross of N.C.

COVID presenting with Sinus Issues.....any one experience this?	So, for about the past month, I've been having weird sinus issues. One side of my face will be clogged up, nose clogged, sinus pressure, very slight cough and sometimes a low grade headache.. It will sometimes change sides of my face. I felt very hot and flushed on and off for a week or too, but no actual fever. I'm STILL, now, at week 4, experiencing the weird sinus symptoms. I DO have spring allergies, but never have had fall allergies. I tried, for, a week, taking Claritin, but it did nothing. I tried taking sinus medicine, which also minimally helped. I used a neti pot, which did help release alot of the mucus.....but just as quickly, it returned. I do work in my office 2x a week and wear a mask the entire time I'm there. The building is old, but no one else appears to be having issues/similar symptoms. Could this be COVID?	COVID presenting with Sinus Issues.....any one experience this?

Be careful - What I thought was a release appears to be reinfection.	"I posted on this thread recently about what I thought was a relapse, but now evidence strongly suggests to me it was a reinfection. Background: my husband and I had covid from late Feb through mid/late April (confirmed with a positive antibody test for my husband in early June. My antibody test was negative, but 100% I had it too: we were sick at the same time and my symptoms were classic, including painful deep breathing, continuing low-grade fever, bad headaches, changed sense of smell, etc). We were healthy from the end of April until June 12, when I experienced what I thought was a ""blip"". Based on comments on this thread, I assumed I was having a relapse (headaches again, low-grade fever, weird smell experiences). However, one week after my symptoms started, my husband also fell sick-- as bad as he was during our first infection. Given the circumstances of TWO people falling ill within one week of each other, I do not think it's likely we both had relapses coincidentally at the same time. More likely: Either I relapsed, became contagious and gave it to him, or I caught it somewhere and gave it to him. Be careful"	"Be careful - What I thought was a release appears to be reinfection.

Tested Negative after 4 weeks, but feel even worse than before!	"Hey, I tested positive for COVID around April 16th. I felt like my mouth was widening, had no smell or taste (Tongue was swollen with metal taste) Bad case of anxiety and insomnia, and breathing issues. I isolated in my room after being tested positive. It was and still is hard to even get a few hours of sleep due to my anxiety. My nasal passages are blocked. My ears are blocked, I literally cant breathe properly from my nose properly. After 4 weeks, my symptoms started to die down, ( My mouth still has that feeling of ""opening up"" as if its detaching from the my skull, ears and nose still blocked, sleep still messed) but it was looking better. I ended up being tested negative but my symptoms have all came back extra hard. My stomach keeps irritating, my upper abdoment hurts, I lost my smell and taste again, my top teeth feel off as if theres air stuck behind them, tongue is swelled up, my jaw hurts and I have alot of neck pain now.

Test results just came in - Positive	Day 1 of symptoms (Mon): I started feeling ill while at work Monday morning. Everything was fine when I woke up at 3am but by 9am I started getting a fever and my legs were getting achy. I told my boss I wasn’t feeling well and he sent me home. By 8pm that night the achiness had spread throughout my body. Day 2 (Tue): Had aches and chills throughout the night, woke up at 6am feeling sore, checked my temperature and it was 102, throat was sore and nose was slightly runny. At 10am I decided to go to my local clinic and get the COVID test. Symptoms persisted through the day and that night. Day 3 (Wed): Same as the past two nights, with little sleep. Symptoms still there and continued on through the day. Day 4 (Today): Woke up at 5am and got my test results back at 8am telling me that I was positive and have to quarantine until the 22nd.

GI Covid?	Covid outbreak at daycare. 8 cases among kids, 3 teachers, 2 parents (so far). My daughter is presumed positive and my husband has tested positive. Husband started experiencing more traditional symptoms Wed during the day (fever, respiratory). Wednesday night I had the worst indigestion/stomach cramps/reflux of my life, and have had relatively infrequent diarrhea since. Certainly, a bout of norovirus feels worse, but the cramps were pretty intense. Does GI Covid show up this way? Is it more likely I’m just really anxious about this whole thing and it’s coming out in my body like this? Daughter and I test today. Wish us luck!	GI Covid?

Day 3 is today and he is off and on fever, he said he feels like he’s in a lot of pain. Feels like vomiting and he said he felt like he was going to pass out. I need some help with outlook for him.

What was the moment where you realized “ I think this is Covid-19.”	Obviously the test would be that moment, but I’m just curious, what was the first moment where you thought to yourself... “ Okay this is more than allergies I think I’m actually sick.” Since this pandemic began there has been so many times where i had that funny “off” feeling, one time had a temp of 100.01, and now If I feel funny I try not to think too much about it.

Prednisone for headaches and breathing?	Symptoms (the timeline is estimated): For months now, post nasal drip. Probably started in Nov but never did anything about it. Just dealt.

Then a week or two later my lymphs under my jaw really swelled up and was sore. Also lasted about a week. I only mention because I've posted with other having similar lymph issues before the primary symptoms began. Days 1-4: Fever. I think around this time I have an odd heart palpitation.

Lend some positivity to a terrified long hauler that wants to feel normal again?	Its day 97 for me now. ( 24 y/o, AFAB ) And to be fair a lot of my symptoms have been doing a lot better in this past week. Really im mostly dealing with the spike in heart rate from simple tasks, a few small heart palpitations, and headaches here and there. but even those are slowly but surely getting better. ( My normal resting heart rate fluctuated between 60-68 when i was healthy before infection. post infection months in it was at about 68-80 on an off. sometimes more than that! now its getting back down to low 70's high 60's ) ive been seeing a lot of long haulers in this group talk about how theyve been dealing with this thing for months and months, but none of their antibody tests are coming back positive. i saw another person make a claim that it takes at least 4 weeks of being symptom free for your body to produce enough antibodies to show up in a test, which i guess makes sense if your body is too busy still fighting SOMETHING off months later. i guess im just wondering if other long haulers are getting better/experiencing less symptoms?

Exercise and Immune-suppressor	Used to hit gym 3x a week with cardio/HIIT and lifting, pre-sickness. It has been known for a while that strenuous exercise suppresses immune function. Especially when your body is trying to recover and NLR is still not great, exercise is counter-productive. In fact I attribute my infection to over-fitness. From now on, Yoga/calisthenics/Pranayama will be my staple program. And yes, supplementing with L-thenine is good as it boosts NK cells, and calms you down as well. Same with ashwagandha. For hardcore bio hacker, measure your th1/Th2 dominance and supplement accordingly.	Exercise and Immune-suppressor Used to hit gym 3x a week with cardio/HIIT and lifting, pre-sickness.

And yes, supplementing with L-thenine is good as it boosts NK cells, and calms you down as well. Same with ashwagandha. For hardcore bio hacker, measure your th1/Th2 dominance and supplement accordingly.	1
Anybody experience body aches afterwards?	So I tested positive positive about 60 days ago. It was a mild case no hospital. I’m presumed recovered but still have body aches all over.

Corona and Gym	My boyfriend refuses to stay in our apartment and goes to our gym everyday. He says there’s usually just like one other person but it makes me so nervous. He says he’s taking precautions. We live in San Antonio which is now a hot spot. How likely is he to catch the virus there? I already expressed my concern to him and it doesn’t matter. He says it’s for his mental health.	Corona and Gym My boyfriend refuses to stay in our apartment and goes to our gym everyday.

To those sick with kids, or with sick kids...	How is it? Does it slow your children down? Does it seem as bad for them as it does the adults on the sub? Do you worry about them or does it seem manageable? Have you been watching their O2 sats? Thanks! I’m a pregnant nurse trying to decide if I should vacate my home for a few months to spare my uninsured husband and 4 year old daughter.	To those sick with kids, or with sick kids... How is it?

How long until you ended your quarantine?	I started having symptoms on July 4th and tested positive on the 9th. VDH recommends you stay quarantined for 10 days since your symptoms started, but I plan on waiting 10 days since my test so that means I could potentially end my quarantine on the 19th...but I just don’t know if I feel right doing so without a negative test result. I spoke to a nurse at my testing center about testing again and she advised that I could still get a positive test result without being contagious. Thoughts? How long did those of you wait before you went around people again?	How long until you ended your quarantine? I started having symptoms on July 4th and tested positive on the 9th.

Does continued loss of smell and taste mean I still have the virus? Also hoping to hear from people who experienced loss of smell and taste.	My symptoms began a little more than 2 weeks ago, I had a raging headache and an itchy rash on my arm... The following week I was congested for 3 days, experienced night sweats, body aches, and random fits of sneezes. Oh, and complete loss of smell and taste. I’m a little over 2 weeks since the symptoms began, about 2 weeks of no smell or taste, what are the odds that I am still contagious? I live with my family and have been isolating myself in my room. The only symptom I am experiencing these days is the loss of smell and taste which has been extremely unnerving. I’m no longer congested, but do feel a bit of sinus pressure along with a slightly sharp sensation in my nose at all times. Does anyone know if the sinus pressure directly related to the loss of smell and taste? If so, it’s pretty scary. It feels like that slight pain is what is causing the damage to my senses and the longer I feel it the more damage it’s doing, I’m worried of being one of those who never recovers their senses which is pretty depressing....

Just about to finish week 2.	I thought I’d feel good, but I kind of feel scared. I had what felt like a heart attack day 3, I’m afraid i get another worse on the 2nd wave I won’t make it. It nearly killed me. Also have it go after my brain. Feels like it kind of picks diffeeent areas to go after, then feels swollen but does heal. Generally. Including in the back. I’m hoping that the adage of “if you make it past the first two weeks you’ll probably survive” but mybcase doesn’t seem very average. If you had similar issues I’m welcome to here them. If not just wanting to vent. I’m scared of the road to come. I know I shouldn’t worry, but I do sometimes. Feels like I better get this problem solved, or another wave might push me over.

How do you convince doctors to run tests when you have symptoms for longer periods of time? Not being taken seriously anymore.	I’m on 7+ weeks now of active symptoms. Oxygen level is normal, but the pain while breathing and shortness of breath is constant. I’m always exhausted, always having a tightness in my chest. I’ve seen some posts on here about post viral syndrome and doctors running bloodwork. I’ve gone to walk in clinics, spoken to my own doctor, done virtual doctors appointments, and they all have told me the same thing. Symptoms linger and there’s nothing they can do. And I totally get it, but I feel like every single day is a struggle and I really don’t think I’m being taken seriously. I had another test done, and I am still positive for covid while minimal with antibodies. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

After effects?	Hey all, so I had it really bad in March and April- sick for three weeks straight, temps of 103 and above, chest pain, etc. Now I've been healed for a little over four months, but I still experience wheezing and minor chest pain from time to time, although it never lasts for more than ten minutes or so... is anyone else who had it experiencing this?

Did anyone have sharp back pain? Fatigue and diarrhea as well? And no cough?	I am starting to think I need to get tested. I'm a server and have been working through this, but a week ago my father got bad diarrhea. My boyfriend has had a slight cough off and on and I've also just started with diarrhea. Today I woke up with a sharp back pain. Like terrible. From up in my neck to on the left side of my shoulder blades. No coughing at all, but I have noticed I'm having a harder time breathing. I get really bad allergies this year so idk. It's this random stinging backpain that ibuprofen is not helping.	Did anyone have sharp back pain? Fatigue and diarrhea as well? And no cough?

Doctor thinks it’s my body just reacting to massive amounts of inflammation and stress. I haven’t been “normal” for 4 + months and am feeling deflated. I see that over the counter yeast infection medicine is low every time I buy more at the store was curious if perhaps it was Covid related! Anyone else?!

Fluttering in lung?	Presumed positive, mild enough that my doc told me don’t get tested and ride it out at home. I’m on day 12 and I still have a constant fever, cough/SOB/chest tightness has slowly gotten worse, extreme fatigue, sore throat, headache. Yesterday and today I started feeling a gurgling, rumbling, or fluttering feeling where my lower left lung is. It’s internal, not surface, but closer to the back. Same spot every time, it happens more if I’m on my back or hunched over, and happens very often. Is this anything to be worried about or anyone else experience this? My O2 fluctuates from 97 to 99 throughout the day which isn’t concerning.	Fluttering in lung? Presumed positive, mild enough that my doc told me don’t get tested and ride it out at home.

No fever, but a few other symptoms (described below). Has anyone with similar symptoms had it or know anyone who has?	Hi everyone. So I noticed a **slightly sore throat and a slight cough** late last week, but it was minor, so I dismissed it as being related to allergies or marijuana smoking. Then, today I woke up feeling nauseous and experienced some **bathroom problems (you know what I mean lol)**. I almost felt hungover (I get awful hangovers in relation to my stomach), but I didn't drink yesterday and barely drank on Saturday. I have **NO fever**, though. I felt weirdly sweaty this morning, though I guess I could attribute that to 80 degree weather. By the time I got to work this morning, I just felt too weird to stay. I live in Denver where the cases have spiked a lot lately as well. I have a test scheduled for tonight. I am a little concerned about missing a lot of work waiting for test results if I don't have it, but I figure it's better safe than sorry. I have heard of someone who had it, but dismissed their symptoms as allergies and continued hanging out with people. I don't want to be that person.

After being sick since March 11: Part 2	&amp;#x200B; Edit and info update below: TL;DR: no real answers, but did get a referral to pulmonologist that seems interested in figuring this out. **Original Post:** Link to Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/gsh9rs/after\_being\_sick\_since\_march\_11\_tons\_of\_tests/fsnekeg/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/gsh9rs/after_being_sick_since_march_11_tons_of_tests/fsnekeg/?context=8&amp;depth=9) \*The doc is going to run a bunch of blood tests, check d-dimer, test for covid for antibodies, regular swab for good measure, and something else that I can’t remember. May do a ct with contrast. Previous ct was clear. 34/M very fit. Still have sob, diarrhea, lung pain, fever, tachycardia, night sweats, lower pulse ox, etc. If anyone is interested, I can follow up with what they find. Let me know.\* **Additional Post:** All the blood work came back. They ran a hematology - complete blood count, coagulation studies, chemistry, thyroid profile, TB skin test , and Abott IGG antibody test.

Toddlers with covid?	My nephew has a high fever right now (39,4) and is in the covid department with his mother where they will do the tests and such. Other than fever he doesn’t have any symptoms... Me, my mom, brother and his wife have all been in close contact with my nephew so I’m really scared all of us might get sick. Also how dangerous is covid for a child under two years?

Dizziness as a symptom?	For about three days I have been getting nausea at night. I didn't think much about it. It's odd but I didn't think covid. Today I woke up with the weirdest sore throat. It's more like the air burns in my chest when I breathe. Then I noticed my arms felt tired washing dishes. I can get health anxiety so I tried to be positive and just ignored it. Then suddenly while sitting on the couch I got randomly dizzy. So dizzy I called my husband at work and he's coming home. Should I be worried it's covid? I'm trying not to be overly concerned if none of this matches up. I feel sorta like you do the day before a cold...the tiredness.	Dizziness as a symptom?

Anyone having vision problems even after healed?	My boyfriend and I both tested positive in March and are healed now, but my boyfriend seems to have this eye pain and vision problem that hasn’t gone away since. The pain started while he had covid (red eyes, pain when blinking, etc) and now he’s having trouble seeing. He thought maybe his vision had just gotten worst and contacts weren’t strong enough but doctor said his vision is the same and didn’t know what was wrong. All they saw was that his cornea looked inflamed. They gave him some steroid eye drops but they’re not doing anything. Wonder if this is a side effect of covid? I did see an article that it affects the eyes. He is extremely frustrated. Anyone have something similar?	Anyone having vision problems even after healed?

Quarantining at home w/ 55M Dad Who Tested Positive	My husband and I are heading to New York City this fall for my graduate school and we decided to come stay with my Dad and Stepmom for about 6 weeks to save money before we go to NYC. We’ve been here about 3.5 weeks and about a week ago my dad (an essential worker) got a cough. Today, he came back positive for COVID19. We don’t have any particularly unique experiences to share, but I’ve been lurking on this sub since March and just wanted to contribute our story. Dad is 55 and generally healthy. Blood type B-. He certainly doesn’t feel great, but in general it’s been only a cough, headache, and fatigue. No one else in the household has symptoms. I was pretty scared of someone I know getting it, but luckily it seems so far that our little Covid-positive household will be ok. In other news, my husband and I can’t get tested because we aren’t symptomatic or legal residents of this state. So that’s ~neat~. Thanks for reading. Hope all of you dealing with Covid in yourself or family get better soon.

Can I get your opinion on a doctor who denied my grandma a test? She's positive now, and it may have saved her a horrible fall that broke her cheekbone and cause internal bleeding.	"Hi everyone, My grandma tested positive Sunday, May 24. The weekend prior (the 17th) she complained about ""chills down to her bones"" and then all last week she complained of body aches. She went to her doctor sometime during the week (not sure the exact day) and was denied a test. However, her doctor ASSURED HER that she did NOT have COVID-19. We still don't know the exact details of the doctor's visit, since she only really told my grandpa the details, and he has done his best to relay what she told him (it's not much). WELL fast-forward to Saturday, May 23 -- about a week after the symptoms first appeared and a few days after the doctor visit. My grandma was so out of it and dizzy that she fell - hard - and she's 79 years old. Her body is so fragile. She didn't immediately want to go to the hospital, despite my grandpa telling her to. It took my uncle visiting her on the morning of Sunday May 24 - and he called her an ambulance upon seeing her condition. Now my grandma is alone in the hospital in critical condition, hooked up to a ventilator."	"Can I get your opinion on a doctor who denied my grandma a test?

Fever for 4 days after intense quarantine	I’ve had a low grade fever (101 and below), body aches, and fatigue since Friday. I took a test (the mouth swab kind) on Friday but it came back negative. I guess I’m confused because I’ve been very intensely quarantining. I’ve only seen people outside and at a distance. Should I get another test? Also if it’s not COVID, how would it be possible that I caught something else since I haven’t seen people? I haven’t had a fever in many years.

Senior mom has symptoms, possibly Covid?	"First off, we are in contact with her doctor so I'm not expecting anyone here to be our doctor. But Covid is so insidious with a wild array of symptoms, I want to see what you think. My mother is 70 years old and suffered a heart attack last year, from which she recovered really well (EF is now above 50). She also has mild asthma. So she is very much in the ""high risk"" category for Covid. She was scheduled to have long overdue knee replacement surgery today. She got a Covid test just as a pre-surgery precaution on Sunday, and tested negative. But early this week she complained that she wasn't sleeping well, waking up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep. This happened 2-3 nights in a row. Other than feeling a bit out of it from lack of sleep, she didn't feel sick until a few nights ago, when she said her stomach felt upset. If she laid down in bed it felt okay but being up and moving around she felt some nausea. Yesterday, she woke up feeling a little better and ate some toast and peanut butter.

Long haulers, be careful on your Vitamin Intake	Just a PSA to be careful on taking your vitamins. As desperate as we are on finding a cure, you could cause damage like me. I’ve been haulin this long since April. Desperate to find answers and get my life back, I started taking extra vitamin D in May. Aside from my Centrum Multivitamin 1000 IU of vitamin D, I took extra 2000 IU of vitamin D everyday to keep under 4000 IU daily limit. I stopped taking it in June cuz it was giving me these nightly fevers/chills and I recently got a blood test for general checkup to find my calcium levels were elevated, a sign of vitamin D toxicity, that’s great. Vitamin D is fat soluble so it lasts in your system a while so I’m definitely taking it easy, sticking to multivitamin. But still a word of caution to take it easy out there on the vitamins. On the downside I’m still having relapses so ruling that out. Someone mentioned an overactive immune system so I removed dairy and processed foods and excess carbs from my diet. No more fast foods, salad with every meal. In a week Once I’m back home, I’m switching to a	Long haulers, be careful on your Vitamin Intake Just a PSA to be careful on taking your vitamins.

Phlegmy and slight discomfort (tickly) when inhaling in lower throat / trachea	"5 days ago i started to feel a little bit ticklish when inhaling deeply (you know, the feeling when you inhale cooked chili) in my lower throat. 3 days ago, that area started to produce phlegm. I got a very minor body chills at night, but no fever (prolly due to anxiety of catching covid) on that day. I slept it off, expected it to worsen on the next day. Turns out the body chill resolved itself when i woke up. Now, the only symptoms i have is phlegmy and slight discomfort when inhaling in lower throat / trachea area. The discomfort isnt strong enough to make me cough, although i coughed a lil bit here and there (1/2 cough per episode, only hving 1/2 episodes per day). Constant ""ahem"" ing to clear my throat from phlegm though No fever, no chills, no major fatigue. Only slight fatigue that comes and go but this might be due to panic and anxiety.

My experience living in a COVID-19 hotspot	So I wanted to share my experience because while I haven’t caught COVID myself, my life has been greatly affected by it. I also want people to know that it is possible to protect yourself from infection even when it seems like an impossible situation, since I know many people are suffering from anxiety over the possibility of getting sick. I live in area with a high rate of COVID infections. All our hospitals were at capacity and we had to convert our local convention center into a makeshift hospital. We landed on the national news once or twice because of how high our infection rate is. This is in south Texas. While I’ve avoided getting sick myself, I know so many people who have gotten sick and tested positive. From friends from school, former coworkers, family, and current coworkers. Almost all of them recovered and are fine now, but pretty much all of them described it as the worst sickness of their life, and most were sick for at least 2 weeks. I don’t think any of them suffered long lasting symptoms, except maybe 2 (they are both significantly overweight, which I’m sure contributed). Even then, nothing severely debilitating.

I didn't think too much of it until she was telling me her fever comes most at night which I know I have seen a lot of people talk about. She is going to the doctor this week and hopes to get tested but I did a little googling and found a small % of people who presented with skin conditions first or got them while hospitalized. I am trying not to read too much into this because I realize this could be totally unrelated but I was just curious if anyone else has experienced this. Their is no rash but it is kind of red with lines and most prominent on her hips and thighs.	Did anyone experience itching/skin issues?

Did my co worker possibly have Covid?	My co worker missed a week of work. He came back and said he felt like shit the last week but his test came back negative. He had a low fever 1 day. He coughed for 3 days. Nausea and blue colored poop. And was sore. He said it was from Sunday when he first felt off and by Friday he had began to feel substantially better. By the next Sunday he said he felt good as new. Could he have had Covid? Or did he possibly catch the summer flu or something else? I'm asking because now I'm worried if he had Covid he came back and spread it to a lot of us at work and infected us.	Did my co worker possibly have Covid? My co worker missed a week of work.

Had a virtual visit with doc, would love to test me but of course I’m not an at risk group	I’m a 24 year old healthy male with anxiety (health anxiety to be exact) I have been at home for about 10 days now, rarely ever leaving because I can work from my room. My symptoms began last week with a sore throat for a couple days (not a strep feeling) like I just knew I was catching something &amp; also diarrhea. Which then became a runny nose, stuffed nose at point, watery/itchy eyes, sneezing all day, rarely would I cough maybe 2x a day, but I’ve had this extreme lower back pain that eases some days and then comes back, highest my temp has been is 99.1, oxygen levels have been reading 97 and above. Woke up today and feel like I have someone sitting on my chest, oxygen levels have been normal all day it’s not a pain but it’s like a heaviness, no cough really still, no wheezing, no fever, and I’m congested while also my voice has changed. I just don’t get it, like I get it could be a cold, my allergies as well but this sucks during this time, if Covid-19 wasn’t in the picture I’d probably be going about my normal day.

day 35, steadily getting worse for 15 days so far. Trigger warning, possibly.	I've gotten worse everyday, slightly, for the last 15 days. I kept thinking I would be able to beat this thing if I just kept holding out. I hope that is the case, but I think my available days are lessening. Everyday, my breathing gets a little worse. Everyday, my other symptoms get slightly more severe. I think my blood isn't oxygenating correctly, even though the pulse ox say 95 to 98. I think I might have the symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension, that started a couple days ago when I started coughing up blood. Now, I can't lay on my back without nearly passing out. blood pressure swings when I can't breath, dizzy, extreme fatigue like I'm going to faint, I can't think, I'm starting to lose control of my body(limbs, walking.)

3 Days ago diarrhea and vomiting (Nauseous), today morning hives	Hey guys, on the 16th I felt nauseous, puked and diarrhea'd. I went to the doc the next day (17th) and he diagnosed me with food poisoning but I was feeling much better already. Fast forward to today 22nd morning I woke up to hives and as I'm typing this my hives are kinda flaring up a little. I'm kinda scared, but I have a question. Has tested positive people have symptoms and then goes off then a few days later another symptom happens?

Length Until Test Negative	I began showing symptoms for COVID on 6/10. I tested positive on 6/12. My symptoms were mild- I had a sore throat starting 6/10 then a fever that was gone by 6/12. Yesterday (day 6 of symptoms) I lost my sense of taste. I had virtually no symptoms from day 3-6. A bit of tiredness, maybe. I am wondering how long until a retest will show up as negative for Covid? My doctor said I only need to quarantine for 10 days meaning I would be fine to stop quarantining this Saturday, but I wanted to get retested as well. Although, I am now reading, I may show positive for covid for a long time after I stop being contagious. I was wondering how long it has taken others to receive a negative test?

Recovered from covid, zero antibodies	Hi all, A bit disappointed right now. On the 24th I tested positive for IGM antibodies, and no IGG. Today I tested negative for both. According to this, my body developed zero memory against COVID, and even though I JUST recovered, I could already get it again. Am I understanding this correctly? Or is it possible this was a faulty secondary rapid test? I’m in mexico.	Recovered from covid, zero antibodies Hi all, A bit disappointed right now.

COVID &amp; Anxiety / Depression	Ive posted my story about a week ago. Tomorrow makes 2 months of still feeling shitty. For those who have tested positive &amp; have been sick for so long, if anxiety / depression settled in how did you handle it? I’m so tired of being tired &amp; this has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I’ve tried meditating, hot showers , yoga breathing, music even Xanax to calm the nerves a bit . I’ve also been taking vitamin b12, D, Folate, &amp; fish oils in hopes that’d help a bit . But at this point I think my body is just exaughsted. Any ideas would be awesome .

My girlfriend entire family got it, except for her dad?..	She lives with her grandma, grandpa, cousin, mom, and dad. Everyone has symptoms except him. They all got tested and everyone came up positive except for him. Anyone else having this oddity or seeing it? It’s a small house so social distancing wasn’t done in the house, and he’s still asymptomatic 2 days later from test day, while others are losing taste and smell. He works from home, kisses the mom everyday and has dinner with them every night. He’s 100% been exposed. I can’t seem to figure out what’s going on.

I have shortness of breath (chest pressure) which makes it harder to breath but no cough.	Me and my dad and sister have all had shortness of breath for a few days now (most likely coronavirus) but no other symptoms .. would the shortness of breath still be due to phlegm in the lungs?

Constant urge to clear throat?	At the beginning of March, my mom was in the hospital for a week and I stayed there with her. That’s when I started having this symptom of a sensation that I need to clear my throat. Sometimes my throat feels tight, like it does when you are about to cry. I chalked this all up to anxiety because my mom was very ill with cancer (and has since died). The same week she was in the hospital, I developed GI symptoms (diarrhea) and a low fever off and on for a day or two. Again chalked it up to stress. This was all before covid just exploded in our area. It is now two full months later and I still have this throat sensation every day. Some days it’s awful. Sometimes I feel like there is something in my upper chest— some congestion. I never cough anything up. In addition, some days I have bad fatigue. I have a virtual appt with an ENT tomorrow and am wondering if I should ask for a covid test. Has anyone else had these types of symptoms?	Constant urge to clear throat?

Oblivious Roommate Came Back Coughing	Hi all I'm 23F living in Europe. I share a studio apartment with a new girl, who I'm not particularly fond of but we get along decently. She's been in the hospital visiting her boyfriend who had surgery last week. Yesterday she returned to spend the night and was coughing throughout it. Not coughing fits, but light non-mucusy ones. I woke up coughing too. I asked her in the morning if she had meds, and she just shrugged before heading out to her job interview. I'm peeved af. I've been trying so hard to avoid going out/putting myself near people in general. I can't change the living situation. She clearly gave me whatever she has and I think I've got to go get retested for COVID now. Anyone have advice for me? Vitamins? Other preventative measures?

Partner and Friend Tested Positive - Me &amp; Daughter negative.	So... Basically my partner tested positive last Thursday. After showing symptoms around Monday. (Mild) I did a test on Saturday just gone along with my 2 year old daughter and received a negative results on both today. Her friend also tested positive today also did the test on Satuday. Basically i live her and share everything with her etc. We all went out on the Friday before. Partner, Daughter and Friend together. So is it possible i just didn't catch it along with my daughter?. I have no recollection of symptoms in the past. I was also on Immunosuppressant etc so basically at a higher risk while she was showing symptoms. Currently only thing i have is body aches midly and a bad headache and tiredness no fever etc. I am putting this down to stopping my Immunosuppressant medication and biological medication.

Has anyone had the back of their throat swell up badly?	I woke up this morning with the back of my throat incredibly swollen - tonsils swollen, uvula (hangy ball thing in the middle) incredibly swollen and elongated to the point it can get stuck on my tongue. Everything is so swollen it’s somewhat difficult to swallow and even talk. My voice is all garbled, and my tongue feels almost like it’s coated with something so that my sense of taste is dulled. Have an appointment with doctor at 4 pm, and based on other symptoms (off and on low grade fever for past week, slight cough, deep sinus congestion, on and off body aches, some nausea over the past couple of days) they are having me come in the back entrance and wear a mask. Triage nurse said to expect to be tested (probably because I am immunosuppressed). This throat swelling just popped up overnight. Has anyone else experienced this?

Re-infection possibility?	I had COVID about a month ago. I had some mild symptoms and overall it took me about two weeks to fully recover. I had an out of state family member pass away a couple days ago (not from COVID) and the small, socially distant services will be next week. I know research hasn’t conclusively determined how immune people who’ve recovered from COVID are from a second infection. What I’m asking is do you think it is safe to fly versus drive? If I am exposed to COVID on a plane or in an airport will I likely become re-infected when it’s only been a month since I initially had it? Like I said, I don’t know if anyone can actually conclusively answer this for me, I think I’m just looking for a little advice.	Re-infection possibility? I had COVID about a month ago.

Epstein Barr as an aggravating factor?	https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-21580/v1 Most people are infected with the chronic Epstein Barr virus. However, it becomes more activated in some people and leads to autoimmune issues/fatigue etc. It may be that some have a higher viral load of it because the conditions in their body allow for a faster viral replication. The paper I linked shows that many of the Covid patients this team tested in China, also had acute Epstein Barr especially if a fever was present. Furthermore, some of the weird Covid symptoms like rashes, tingles and swollen glands are also symptoms of Epstein Barr. I am not a scientist nor am I a medical professional. I’m just Covid positive going on week 6 and digging for answers. I thought this could be a potential relationship that might interest some people on here and warrants further investigation. PS- although Epstein Barr is chronic, L-lysine, vitamins C and D and Cat’s Claw tincture are said to help lessen the viral load by slowing the replication rate.

Symptoms for moths, exposed at work. Feels like previous illness years ago. 40y/o M	Here is something weird. We had a really odd illness going around my old job site back in 2012. People had severe runs, fever off and on for days. Heart PVC's /racing and runny nose for months. Someone had came back from a trip and spread whatever this was. I ended up losing 41 pounds in a month. Every test I did with every doctor turned up negative, every single one for whatever they tried to find, NOTHING. I originally thought I would be diagnosed with something serious and die. I did recover, those things went away, but I have had very odd fatigue off and on for years, trouble sleeping. Problems with my stomach that have never went away. Onto current COVID situation. Fast forward to this year, in late Feb.

How long did you wait after quarantine to return to the gym?	I normally lift weights 5 days a week but I ended up with Covid. I’ve been cleared to quit quarantining now as of yesterday but my mom is urging me not to workout yet in case I somehow end up getting worse again. She said she’s heard people will think they’re better and then return to regular activities too soon and end up worse than before. Is this true? I think I feel normal again but I honestly don’t remember what it felt like before I had covid hahaha	How long did you wait after quarantine to return to the gym? I normally lift weights 5 days a week but I ended up with Covid.

you can 100% catch covid again, forget what the experts say, i got reinfected and am struggling to breath again, exactly like the first time	after 8 weeks of long haul symptoms ive caught it again, there is no doubt in my mind, accept the incubation period is so quick this time, my whole face and eyes were stinging hours later then my nose went numb and smells played up, now 2 days later i am literally gasping for air again like the first time, do not go anywhere stay at home, if you dont have antibodys you hve zero immunity	you can 100% catch covid again, forget what the experts say, i got reinfected and am struggling to breath again, exactly like the first time after 8 weeks of long haul symptoms ive caught it again, there is no doubt in my mind, accept the incubation period is so quick this time, my whole face and eyes were stinging hours later then my nose went numb and smells played up, now 2 days later i am literally gasping for air again like the first time, do not go anywhere stay at home, if you dont have antibodys you hve zero immunity	2

Is anyone here who is a diabetic (Type 1 or 2) and tested positive for COVID.	I am asking because I know that people with health conditions like asthma, cancer, diabetes, people with heart problems, etc have a higher risk of getting hit severely by this virus.

Did anyone actually have symptoms last less than a month?	Hi! so I think I had covid around the end of February. I went to Disney, and five days later I woke up with a dry cough that felt like someone was sitting on my chest. By the end of the day I had a fever, chills, and aches. The fever went away after the first day, but every now and again I would get aches and chills throughout the two weeks that I had it. The cough though my god, it was like razor blades were in my lungs. I couldn't talk, and a one point I had a cough/breathing that was very crackly. I did tela-doc, and they told me it could of been an upper respiratory infection/cold and bronchitis. I also had shortness of breath. My mother ended up getting it as well, and she had a fever for two days, and was fatigued for a week or so straight. However, I never had a sore throat during my two weeks ordeal, and my nose wasnt stuffy to the extent it normally is with a cold. I've been thinking I already had it, but with some of the accounts I've been reading where people have had it	Did anyone actually have symptoms last less than a month?

Tested positive and still recovering	I hope that just one person reads this and it helps them take this more seriously. Please remember everyone is experiencing COVID differently so I wanted to share what I went through so others know what they might expect. Background: I'm a 27 year old male who was working from home, only went to the store every two weeks and other than taking my dog outside for bathroom/walk never went outside and haven't seen anyone other than my wife since March. I do live in an apartment building but otherwise I don't know where I could have gotten it. I always wear a mask anytime I step outside my door and wash my hands religiously. On 7.8 in the AM I was totally normal. By lunch I was tired and had a very slight cough. By dinner I didn't want to get up and was just tired and coughing maybe every 15 minutes. My wife got home from work and isolated herself from me. I was tested the next day (rapid test) along with my wife. I was positive and she was negative. We have a small 1bdrm but she stayed out in the living room and basically locked me	Tested positive and still recovering I hope that just one person reads this and it helps them take this more seriously.

Anyone sick in March and have a cough return last week?	I am asking because my 3yo son began having leg pain with some swelling. The next day I took him to the ER where they diagnosed post-viral transient synovitis. He developed a cough that same morning. No exposure to sick people, hasn’t been anywhere in months and no one else in our household is catching this. It sounds like the cough he had in March with presumed COVID, but without any of the other symptoms he had back then (GI symptoms, loss of appetite, runny nose, red watery eyes) Background: Passed through my house in March. 6yo daughter had GI pain and loss of appetite. A few days later I developed scratchy sore throat, very mild cough, moderate headache and moderate body ache. My symptoms resolved in 2 days. Days later 1yo daughter was sick but only noticeable symptoms were runny nose and maybe a mild cough. My 3yo son started having GI issues and loss of appetite that day. A few days later he had a runny nose and started coughing. Cough got worse over the course of the next two weeks (very unusual) before resolving after 16 days.

My grandfather got diagnosed, but his symptoms went away	So my grandfather had mild symptoms for 4-5 days and then tested positive. Shortly before the test results came back, all the symptoms went away. Right now he's in the hospital just as a protocol and he's perfectly fine. I want to know what to expect for his condition. Does symptoms going away mean he's in the last phases of the virus? He's a 74 Male.

How easily did you catch Covid-19?	I'm wondering how people who have been so careful and had very minimal contact with others have got the virus. I've been inside packed buses almost daily, delivered food up several apartment buildings touching elevator keys and doors in Downtown of a hotspot city. I'll admit, I haven't been doing my best social distancing with a lot of people I run into daily. In my dad's job so far there have been about 180-200 infected which is a lot in his facility. I'm surprised my antibody test came negative last month. I was hoping it was positive cause that would mean most likely everyone home had it at one point but never had it bad. I'm thinking those airborne allergies I've been having were the cause of my headaches, fatigue and body aches.	How easily did you catch Covid-19?

Any vitamin recommendations?	Hi everyone. I was exposed to covid last weekend, got tested this previous Wednesday, and got back positive results today. Any recommendations on what vitamins I could take to boost my immune system and hopefully experience as little symptoms as possible? As of right now I just have a mild cough/sore throat along with a diminished sense of taste. Thanks!!	Any vitamin recommendations? Hi everyone.

Who's recovered and only had mild symptoms?	I'm feeling pretty anxious reading posts where people have been extremely sick for weeks and weeks. Have any of you, or people you know, tested positive with only mild symptoms? Or at least were only badly sick for a relatively short period?	Who's recovered and only had mild symptoms?

Does anyone know a vaper/pothead who got covid and how it turned out for them? Are you one of them? Tell me how it went.	My husband is a healthy guy but he dabs a LOT. Dabbing is like vaping but with a heated titanium nail and a gooey concentrate extracted from pot. Like all day long everyday. He's productive and everything. I just worry about if he gets the virus if he will have worse respiratory symptoms and be in danger. I don't know what all the younger people have in common who end up super sick or die. My husband has not had any symptoms at all yet. I'm awaiting my own test results because I had symptoms earlier this week. They have subsided a lot. I never really ended up ramping up at all and it's Day 6. The cough and breathing symptoms may just be my regular ones that I have all the time because of post nasal drip. I don't know. If we've both been exposed I worry for him a lot. I just never see enough information about how young guys that vape a lot end up handling the infection.

Breathing problems?	Never thought I'd be posting here but I'm curious as to what the symptoms have been like for other people. For the past 4 days, it's gotten increasingly difficult for me to breathe. I think it's important to mention that I have asthma, which can be triggered by extremely cold or extremely hot weather. For the record I don't have any of the other typical symptoms such as a fever, cough, or lethargy. Is it possible that I have the virus? Has anyone else been diagnosed with just the respiratory issues as the symptom? Fyi yes I have made an appointment with a doctor but I don't know when I'll be seen.	Breathing problems?

My employer is asking questions that make me wonder if they think I am faking.	I was tested at a drive thru center last week after I've started with shortness of breath, chest pains, feeling feverish, chills, shaky feeling inside and extreme fatigue. I work in alarm and CCTV systems. My company didnt get us any PPE until after Louisiana was #1 in rising cases. My job brought me in contact with hundreds of people spanning the state from Baton Rouge to Lake Charles to Houma to Shreveport. I don't currently have a doctor so I called the local call center and was sent to a test and am now waiting for results. The owner of my company has called three times in a week wondering why the testing takes so long and that they have 15 minute tests and this is awfully strange. Today I called my old doctor today because the chest pains were a little worse yesterday and I got a bit worried. They wouldn't see me, told me to stay in quarentine unless it's an emergency. Meanwhile my employer is now asking for doctor's notes that I can't get. I really really wanna tell these fools to take a hike because my health is more important than someone's smart home system	My employer is asking questions that make me wonder if they think I am faking.

Help! Need guidance for parents	Hey everyone. Really need help here. My parents just moved form another state and they had to hire a moving company to assist. The movers are doing job after job, and who knows what or who they have been around. Talking to my mom, they did not have masks on the whole time and obviously they are handling my parents belongings, bringing them into their new house. We want to go visit them but I have a son who is under a year old and we can’t take risks until my parents get tested to confirm they don’t have Covid. My question for everyone is how long after possibly being around someone who COULD have the virus, can they be tested to confirm that they are fine? Thanks in advance...	Help!
