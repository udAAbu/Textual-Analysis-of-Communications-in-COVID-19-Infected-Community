Textual Analysis of Communications in COVID-19 Infected Community on Social Media (Final Project of DSGA 1011)

*The full report is listed as **DS_1011_Project_writeup***

**_Abstract_**

> During the COVID-19 pandemic, people
started to discuss about pandemic-related
topics on social media. On subreddit
r/COVID19positive, a number of topics are discussed
or being shared, including experience
of those who got a positive test result, stories
of those who presumably got infected, and
questions asked regarding the pandemic and
the disease. In this study, we try to understand,
from a linguistic perspective, the nature
of discussions on the subreddit. We found differences
in linguistic characteristics (e.g. psychological,
emotional and reasoning) across
three different categories of topics. We also
classified posts into the different categories using
SOTA pre-trained language models. Such
classification model can be used for pandemicrelated
research on social media.
